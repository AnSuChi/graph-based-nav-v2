  "transcript": "which is something that many of you follow but we also follow for related reasons obviously being a technology magazine technology trends are are something that we write about but also it 's part of being any monthly magazine you live in the future and we have a long lead time we have to plan issues many months in advance we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months nine months down the road so we 're in the forecasting business we also like a lot of companies create a product that 's based on technology trends this case ours is about but the concept 's quite the same but also very importantly when the timing is is everything and it 's interesting when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the or internet advertising they were all right they were just wrong in time and that 's why timing is everything you 've probably seen something like this before this is the classic gartner hype curve which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology 's lifespan and just for fun we put a bunch of technologies on it to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak or whether they were about to crash into the the trough of disillusionment or rise back in the slope of enlightenment etc and this is one way to do technology forecasting get a sense of where technology and then anticipate the next upturn we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important we 'll typically do it twice once we want to do it first we want to be the first to do it for the geeks who appreciate that we 'll catch it right there at the but then it comes back and sufficiently big technologies and that i 'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my grand unified theory of predicting the future but it 's it 's based 's based on the presumption the observation even and at each one of these stages can be seen as a collision a collision with something else for example a critical price line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world it 's an inflection point and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be and maybe how you it will tend if it 's successful to rise above a critical mass a penetration you know the first but hasn 't done displacement yet and hasn 't done free yet there 's still more opportunity in that i 'd like to demonstrate what i mean by this by telling the which is a technology which has done all of these the dvd as you know was introduced in the but you can see that by one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight it had fallen below four hundred dollars and four hundred dollars was a psychological threshold it started to take off and you can see that the the units started to trend up the hidden inflection point it was taking off the next thing it hit a year later twenty percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household and what 's interesting here is that something else took off along with it suddenly you have a dvd in the house you 've got high quality digital video you have a reason to have a big screen television you have a reason for dolby five point one surround sound and bring the rest of your entertainment in what 's interesting also is note that netflix was founded in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine reed hastings he clearly saw that that was a moment that was an inflection point that he could do something with you can see the implications in the world at large netflix was right the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that among the dvd 's many assets is that it 's very small you can stick it in the mailer there 's a company called apex a no name chinese firm who several times in the past year been the number one the premium brands the sonys and it 's a tough market out there now they 've introduced these four these four ways of looking at technology these four stages of technology 's life i 'd like to talk about some other technologies out there just technologies on our radar and i 'll use this lens these four as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its top 10 technologies out there they 're just examples of technologies that are in each each one of these but i think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers these intersections are interesting to think about start with gene sequencing in a large part because it 's built on computers is falling in price at a kind of a moore 's if craig venter indeed comes today he may tell you something about this our ability to to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer what 's interesting is that at the same time the number of genes that we 're discovering rising very quickly each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test there will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done very cheaply if you want to know you can learn about your own mosaic here 's another technology that that 's approaching a critical price this is a fascinating research drug compounds and cocktails today it 's less than fifty cents a day what 's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity if you look at the and the clinton foundation and who and the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that linux is another good example but you can look and see the direction those lines are going you can see that at the twenty now taken seriously it 's not just for for the geeks any more that is i imagine what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about and if you look at the trends here by about two thousand and eight and i don 't think this is a crazy forecast they 'll be two percent of auto sales two percent isn 't twenty percent but in the car business which is slow moving that 's huge and what 's interesting about you can change the structure you can have regenerative braking you can have drive by wire you can have replaceable body shapes it 's a little thing that starts with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car voice over ip is something you may have heard something about again it 's kind of coming out of nowhere it 's a little hard to use right now there 's a company created by the kazaa founders they already have nearly four million registered users you 're looking at ip taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards this is a tipping point forgive me and the players in the industry it 's going to look a little bit like that because the reproduction because it 's such an efficient protocol it comes with fiber optics because there 's so much bandwidth free is it 's a technical force it 's a deflationary force if not handled right it is abundance as opposed to scarcity free is probably the most interesting thing and here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on on a hard drive you know there could be a film 's [ unclear ] there but it 's basically every song ever made could be stored on four hundred dollars worth of storage it takes and and hollywood 's worried as well they 're facing a force and their response is draconian and not necessarily the the one that 's going to get them out of this and finally i 'll give you one last last example of free perhaps the most powerful of all i mentioned fiber optics and what 's interesting is that it was just one thousand nine hundred and ninety when it was more than two dollars a minute india had still has a regulated phone system and so and so did we it was you couldn couldn 't hold back and look how quickly the price"
