  "transcript": "there is great confusion when the two look at each other art of course looks at the world through the emotions the unconscious at times and of course the aesthetic science the quantitative things that can be measured and described but it gives art a terrific context of understanding in the extreme ice survey we 're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity 's relationship with nature better i as a person who 's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life video film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape the way we think about nature and about ourselves i 'm fascinated by the beauty of it the mutability of it the malleability of it and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself these first images are from greenland but ice has another meaning ice is the canary in the global coal mine it 's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less is it getting hotter or is it getting colder what do the computer models say about this that and the other thing all of that strip the changes are happening they 're very visible they 're photographable they 're measurable there is no significant scientific dispute about that it 's bomb proof information and the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that science is not arguing about that turning into global sea i was still a skeptic about climate change until about ten years ago because i thought the story of climate change was based on computer models i hadn 't realized it was based on concrete measurements of what the tree rings and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature when i realized that climate change was real and it was not based on computer models i decided that one day i would i would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically and that led me to this i was working on a national geographic assignment conventional single frame still photography and one crazy day i got the idea that i should after that assignment was finished i got the idea that i should shoot in time lapse photography that i should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every fifteen minutes or every hour or whatever and watch the progression of the landscape over time well within about three incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time lapse cameras into cameras and the next six months of my life were the hardest build and deploy out in the field these twenty five time lapse cameras they are powered by the sun there is a custom made computer that tells the bedrock positions and they watch the evolution of the landscape we just had a number of cameras out on the greenland ice sheet we actually drilled holes into the ice way deep down below the thawing level and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so actually there 's still a camera out there right now in any case here 's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made bolt and washer in these crazy things i spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally we 're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere it 's a big undertaking i stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team there 's a lot of people working on this right now we 've got thirty three cameras out this moment we just had thirty three cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere watching what 's happened and we 've spent a lot of time in the field it 's been a fantastic amount of work we 've been out for two and a half years and we 've got about another two and a half years yet to go that 's only half our job the other half of our job is to tell the story to the global scientists have collected this kind of information similarly a lot of art projects stay in the art community and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like ted and like our relationship with the obama white house with the senate with john we 've done films we 've done books we have more coming we have a site on google earth and so forth because we feel very much the need to tell this story because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now now one bit of science before we get into the visuals if everybody in the developed world and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time several things are important number one temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync you can see that from the orange line and the blue line that 's the natural cycle but two we are way way outside the normal natural variability in the past hundred years the temperature of the earth has gone up one point three degrees fahrenheit 75 degrees it 's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere steady increase we have to turn that around and someday i hope to emblazon that across times square in new york and a lot of other places but anyway this is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months you see the glacier flowing in from the right if you look in the in the middle background you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo yo that means that glacier 's floating and it 's unstable and you 're about to see the consequences of that floating to give you that calving face in this picture is about but in fact it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet so there 's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if if the glacier 's grounded on bedrock and floating if it isn 't here that 's the retreat the main stem the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right and and we expect that it 's probably retreated another half a mile but if i if i got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back i wouldn 't be the least bit surprised now it 's really hard to grasp the scale of these places because as the glaciers one of the things is that places like alaska and greenland are huge they 're not normal landscapes they 're also deflating like air is being let out of a balloon and so there are features on this landscape there 's a ridge right in the middle of the picture up above where that arrow comes in that shows you that a little bit there 's a marker line called the trim line above our little red illustration there this is something no self respecting photographer would ever do you put some cheesy illustration on your shot right and but in any case the deflation of this glacier since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four has been higher than the eiffel tower higher than the empire state building a tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it 's retreated and deflated gone back up valley particularly in the world of sea ice the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago and the processes there are big big changes happening as we speak and everybody says well don 't they advance in the winter time no it was retreating through the winter because it 's an unhealthy glacier finally catches up to itself it advances you can look at these pictures over and over again because there 's such a strange bizarre fascination in seeing these things you don 't normally get to see come alive we 've been talking about seeing is believing and seeing the unseen at the images make the huge crevasses open up these great ice islands break off and now watch this this has been the springtime this year a huge collapse that happened in about a month the loss of all that ice so that 's where we started three years ago way out on the left and that 's where we were a few months ago the last time we went into columbia to give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat we did another cheesy illustration that 's about how far back that was the slheimajkull you can see it deflating you can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this but the camera records it so we wind time backwards now that 's where it started that 's where it ended a few months ago and on up to greenland the faster it responds to climate greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past and there 's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there it 's a that 's all ice all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle the one glacier up in greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the we have some cameras on the south quickly dwarfed the calving face is four and a half miles across and in this shot as we pull back you 're only seeing about a mile and a half so imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out the interior of greenland is to the right it 's flowing out to the atlantic ocean on the left we just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago as you can see june 25th monster calving events happened i 'll show you one of those in a second this glacier has doubled its flow speed dumping all this ice into the ocean we had a team this is what a couple of the cameras saw icebergs rolling over how big was that it 's hard to get it an illustration again gives you a feeling for scale a the block was three fifths of a mile deep and if you compare the expanse of the calving face to the tower bridge in london about twenty bridges wide or if you take an american reference to the u s capitol building and you pack three thousand capitol buildings into that block it would be equivalent to how large that block was seventy five minutes now i 've come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world we have a problem of perception the policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough but we actually can deal with them i 'm certain that we can but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet you 're an elite audience you get it and that 's where i think organizations like ted like the extreme ice survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along because i believe we have an opportunity but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and in fact of our century thank you"
