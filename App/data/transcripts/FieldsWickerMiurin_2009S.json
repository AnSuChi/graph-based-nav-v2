  "transcript": "i 'm going to talk about these are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science they 're discoveries of people and the way people are and new leadership this is benki benki is a leader of the ashaninka nation his people live in brazil and in peru benki comes from a village so remote or go by canoe for several days i met benki three years ago in sao paulo when i 'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples because we wanted to learn from each other we wanted to share our stories with each other the ashaninka people are known throughout south america starting with the incas 19th century with the rubber today 's biggest threat to the ashaninka people and to benki comes from illegal logging the float them down the river to world markets benki knew this he could see what was happening to his forest to his environment because he was taken under his grandfather 's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people his grandfather died when he was only ten now in the ashaninka tradition this is the person who contains within him all the knowledge all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life and not just about his people but about everything that his people 's survival depended on the soil the forest so when he was only ten and he became the paje he began to lead his people he began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect the way of life they needed to nurture he explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive and to protect that eight years later when he was a young man of eighteen benki left the forest for the first time he went three thousand miles on an odyssey to rio to the earth summit but if you can imagine this young man with his headdress and his flowing robe learning a new language portuguese not to mention english going to rio but he wasn 't dismayed benki came back to his village full of ideas new technologies new research new ways of understanding what was going on since that time he 's continued to work with his people and not only the ashaninka nation and he 's brought the and satellite technology to the forest both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world why are you putting yourself at risk why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world he would tell what did my grandparents and my do to protect the forest for me and what am i doing so when i think of that i wonder what our grandchildren and our i wonder how they will answer for me the world is veering towards a future we don 't much want when we really think about it deep inside it 's a future we don 't know the details of but it 's a future that has signs just like benki saw the signs around him we 're running out of land we know climate change is and we also know that the world has changed in other ways that since one thousand nine hundred and as many new countries that exist as independent entities on the planet egos systems of government figuring it out massive change and in addition to that we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future a say we haven 't even really started to hear yet china india south africa where benki got his civil rights only in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight constitution but you know all that you know more than benki knew when he left his forest and went three thousand miles you also know that we can 't just keep doing what we 've always done because we 'll get the results we 've always gotten and this reminds me of something i understand lord salisbury said to queen victoria things are bad enough as they are that we need to change ourselves we need new models of what it means to be a leader we need new models now i don 't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends where i 've had the real privilege of meeting people like benki and many others who are making change happen in their communities who understand the filters that they wear i met sanghamitra eight years ago when i was in bangalore organizing a workshop with leaders of different ngo 's working in some of the hardest aspects of society but she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that she loved it but she was too detached she decided to start a new organization called samraksha focused on one of the hardest areas one of the hardest issues in india anywhere in the world at the time since that time samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health ngo but if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of hiv aids in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three in india at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why and everyone was actually very very afraid today there are still three million when i asked sanghamitra how did you get from english literature to hiv aids literature makes one sensitive sensitive to people to their dreams samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to hiv they have respite homes the first the first care centers the first counseling services and not just in urban ten of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government people today she works with people like murali krishna and he 's hiv positive the care the compassion that sanghamitra and her team brought to the village and he wanted to be part of it he 's a leaders ' quest fellow and that helps him with his work they 've pioneered a different and she had a real they were sitting in a circle talking about the dreams for the village and the young women in the village spoke up and said we 've changed our dream our dream but to be given to us because they 've been tested for hiv if you are lucky enough to meet sanghamitra and ask her why and how how have you achieved so much she would look at you and very quietly very softly say it just happened it 's the spirit inside this is dr fan jianchuan jianchuan comes from sichuan province in he 's been a soldier a teacher and what do you do he would tell you and i curate a museum i was lucky i had heard about him for years and i finally met him earlier this year at his museum starting when he was four or five in the early one thousand nine hundred and sixty 's now just think of the early one thousand nine hundred and sixty 's in china he 's kept collecting so that he now has over eight million pieces these are pieces that you won 't find anywhere else in the world in part because they document parts of history chinese choose to forget sino japanese war a war that 's not talked about in china very much and whose heroes are not honored why did he do all this because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past so from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues of the heroes of the sino japanese war including those chinese who then fought with each other and left mainland china to go to taiwan to commemorating he is making sure one man but it 's not just chinese heroes he cares about this building contains the world 's largest collection of documents and artifacts in fighting on the chinese side in that long war he has nine other buildings that are already open to the public filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary chinese history two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the cultural revolution a period that actually most chinese would prefer to forget but he doesn 't want his nation ever and they inspire me because they show us what is possible change the way you look at your place they didn 't go to business school they didn they have drive passion commitment and they 've gone to something they didn 't know they 've tried to connect worlds and they 've they have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it they know people have come before them and will follow them and they know that they 're part of a whole that they depend on other people they know that but it has to start with them and they have humility and we know the direction the world is going in so i think we need we can 't wait for the next generation the new joiners to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need i think it has to start with us and we know just like they knew how hard it we can change we can change the way will answer benki 's question thank you"
