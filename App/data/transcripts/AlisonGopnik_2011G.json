  "transcript": "illogical egocentric that he couldn 't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect let me give you just one example of this one thing that this baby could be thinking about that could be going on in his mind is trying to figure out what 's going on in the mind of that other baby after all one of the things and maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn 't actually exactly like what we think and feel anyone who 's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people now the question is how could we ask them and if you ask a three year old to tell you what he thinks what you 'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that what we did betty rapacholi who was one of my students and i was actually to give the babies two now all of the babies even in berkley like the crackers and don 't like the raw broccoli and she would act as if she liked it or she didn 't so half the time she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn 't like but half the time what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go mmmmm broccoli i tasted the broccoli mmmmm and then she would take a little bit of the crackers and she 'd go eww yuck i tasted as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted we did this with fifteen and eighteen month old babies and then she would simply put her hand out and say can you give me some so the question is what would the baby give her what they liked or what she liked but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli on the other hand fifteen month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli like they couldn 't figure this out what they thought everybody must like so there are two really remarkable things about this the first one is that these little eighteen month old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature that we don 't always month olds didn 't do this suggests that these eighteen month olds had learned this deep profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were fifteen months old and this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last twenty years that 's actually demonstrated it the question you might ask though is why do children learn so much and how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time i mean after all if you look at babies superficially they seem pretty useless and actually in many ways they 're worse than useless because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive but if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats it turns out that there 's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are ravens rooks and so are incredibly smart birds they 're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects and this is a bird on the cover of science who 's learned how to use a tool to get food so they 're very they depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months so childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens end up in the soup pot there 's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to well what kind of so they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment and of course we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal we 're smarter we 're more flexible we can learn more we survive in more different environments we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space and at least until they 're twenty three we 're still popping those worms into those little open mouths all but it has one big disadvantage and that one big disadvantage is that until you so you don 't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself a slingshot or maybe a spear might work which would actually be better you want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up we don 't have to do anything all we have to do is learn and we 're production and marketing we to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species kind of like caterpillars and butterflies except that they 're actually the brilliant if this is true if these babies are designed to learn and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning that 's what they 're for but real computers are actually getting to be a lot and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize so what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with they go out and test it against the evidence and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that and that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now so if i think it actually looks something like this this is reverend bayes 's notebook so i think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they 're revising to figure out how the world works all if you ask even grownups about statistics they look extremely stupid how could it be that children are doing statistics so to test this we used a machine that we have called the blicket detector this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others and using this very simple machine let me mention just one that we did with tumar kushner my student because if you wave a block over the top of the detector something you wouldn 't ever think of to begin with if you do the likely thing put the block on the detector it will only activate two out of six times so we did just this the four and the other interesting thing is that they 're using that evidence to get to an idea get to a hypothesis about the world that seems very unlikely to begin with year olds are actually and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments when children do experiments we call it getting into there 's been a bunch of interesting and what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn and what you 'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes now this is his next idea he told the experimenter not working either particularly adorable but what cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical if you look at the way children play when you ask them to explain something what they really do is do a series of experiments this is actually pretty typical of four year olds well if you go back to those psychologists and so what happens for adults is we decide that something 's and everything else sort of goes dark and we even know something about the way the brain does this so what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex the sort of executive part of our brains sends a signal that makes a so we have a if we look at babies and young children we see something very different i think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness so babies and young children are very bad and if you actually look in their brains you see that they 're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at that 's the kind of attention the kind of consciousness that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to i think the best thing is think about cases where we 're put in a new situation that we 've never been in before when we fall in love with someone new or when we 're in a new city for the first time so what 's it like to be a baby it 's like being in love in paris for the first time after you 've had fantastic way to be but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o 'clock in the morning and it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into babies think like adults do but if what we want is to be like those butterflies to have imagination creativity innovation maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children"
