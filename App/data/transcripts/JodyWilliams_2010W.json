  "transcript": "to make a challenge to people i know there have been many challenges made to people the one i 'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace is not i do not think about what i consider to be peace which is sustainable peace with justice and equality it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives where these people have enough access to education and health care so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear and i am not a complete pacifist like some of my really really i understand that humans are so messed up to use it is not arming our country to i was thinking about the recent ongoings in congress where i certainly support the start vote but he 's offering eighty four billion dollars for the for the modernizing of nuclear weapons do you know the figure that the u n talks about for fulfilling the millennium development goals is eighty billion dollars just that little bit of money which to me i wish it was in my bank account it 's not but it 's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime unless we get up off our and take action to make it happen unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we 've been hearing about in these last two days it is it is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have i was in hiroshima a couple of weeks ago and his holiness we 're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city and there were about eight of us nobel laureates and he 's a bad guy he 's like a bad kid in church we 're staring at everybody waiting our turn to speak and he leans over to me and he says jody i 'm a buddhist monk your robe gives it away he said you know that i kind of like meditation and i pray i said i don 't follow that but that 's cool i do not believe that meditation i spoke with aung sun suu kyi a couple of days ago as most of you know 's a hero for democracy in her country burma you probably also know that she has spent fifteen of the last twenty years imprisoned she is already out in the streets working with the party to try to rebuild it but i talked to her for a range of issues but one thing that i want to say because it 's but i don 't believe in hope unless we take action to make it so here 's another woman hero of mine she 's my friend she has been in exile for the last year and a half you ask her and instead of going home she conferred with all the other women that she works with who said to her stay out we need you out we need to be able to talk to you out there so that you can give the message of what 's happening here a year and a half she 's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country wangari maathai working for peace is very creative when she was planting those trees i don 't think most people understand that at the same she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country but if they were together planting trees for the environment it was okay but it 's not just iconic women like shirin like aung sun suu kyi like wangari maathai it is other women in the world who are also struggling together eleven individual organizations of burmese women came together because there 's strength in numbers working together is what changes our world the million signatures campaign of women inside burma mairead mcguire in the middle betty the quick story an ira driver was shot and his car plowed into people on the side of the street there was a mother and three children the children were killed on the spot it was mairead 's sister instead of giving in to grief depression defeat in the face of that violence hooked up with betty a staunch protestant and a staunch catholic and they took to the streets to say no more violence and they were able to get tens of thousands of primarily women some men in the streets and they have been part of what brought peace to northern ireland and they 're still working on it because there 's still a lot more to do this is rigoberta she is now running for president she is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy about how you bring democracy to the country about educating about how to vote but that democracy is not just about voting it 's about being an active citizen one of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two ngos some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month they could maybe volunteer that much there were others like myself who were actions together of all of us that brought about that change it and if each of us who cares about the different things we care about we would save this world and we can 't wait for the other guy we have to do it ourselves thank you"
