  "transcript": "because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people and i thought that since i was among friends here i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing so if you can just turn on the this is just a random slide that i i picked out of my file what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide but the general form of it this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area networks and the interesting thing about it is that this slide like so many technology slides that we 're used to is a sort of a straight and this is a new thing that we talk about technology and that 's basically what i 'm going to be talking about so if you could bring up the bring up the lights higher because i 'm just going to use a piece of paper here now why do we draw technology curves in semi log curves well the answer is if i drew it on a normal curve and this is whatever measure of the technology that that i 'm trying to they sort of go like this and now some other technology say transportation technology on a semi log curve it would look very stupid it would look like a flat line but so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology the day after tomorrow i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in thirty seconds now the question that i 'd like to ask they don 't go on forever things just can 't possibly keep changing s curve until something totally different comes along or maybe it 's going to do this now i 'm an optimist so i sort of think it 's probably going to do something like that if so that means that what we 're in the middle of right now is a transition we 're sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is and so what i 'm trying to ask what i 've been asking myself is what 's this new way that the world is what 's that new state that the world is the transition seems very very confusing when we 're right in the middle of it now when i was a kid growing up the future was kind of the year two thousand and people used to talk about what would happen in the year two thousand and you notice that the future is still at about the year two thousand it 's about as far as we go so in other words the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something 's happening there that transition is happening we can all sense it and we know that it just doesn 't make too much sense to think out thirty fifty years because everything 's going to be so different that a simple now in order to do that i 'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things so the time scale that i would like to look at this on the time scale of of life on earth so i think this the earth was this big sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it which is that at that time there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them but now those drops of oil weren 't really alive as we say it now because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them and so every drop was a little bit different in fact the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them now that 's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life things got interesting somehow by ways that we don 't quite understand these little drops learned to write down information they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical so in other words they worked out in this mindless sort of evolutionary way in fact every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and in fact one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code and i 've got here a little one hundred micrograms of white powder which i try not to let the security people see at airports but this has in it what i did is i took this code and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and it 's right here i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different which is these i don 't know if you know this but bacteria can actually exchange dna now and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate now what this communication allowed was communities to form that in some sense were in the same boat together they were synergistic so they survived or they failed together which means that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that in fact they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of dna and so the next stage that 's interesting in life took about another billion years and working together lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell muscle cell a brain cell and so on now the next step that happened is within these communities again began to abstract information and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community and those are the neural structures so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up and in fact they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording understanding learning information and that was the brains and the nervous system and that gave them an evolutionary advantage because at that point an individual so an organism could for instance learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate whereas before they 'd built these special information processing structures that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over so that nervous system the fact that they built these special information structures up the whole process of evolution because evolution could now happen within an individual it could happen in learning time scales but and for example the most sophisticated version that we 're aware of is human language it 's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it here i have a very complicated messy so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism what we 've done is we humanity have started abstracting out we 're going through the same levels that multi cellular organisms have gone through so for example the invention of language was a tiny step in that and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than than what we were before so now evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds and you saw ty 's little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution then the next and these next steps like electronics seem to be taking only a few decades the process is feeding on itself and becoming autocatalytic is the word for it when something reinforces its rate of change the more it changes the faster it changes and i think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve we 're seeing this process feeding back on itself and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers so right now what i do is i design objects at such complexity there are billions i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it and in fact sometimes it takes it by methods that we don 't quite even understand one method so what we do is we put inside the machine we can actually evolve a program say computer would you please make a hundred million random sequences of now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions run all of those programs and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted so in other words i define what i wanted let 's say i want to sort numbers as a simple example i 've done it with so none of them will really do it but one of them by luck may put two numbers in the right order say computer and now let 's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best and let 's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the and try that again and do that for another generation so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes or in the complicated cases in a few hours at the end of that i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers and in fact i know in fact their life depended on doing the job laughter i was riding in a seven hundred and forty seven with marvin minsky once and he pulls out this card and says oh look look at this it says ' this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight ' doesn 't that make you feel confident in fact we know that the engineering process doesn 't work very well when it gets complicated so we 're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that 's very different and yet we don 't quite understand the options of it so in a sense it 's getting ahead of us we 're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we 'll be able to run this process much faster so it 's feeding back on itself the thing is becoming faster and that 's why i think it seems so confusing because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves we 're taking off and what we are is we 're at a point in time which is analogous to when single celled organisms were turning into multi celled organisms so we but i think that there really is something coming along after us i think it 's very haughty of us to think that we 're the end product of evolution i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is and i think i will stop at that point before i get selected out"
