  "transcript": "thirteen years one three thirteen years i 've been part of an exceptional team at insightec in israel and partners around the world for taking this idea this concept noninvasive surgery from the research lab to routine clinical use and this is what i 'll tell you about thirteen years for some of you you can empathize with that number for me today on this date it 's like a second bar mitzvah experience laughter so this this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies one is the focused ultrasound and the other one is the and i hold in my hand a tissue mimicking phantom it is made out of silicon it is transparent made just for you so you see it 's all so the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom this is when the energy starts to emit and you see so everything around it so this is i think right ultrasound imaging and you know also about lithotripsy breaking but ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between because it 's a mechanical the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush and i am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all when i was born this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the fry brothers but you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain noninvasively with focused and there was something fundamental that they were missing they were missing the vision it wasn 't until the invention of the mr and really the integration of ultrasound that we could get the feedback both the anatomical and the physiological closed loop surgical procedure this is an mr suite one of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders like parkinson 's or essential tremor what is typical to those conditions to essential tremor for example is inability to drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything over you or write legibly so people can understand it and be really independent in your life so i 'd like you to meet john so he suffered from essential tremor for many years he it is approved under the university of virginia in charlottesville using focused ultrasound this is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the mr so now i 'll take you through [ what ] a typical procedure like that looks like [ what ] looks like so we put the patient on the mr table we attach a transducer in this case to the brain but if it will be a different organ it will be a different transducer attached to the patient and the physician will then take and the objective of that i don 't have a pointer here but you see the so once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on and it does this burst of energy it elevates the temperature we first need to verify that but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees and one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the mr this is really a unique but here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time and you can see the points there on the graph so once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen then we move to perform and you see the temperature rises to like fifty five to sixty degrees c if you do it for more than a second it 's enough to basically this is the outcome and you have to understand what is in people 's mind when when they are willing to take the risk this is a quote from john after he wrote it he said miraculous and his wife said this is the happiest moment of my life and you wonder why i mean one of the messages i like to carry over is what about defending quality of life i mean those people lose their independence they are dependent on and he also plays golf like you do in in virginia when you are so you can see here the spot it 's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain there 's no damage outside he suffers from no neurodeficit there 's no recovery needed no nothing to his normal life let 's move now and people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain lower back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases when the get to your bones sometimes they are very painful all those i 've indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by focused ultrasound relieving the pain again very fast and i would like to tell you about he 's a who suffered from how should i say it it 's called pain in the butt he had metastases in his right buttock he had to forgo all the farm activities he was but it didn 't help many patients like that favor radiation therapy and again he volunteered to a pivotal study that we ran worldwide also in the u s and he had to sit and on the way and you have to understand what those people feel and what their family he rides his horse to their mountain cabin and and it has been shown actually outside of the u s and doing that in the u s is very painful i don 't see without this nation taking it as it will not happen and it 's not just because of regulation because of the amount of money needed under the current medicine and the size of trials and so on and but i have a message for the men here we heard here yesterday quyen talking about the adverse event trait in prostate cancer there is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by mr because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland and by that avoiding all the issues well there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen quite lethal very lethal actually pancreas liver kidney the challenge there with a breathing and awake patient and in all our treatments the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician and and this is in two thousand and women suffer from that disease all those tumors have so she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in two thousand and eight so new life was like to leave you with with actually four messages one is think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large and i think also from their physicians by the way and the other thing i would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient the patient holds a stop sonication button he can stop the surgery at any moment and with that note i would like to thank you for listening"
