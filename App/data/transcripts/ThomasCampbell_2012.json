  "transcript": "a career in the art world i took a course in london and one of my supervisors was this irascible italian called and he put up an image of a painting it was a landscape and he said what is this and i said it 's a bacchanal by titian he said it 's a what i thought maybe i 'd pronounced it as i said he swore too much there was an important lesson for me in that pietro was suspicious of formal art training art history training because he feared and he was especially evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight and these were important lessons to me when i subsequently became a professional art historian my kind of eureka moment came a a few years and of course it was very much but as i began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions i found there was a kind of a missing component for everywhere i came across descriptions of tapestries tapestries were ubiquitous and it was pretty apparent why tapestries were portable dank interior into a richly colored setting provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated and in addition to that tapestries were hugely expensive they required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials the wools the silks even gold and silver thread so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda well i became because i saw the met as one of the few places where i could organize really big exhibitions about the subject i cared so passionately about and in about one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the then director philippe de montebello it 's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car some of them are so big we had to get them into the museum we had to take them up the great steps at the front the labeling you know we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs a one hit image these were big complex things we had to draw our audience in get them to slow down to explore the objects there was a lot of skepticism on the opening night i overheard one of the senior members of staff saying this is going to be a bomb hundreds of thousands of people and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs so i want you to use your imaginations thinking of these violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism they kind of you know they were little boys and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground kind of an in your face joke by the and that it was the same for our audience and i felt i 'd shifted the needle a little through this experience that could only be created in a museum i 'd opened up the eyes of my audience artists press the general public to the beauty of this of this lost medium i don 't wear a i believe passionately but there 's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well told narrative the interpretation of a complex esoteric subject whether it 's an exhibition renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier the mcqueen show with which we enjoyed so much success last summer that was an interesting case in the late spring early summer of of two thousand and ten shortly after mcqueen and said i 've been thinking of doing a show on mcqueen and now is the moment we have to we have to do it fast it wasn 't easy mcqueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy it wasn 't just your standard installation in fact we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings a recreation of his first studio a hall of mirrors a curiosity box a sunken ship a burned out interior with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating and in this it could have looked like but because of the way that andrew connected with the mcqueen team he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of mcqueen and the show was quite transcendant and a phenomenon in its own right i heard over and over again wow that was worth it it was a such a visceral emotive experience now i 've described two very immersive exhibitions but i also believe that individual objects can also have that same power and because of it 's in our galleries that we can unpack the the civilizations the cultures it 's in our galleries that we can explain knowledge of the and then it was thrust upon us in one of america 's darkest hours and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event now now in our galleries we show fourteen centuries of the development of different islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread i 'm often asked i 'm a huge advocate of the web but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people but who like and i think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves helps us make better decisions about where we 're going face to face with a dog pooping in the"
