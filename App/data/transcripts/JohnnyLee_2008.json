  "transcript": "and this is essential to the progress of science or exploration of what is possible it creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology something that motivates me and gets me really excited about my research is when i see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population and they actually use the nintendo wii remote for those of you who aren 't familiar with this device it 's a $ forty and i 'm going to show you two demos of why this is so here i have my computer set up with the projector and i have a wii remote sitting on top of it and for example normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars so i 'm going to show you how to create one with a wii remote now this requires another piece which is this infrared pen you can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the radio shack it 's got a battery a button and an infrared you guys can 't see it but it turns on whenever i push the button now what this means is that if i run this piece of software and i can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels and now this is like an interactive whiteboard surface applause so for about $ fifty of hardware you can have your own whiteboard this is adobe photoshop thank you the software for this i 've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free in the three months this project has been public it 's been downloaded over half a million so teachers and students all around the world are already using this applause although it does do it for fifty dollars there are some limitations of this approach you get about eighty percent of the way there for one percent of the another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots so this is actually a multi touch interactive whiteboard system as well rather than and why why this is interesting is that if you put on say a pair of safety glasses that have two infrared dots in them they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location and why this is interesting is i have this sort of application running on the computer monitor which has a 3d room with some targets floating in it and you can see that it looks like a like a video game it sort of looks 3d but for the most part the image looks pretty flat and bound to the surface of the screen but if we turn turn on head tracking the can change the image that 's on the screen and make it respond to the head movements so let 's switch back to that so this has actually been a little bit startling to the game development community laughter because this is about ten dollars of additional hardware if you already have a so i 'm looking forward to seeing some games and actually louis castle that 's him down there last week announced that electronic arts one of the largest game publishers is releasing a game in may that has a little easter egg feature for supporting this type of head tracking and that 's from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product youtube has really changed the way or changed the speed in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world i 'm doing some research in my lab with a and within the first week a million people had seen this work and engineers teachers and students from around the world were already posting their own youtube videos of so thank you very much"
