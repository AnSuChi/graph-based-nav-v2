  "transcript": "about a year ago i asked myself a question knowing what i know why am i not a vegetarian i grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin i started a site called treehugger i knew that the ten billion animals we raise each year for meat wouldn 't even consider for our own cats environmentally cars trains planes buses boats all of it i also knew that i 'm not alone we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s so really any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian yet so why was i stalling imagine your last hamburger laughter so my common sense my good intentions and i 'd commit to doing it later the name says it all on the weekend your choice simple been after all if all of us ate half as much meat it would be like half of us were vegetarians"
