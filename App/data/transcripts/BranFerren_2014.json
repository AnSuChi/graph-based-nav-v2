  "transcript": "good morning that one moment one moment profoundly affected how i think about art design and engineering as background i was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world 's great cities my dad john ferren who died when i was fifteen he was one of the new york school abstract expressionists who together with his contemporaries invented american modern art and contributed to moving the american zeitgeist towards modernism in the 20th century yet now pervasive as with many other important innovations those radical ideas required no new technology just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment plus resiliency in the face of it was like oxygen around us and necessary for life as i watched him paint dad taught me that art was not i followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy i had no interest in what i did love was electronics and machines what they all had in common was they worked very very hard my grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in brooklyn which was new york city 's radio row there we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics and for a few bucks bring home treasures like norden bombsights and parts from the first i learned about engineering and how apparently avoiding electrocution we visited the great museums and historic buildings of both europe and the middle east they would simply drop me off in places like the london science museum where i would wander endlessly for hours by myself then when i was about nine years old we went to rome drum shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting it didn 't look all that special from the outside as i said but when we walked inside i was immediately struck by three things first of all it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside i didn 't know why that just felt special i looked up at the heavens through the oculus this was the first church that i 'd been to that provided an i looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor as i became more accustomed to the dark i was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls no big deal here just the same statuary stuff that we 'd seen all over rome in fact it looked like the appian way marble salesman showed up with his sample book showed it to hadrian and hadrian said we 'll take all of it but the ceiling was amazing it looked like a buckminster fuller geodesic dome i 'd seen these before and bucky was friends with my dad it was modern high tech impressive a huge clear span which not coincidentally was exactly its height it was really beautiful and unlike anything i 'd ever seen before so i asked my dad when was this built he said about two thousand years ago and i said he said it 's the original roof that moment changed my life and i can remember it as if it were yesterday for the first time i realized people were smart two thousand years ago i mean and sure they 're impressive nice enough design but look give me an unlimited budget twenty thousand to forty thousand laborers it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that 's ever been built by miracles i mean things that are technically barely possible very high risk and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time certainly not by you for example here are some of the pantheon 's miracles they had to invent super strong concrete and to control weight varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome each of diminishing size which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design it was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass natural convection of air rising up through the oculus and a venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building i discovered for the first time that light itself has substance the shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable and i realized they were all kind of irrelevant without it because without light you can 't see any of them i also realized that i wasn 't the first person to think that this place was really special largely because of that visit i came to understand that contrary to what i was being told in school i realized when combined you could create things that were amazing that couldn 't be done in either domain alone but in school with few exceptions they were treated as separate worlds and they still are urging me to specialize only caused me to really appreciate those polymaths like they also needed the storytelling and leadership skills necessary to fund and execute it it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles the problem is no matter how talented rich or smart you are you whatever remember most people can 't even imagine one of these technical miracles and you need at least five to make a pantheon in my experience these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of they summon the courage and determination to deliver the remaining miracles and they often take what other people think to be insurmountable obstacles and turn them into features take the oculus of the pantheon by insisting that it be in the design it meant you couldn 't use much by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution they came up with a design that only works if there 's a big hole in the roof that done you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of and that critical direct connection with the heavens not bad these people not only believed that the impossible can be done but that it must be done enough ancient history what are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now well putting a man on the moon was a good one and returning him safely to earth wasn 't bad either so what came after the moon one is tempted to say that today 's pantheon is the internet i actually think that 's quite wrong or at least it 's only part of the story it 's more like the invention of concrete just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the new designers will use the technologies of the internet to create novel concepts that will endure the such as curing because are anchored in designed physical objects ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them and will continue to do so indefinitely these other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are of course critical and fantastic perhaps counterintuitively i 'm guessing it 's a visionary idea from the late that 's been revived every decade since autonomous vehicles now you 're thinking give me a break how can a fancy version of cruise control be profound much of our world has been designed around roads and transportation these were as essential to the success of the roman empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the united states today these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for one hundred years each year these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the united states alone and a million globally much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear they will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities work and the way we live we will get where we 're going faster and society will recapture universities and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it autonomy could be done now so what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles you need to know where all the roads are what the rules are and where you 're going you must have near continuous communication with high performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent the wireless technologies developed for mobile devices with some minor modifications are completely suitable to solve this probably want some restricted roadways to get started that both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this this will start with the hov lanes and move from there you need to recognize people signs and objects machine vision special sensors and high performance computing can do occasionally humans will need to do sense making for this you might actually have to wake up your passenger and ask them what the hell that big lump is in the middle of the road not so bad and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant every other car on the surface of the earth will know that from that point on five miracles mostly delivered and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful and new and i predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades pantheons are all around us just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge multidisciplinary skills and intense passion to harness them to make we need to help them and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums we need to encourage them to find their own path even if it 's very different from our own take them out into the sunlight so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world our planet and our civilization we also need they are in fact essential to what makes us special perhaps you can take your kids to the actual pantheon"
