  "transcript": "birds are very agile they fly not with rotating components so they fly only by flapping their and it must have excellent and indoor flying model that no one would be hurt if it and we 'd like to learn more about pneumatics and your seat belts on and put your and it is all out of carbon and we use the gear to transfer so within the motor we have three hall sensors so we know exactly where the wing is so if you go down you have the large area of propulsion and if you go up and it is easier to get up we get the lift and we get the propulsion at the lower wing also we see how we measure so therefore it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion from thirty percent up to eighty percent so the overall consumption of energy is about"
