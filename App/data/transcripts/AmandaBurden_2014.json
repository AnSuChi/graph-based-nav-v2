  "transcript": "but when i think about cities i think about so even more important than buildings in a city so but what makes a public space work i could make a huge contribution to my city and i use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces one of the first spaces that i studied was this little vest pocket park called paley park in midtown manhattan this little space became a small phenomenon it made an enormous impression on me so i knew that places like paley park didn 't happen but what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it movable chairs move and then interestingly people themselves attracted other people but my question was why weren 't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn 't feel alone unfortunately that 's not how cities were being designed so here you see a familiar sight they have that stylish spartan look that we often associate i mean where would you sit here but they might tolerate a sculpture but that 's about it and for developers they are ideal there 's nothing to water nothing to maintain and no undesirable people to worry about but don 't you think this is a waste i wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling that you got in paley park and not developers to build bleak plazas like this especially in a city like new york where public space has open spaces in cities are opportunities yes they are opportunities for commercial investment but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city and therein lies the conflict the first opportunity i had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s when i was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called battery park city in lower manhattan on the hudson river almost insane idea instead of building a park as a complement to future development why don 't we reverse that equation and build a small but very high quality public open space first and see if that made a difference so we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade so whatever we built had to be perfect and when i sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me so you see but design is not just how something looks it 's how your body feels on that seat and i believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience but that granite edge the trees in planting and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be now this proved very valuable twenty years later when michael bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of new york he said to me on that very day he said that new york was projected to grow from eight to nine million people and he asked me so where are you going to put one million additional new yorkers i didn 't have any idea you know that new york does place a high value on attracting immigrants so we were excited about the prospect of growth but where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water where could new housing go and what about cars our city couldn 't possibly handle any more cars what were we going to do if we couldn 't spread out we had to go up so that meant using one of our greatest assets but we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it if we were to and so here was the plan what we really needed to do we needed to redo our zoning targeting where new development could go and prohibiting any development at all in our ambitious so how was i going to get this done by listening thousands of hours of listening and so i began walking i can 't tell you how many blocks i walked in sweltering summers in freezing winters year after year just so i could get to understand the dna of each neighborhood and know what so little by little neighborhood by neighborhood block by block we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit over the course of twelve years we were able to rezone thousand five hundred blocks so that now ninety percent of all new development of new york is within a 10 minute walk of a subway nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car but rezoning was never my mission so in the areas where we zoned for significant development i was determined to create places that would make a difference in people 's here you see what was two miles of abandoned degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of greenpoint and williamsburg in brooklyn impossible to get to and impossible to use so i felt an obligation i wanted to make sure that there were from the upland to the water that there were trees and plantings everywhere and of course lots and lots of places to sit and i have to tell you it was incredible people came from all over the city to and i can 't tell you why but i 'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there and here is a new park in lower manhattan now the water 's edge in lower manhattan was a complete mess before nine eleven but i thought if we went to the lower manhattan development corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the and it did lower manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides i really love this park and you can get so close to the water you 're practically on it and see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop and it 's so close how do you turn a park it 's up to you not as a city planner but as a human i mean would you want to go there would you want to stay there can you see into it and out of it are there other people there well now all over new york city there are places where you can find your very own seat where there used to be parking spaces there are now pop up cafes and it 's even harder to keep them so now i 'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park the high line was an elevated railway applause and when the train stopped running it became a self seeded saving the first two sections of the high line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project i knew if there was a day that i it would come down even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular it is the most contested public space in the city but not everyone does commercial interests will always battle against public space how wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the high line well no it would not be terrific it would be a mall but a city has to take the long view the view for the common good the last section of the high line the third section of the high line the final section of the high line has been pitted against development interests where some of the city 's leading developers are building more than seventeen million square feet at the hudson yards and they came to me and proposed that they temporarily disassemble that third and final section perhaps the high line didn 't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a perhaps it was just in their way so you see no matter how popular and successful a public space may be it can never be taken for granted public always this is it saved public spaces always need vigilant champions but to design them for the people that use them then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone that they are not violated invaded abandoned or ignored if there is any one lesson that i have learned in my life as a city planner it is that public spaces have power it 's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city i believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party thank you"
