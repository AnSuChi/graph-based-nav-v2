  "transcript": "connection is very important to me through my work i 'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected i first went to antarctica almost ten years ago where i saw my first icebergs i was in awe and i could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake year after year icebergs are born when they calve each iceberg has its own individual personality while others can 't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion but the reality is far from it i am breathing in its ancient fresh water that nourishes many forms of life i approach photographing these icebergs as if i 'm making portraits of my ancestors knowing that in these individual moments but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life some of the ice in the icebergs that i photograph is very young a couple thousand years old and some of the ice is over one hundred thousand years old greenland so here it is you can see on the left like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline you can see here it begins to roll and the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there this is an an average size greenlandic iceberg it 's about or forty meters and this video is real time"
