  "transcript": "i 'm like shakira shakira meets muhammad ali which they are it only happens from accidents like what happened to me and what got to tell you i 've got ninety nine problems and palsy is just one if there was an oppression olympics i would win i have always loved the fact that my hood and my share the same initials i also love the fact that if i wanted to walk from my house to new york city i could a yes you can can so if my three older sisters were mopping my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that i went too and if we didn 't all get a 's we all got my mother 's slipper my father taught me how to walk when i was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he used is he would dangle by the first day of kindergarten i was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times and they were all my family now there are twenty arabs in town and they are still all my family think anyone even noticed we weren 't italian this was before nine eleven and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use i hate muslims as a campaign slogan i would starve to death during ramadan i would explain to them that i have enough fat to live off of for three whole months so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake yeah on broadway it 's crazy my parents couldn 't afford physical therapy so they sent me to dancing school i learned how to dance in heels which means i can i and when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the jersey shore i did not i spent my summers in a war zone because my parents were afraid that if we didn 't go back to palestine every single summer we 'd grow up to be madonna summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to and i remember the water burning my eyes and thinking it 's working and now i can stand on my parents reinforced this notion that i could do that no dream was impossible and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera general hospital i went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to asu arizona state university because i fit every single quota i was like the pet lemur of the theater department everybody loved me but i never got cast so i start shouting from the rooftops thank god almighty i 'm free at last i didn 't get the part i went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically like someone shot my cat to ask her why and she said it was because they didn 't think i could do the stunts if i can 't do the stunts neither can the character this was a part that i was literally born to play they gave it i moved back home and i knew that i would be promoted from diner diner but instead i remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head and it became clear to me that casting directors didn 't hire fluffy ethnic disabled actors they only hired perfect people but there were exceptions to the rule so i became a comic applause my first gig was driving famous comics from new york city to shows in new jersey and i 'll never forget the face of the first comic i ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the new jersey turnpike with a chick with cp driving uncensored and uncovered and they find us hysterical our goal was to change the negative image of arab americans in media while also reminding casting directors that south asian and arab are not synonymous mainstreaming arabs was much much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability i was invited to be a guest on the cable news show countdown with keith olbermann and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me rolling chair can i have another chair and she looked at me and she went five four three two and we were live so i had to grip onto the anchor 's desk so that i wouldn 't roll off the screen during the segment and i knew i would never get invited back but not only did mr olbermann invite me back he made me a full time contributor and he taped down my chair one fun fact i learned while on the air with keith olbermann was that humans on the internet are scumbags suddenly my disability on the world wide web is fair game i would look at clips online and see comments like should really pray for her comedian palsy disability is as visual as race if a wheelchair user can 't play people with disabilities are the largest minority in the world and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment i don 't think i would be i hope that together we perhaps if there were more positive images it would foster less hate on the internet my crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places i got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva susan lucci and the iconic loreen arbus i got to act in a movie with adam sandler and work with my idol the amazing dave matthews i toured the world as a headliner on arabs gone wild and i founded but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got before this moment but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a muhammad ali and i dedicate this talk to his memory"
