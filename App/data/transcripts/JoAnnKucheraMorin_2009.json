  "transcript": "think of the allosphere as a large dynamically varying digital microscope twenty researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere and be completely immersed in imagine imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain and see tissues as landscapes and hear blood density levels as music this is some of the research that you 're going to see that we 're undertaking at the allosphere but first a little bit about this group of artists scientists and engineers that are working together i 'm a composer our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration this first project is called the allobrain and it 's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful you 're flying through the cortex of my colleague 's brain our narrative here is real fmri data that 's mapped visually and sonically the brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with you see twelve intelligent computer agents the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you we 're now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation biogenerative algorithms are helping us to we 're making new worlds that we can uncover our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code which are computer programs that allow these creatures to grow over time we 're this is real afm atomic force microscope data from my colleagues in the solid state lighting and energy center they 've discovered a new bond a new material hydrogen and zinc you view the bond in the triangle this is we think it makes a beautiful structural art the sound that you 're hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms hydrogen and zinc have their own signature we we 're working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the equation in time what you 're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom you 're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular and you 're going to hear an undulation between the sound this is actually as the sound starts to pulse and contract our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted they 're starting to find new mathematical in these calculations and they 're understanding more about quantum mathematics we 're going to move even further down our colleagues in the center for quantum computation and spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin we 've taken this information and we 've made a mathematical model out of it you 're actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow this is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology"
