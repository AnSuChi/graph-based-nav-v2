  "transcript": "if you were going to invest now there was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were and over eighty percent said that a major life goal for them and another fifty percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous in to work to push harder and achieve more we 're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get most of what we know about but what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy we did that the harvard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that 's ever been done we 've tracked the lives of seven hundred and twenty four men year after year asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up and nobody moves the ball further down the field but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived about sixty of our original seven hundred and twenty four men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s and we are now beginning to study the more than two thousand children of these men and i 'm the fourth director of the study the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at harvard college they all finished college during world war ii and then most went off to serve in the war and the second group that we 've followed was a group of boys from boston 's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boston of the without hot and cold running water when they entered the study all of these teenagers and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life they became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors one president of the united states some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today many of the inner city boston men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just isn 't that interesting the harvard men never ask that question we don 't just send them we talk to their children many of the women said come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we 've generated well the lessons aren 't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder the clearest message that we get from this study is this good relationships keep us happier it turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier they 're physically healthier and they live longer and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five americans will report and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that it 's not just the number of friends you have and it 's not whether or not you 're in a committed relationship but it 's the quality of close relationships it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced and living in the midst of good warm once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who wasn 't and when we gathered together everything we knew about them it was how satisfied they were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age fifty were the healthiest at age eighty and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men it was magnified and the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don 't just protect our bodies they protect our brains out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s and the people in relationships where they feel they really can 't count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier and those good relationships they don 't have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments so this message that good close relationships are good for our health and well being why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore well we 're human what we 'd really like is a quick fix something we can get that 'll make our lives good and keep them that way it 's not sexy or glamorous it never ends the people in our 75 year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life but over and over over these seventy five years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships with family with friends with community so what about you let 's say you 're or you 're forty or you 're sixty what might leaning in to relationships even look like it might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges i 'd like to close with a quote from mark twain and he wrote this there isn 't time and but an instant so to speak for that good life is built with good relationships"
