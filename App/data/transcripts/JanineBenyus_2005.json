  "transcript": "it is a thrill to be here at at a conference that 's devoted to inspired by nature you can imagine and i 'm also thrilled to because i get to talk about one of my favorite critters you haven 't lived until you 've seen these guys do their courtship dance i was on bowman lake in glacier national park which is a long skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it and one of these western grebes came along and what they do for their courtship dance they paddle faster and faster and faster until they 're going so fast that they literally lift up and and so mistaked us for and started to run along the water next to us in a courtship dance for miles it would stop and then start and then stop i came this close to changing species obviously life can teach us something life has a lot to teach us but what i 'd like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design what 's happened since the book came out the book was mainly about research in biomimicry and what 's happened since then is architects designers engineers people who make our world have started to call and say we want a biologist to sit at the design table 'll come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapters in the natural world who might inspire us so this is a picture from a galapagos trip that we took with some wastewater treatment engineers they purify wastewater and some of them were very resistant actually to being there what they said to us at first was you know we an organism to do your wastewater treatment is an old old technology called domestication this is learning something learning an idea from an organism and then applying it and so they still weren 't getting it so we went for a walk on the beach and i said well give me one of your and they said scaling which is and they said you know what and we have to flush the pipes with toxins or we have to dig them up so if we had some way to stop this scaling and so i picked up this is calcium carbonate and then ions from the seawater crystallize in place this is not for lack of information it 's a lack of integration you know they didn 't know that the same thing was happening so ok well if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater self assembly why don 't they just keep on going and i said well in the same way and then they all sort of leaned in they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization it literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal and in fact there is a product called tpa that 's mimicked that that changed everything from then on the first day you know i 've seen that island after this they were crawling all over they would snorkel for as long as we would let them snorkel what had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve learning about the natural world what they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world three point eight billion years of field testing ten to thirty craig venter will probably tell you i think there 's a lot more than thirty million well adapted solutions the important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context and the context is the earth context that we 're trying to solve our our problems in so it 's the conscious emulation of life 's genius it 's not slavishly mimicking although al is trying to get the hairdo going it 's not a slavish it 's taking the design principles the genius of the natural and learning something from it now in a group with so many it people i do have to mention what i 'm not going to talk about and that is that your field is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things on the software side so there 's computers that protect themselves like an immune system and we 're learning from gene regulation and biological development and we 're learning from neural genetic algorithms evolutionary computing but what 's interesting to me is that we haven 't looked at this i mean these machines are really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that so the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms the seats that you 're sitting on how do we redesign the world that we make the human made world and there 's a lot of cool technologies out there three questions for me are key it 's called heat beat and treat that 's what material scientists call it and it 's carving things down from the top with ninety six percent waste left over and only four percent product you heat it up you beat it with high pressures pressures you use chemicals ok heat beat and treat that 's a geranium pollen and its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily look at that shape life adds it gives it a function that 's different than without that structure and thirdly how does life make things disappear because life there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems and at the same time i 'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of grand challenges are the two groups are not talking to each other at all what in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we 're in i one that 's in terms of nanotechnology and it makes it very very tough it 's twice as tough as our high tech ceramics it happens in seawater in and near the organism 's body this is sandia national labs a guy named jeff brinker has found a way to have a self assembling coding process imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature by simply dipping something lifting it out of the liquid and having evaporation force the molecules in the liquid together so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization works imagine making all of our hard materials that way imagine spraying onto into a layered structure that harvests light here 's an interesting one for the it world and so silicon which we make right now it 's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips is a bio mineralization process that 's now being mimicked this is from ernst haeckel 's work and it solidifies out of a liquid process imagine being able to have that sort of structure on the left this is a brittle star it 's covered with lenses that again is that it self assembles a woman named joanna aizenberg at lucent in a low temperature process to create these sort of lenses she 's also looking at fiber optics that 's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic down at the very base of it there 's fiber optics that work better than ours actually but you can tie them in a knot here 's another big idea co2 as a feedstock a guy named geoff coates at cornell right out of co2 he 's found a way he 's found a catalyst and he 's found a way to take co2 and make it into polycarbonates biodegradable plastics out of co2 how plant like solar transformations the most exciting one there are people who are mimicking the of purple bacterium the people at asu even more interesting lately in the last couple of weeks people have seen that and is able to take hydrogen up basically what 's happening in our fuel cells we do with platinum life does it with a very very common iron and a team has now just been able to mimic that power of shape here and those little bumps actually increase efficiency which is an amazing fossil fuel savings if we were to just put that on the on the edge of a wing color without pigments it 's called thin film interference imagine being able to self assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color imagine being able to create a shape on the outside so that it 's self cleaning with just water that 's what a and that 's an up close picture of a lotus leaf there 's a company a self cleaning leaf and rainwater cleans the building water is going to be the one on the left is the namibian beetle pulling water out of fog pulling water out of monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in atlanta before it gets into a building are key technologies separation technologies are going to be extremely important what if we were to say no more hard rock mining what if we were to separate out metals that 's what microbes do they chelate metals out of water there 's a company here in san francisco called green chemistry this is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider and the silk being formed from a spider isn 't that beautiful green chemistry is replacing because life uses only a subset and we use all of them even the toxic ones to figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset of the periodic table and create miracle materials like that cell is the task of green chemistry timed degradation that 's a mussel you can find in the waters out here and the threads holding it to a rock are timed at exactly two years they begin to dissolve healing this is a good one guy over there is a tardigrade there is a problem with vaccines around the world not getting to patients and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken what 's called the cold chain gets broken a guy named bruce rosner and yet stays alive for months and months and months and is able to regenerate itself and he found a way to dry out vaccines encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated they can be put in a this is a session about water learning about organisms that can do without water in order to create a vaccine but what i am going to do is tell you that the most important besides all of these adaptations is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that 's going to take care of their offspring they 're thinking about something very very important and that 's having their genetic material remain ten thousand generations from now there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best version of ten eleven and twelve because we just your slides are so gorgeous ideas are so big i can 't stand to let you go down without seeing ten eleven and twelve jb ok put this ok i great ok so that 's the healing one and yet they don 't collide with one another and yet we have three point six million car collisions a year right there 's a person at newcastle who has figured out that it 's a very large neuron and she 's actually figuring out how to make a collision avoidance circuitry based on this very large neuron in the locust you know net fertility farming we should be growing fertility and oh yes we get food too because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life that 's what whole ecosystems do they create more and more opportunities for life our farming has done the opposite even wastewater treatment but creates incredibly sparkling productivity i mean it looks simple because the system over three point eight billion years has worked this out that is those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places are not around to tell us about it life and this is the secret trick this is the magic trick life creates and it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and while making of this place an eden"
