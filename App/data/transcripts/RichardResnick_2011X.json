  "transcript": "i present to you the human genome women have two copies of that big x chromosome men have the x and of course that small copy of the then everybody can throw around big numbers but in fact if i were to place one base on each pixel of this screen we would need three thousand screens to take a look at the genome so it 's really quite big and perhaps because of its size a group of people all by the way with y chromosomes decided they would want to sequence it and so fifteen years actually and about four billion dollars later the genome was sequenced and published in two thousand and three the final version was published and they keep working on was all done on a machine like this it costs about a dollar for each base a very slow way of doing it well folks i 'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it so now what we do is take a genome we make maybe fifty copies of it we cut all those copies up into little 50 base reads and then we sequence them massively parallel then we bring that into software and reassemble it and tell you what the story is so to give you a picture of what this looks like the human genome project three gigabases right one run on one of these modern machines two hundred gigabases the price of a base to sequence a base has fallen one hundred million times that 's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in waiting until two thousand and eleven and now you can drive to jupiter and back twice the old way of sequencing and here 's all the we know this based on the machines that are being placed this is expected to double triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future in fact there 's one lab in particular that represents twenty percent of all that capacity it 's called the beijing genomics institute the chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new moon age she is treated with surgery chemotherapy and radiation she goes home two years later she comes back with stage 3c ovarian cancer unfortunately treated again with surgery and chemotherapy and it 's because of people like my colleague rick wilson at the genome institute at washington who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem and he took skin cells healthy skin and cancerous bone marrow and sequenced the whole genomes of both of them among other things was a deletion a deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called if you have this deleterious mutation in this but it does have severe profound if you will implications to her family i mean if they have the same mutation and they get this genetic test and they understand it then they can get regular screens and can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life let me introduce you to the beery twins diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two their mom is a very brave woman who didn 't believe it the symptoms weren 't matching up and through some heroic efforts and a lot of internet searching she was able to convince the medical community that in fact they had something else they had and so they were given l dopa and their symptoms did improve but they weren 't totally asymptomatic significant problems remained turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named joe beery who was lucky enough to be the a company called life technologies they 're one of two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools and so he got his kids sequenced what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called spr which is responsible for producing serotonin among other things guys this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing at the time this was a few years ago it cost $ one hundred thousand today it 's $ ten thousand next year so here 's little nick likes batman and squirt guns and it turns out nick shows up at the children 's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim and it 's not that he 's not eating so a hundred surgeries later he looks at his mom and says me i 'm in so much pain his pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what 's going on but he says let 's get this kid 's genome sequenced and what they find is a single point mutation in a gene responsible and that 's a natural reaction which causes some programmed cell death but the gene that regulates that down is and so this informs among other things of course a treatment for bone marrow transplant which he undertakes and after nine months of grueling recovery he 's now eating steak with a1 sauce the prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five ten twenty years just because of this one thing which is a fantastic story so it turns out that the very same technology is also being used wheat soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought of flood of pests unless there 's anybody in the audience who 'd like to volunteer to stop eating none not one this is a typewriter and then more general versions of word processors came about but ultimately it was a disruption on top of a disruption it was bob metcalfe inventing the ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything suddenly we had netscape we had yahoo and we had indeed the entire dot com bubble not to worry though that was quickly rescued by the ipod this is where we are today this is the genomic revolution today this is where we are what i 'd like you to consider is what does it mean when these dots don 't represent the individual bases of your genome but they connect to genomes all across the planet thankfully i was able to answer dna sequencing on your iphone there 's an app for that personalized genomic massage anyone who 's here today with your significant other just turn over to them swab their mouth send it to the lab and you 'll know for sure do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy think of it it 's two thousand and sixteen and the leading candidate releases not only her four and it looks really good then she challenges all her competitors to do the same do you think that 's not going to happen do you think it would have helped john mccain nobody and all moved to different parts so it 's likely i 'm related to every resnick that i ever meet but i don 't know so imagine if my genome were de identified sitting in software and a third cousin 's genome was also sitting there and there was software that could compare the two and make these associations not hard to imagine my company has software that does this right now imagine one more thing that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consent would you be willing to meet your third cousin and if we both say yes voil welcome to chromosomally linkedin raise your hands ok so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child they don 't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society at least not yet and like any new technology it 's really in humanity 's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind or not and so i urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that 's happening all around you thank you"
