  "transcript": "and growing up in these tough situations at the age of seventeen i was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter so as we were sunbathing my best friend next to me says man why doesn 't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don 't have to bathe and i did a little research and i found some very shocking statistics various diseases thrive in this environment the most drastic of which is called trachoma multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind the disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year even if i 'm not just doing it for myself and the except for the 20 rand an hour internet cafe i did research on wikipedia on google about lotions creams the compositions the melting points the toxicities i did high school science and i wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper and it looked like the kfc special spice 40 page business plan on the cell phone having written my patent on the cell phone i 'm the youngest drybath the world 's first lotion you literally put it on your skin and you don 't have to bathe so after having tried to make it work in high school and we have a fully functioning so we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making drybath available one of the things we learned was that poor communities don 't buy products in bulk they buy products on demand a person in alex doesn 't buy a box of cigarettes they buy one cigarette each day even though it 's more expensive and you squeeze it out and the cool part is one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand after creating that model we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath anyway we realized that we could save eighty million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas two hours more for school two hours more for homework two hours more to just be a kid after seeing that global impact we narrowed it down to our key value proposition which was cleanliness and convenience drybath is a rich man 's convenience and a poor man 's lifesaver"
