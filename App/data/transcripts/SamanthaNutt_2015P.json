  "transcript": "and if you did you are forgiven for wondering how a nutt managed to end up in a war zone i actually was offered right out of medical school and accepted a volunteer contract war torn somalia that was worth one dollar i was after all heading into one of the world 's most dangerous places and by now some of you may be asking yourselves and i just want to reassure you that i did get half the money up front journalists called it the city of death and they called it the city of death because three hundred thousand people had lost their lives there three hundred thousand people mostly as a result of part of a team that was tasked with trying to figure out how best to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe and so the question that i was asked to specifically help answer which is one that aid workers ask themselves in war zones the world over is you know the security environment in somalia at that moment in time and nothing has really changed too much can best be described as mad max by way of a clockwork orange and i remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival i went up to a feeding clinic there were dozens of women who were standing in line and they were clutching their infants very close about twenty minutes into this conversation i was having with this one young woman i leaned forward and tried to put my finger in the palm of her baby 's hand she was and her little lifeless hand was curled into itself she had died hours before of malnutrition and dehydration i later learned that as her baby was dying this young woman had been held for two days by some teenage boys who were armed with kalashnikov rifles and they were trying to shake her down for more money money she very clearly did not have and this is a scene that i have confronted some as young as eight they are this big and those kids they have never been to but they have fought and they have killed with automatic rifles is this just the way the world is some will you tell you that war is unavoidably human after all it is as old as existence itself we say never again and yet it happens again and again but i will tell you that i have seen the absolute worst and yet i still believe a different outcome is possible do you want to know why i have come to understand are aspects of this problem that we all of us as people occupying this shared space but by simply looking at all of the options available to us instead of war at the expense of peace how so well i want you to consider this there are at least eight hundred million small arms and light weapons in circulation in the world today the vast majority of civilians like that young baby who are dying in war zones around the world are dying at the hands of various armed groups who rely on a well in some parts of the world you can buy an it is easier to get access to an automatic rifle and so now the important part can anything be done about this and now let 's add in all of the countries that are currently at war and the number of people who have either died or have been displaced as a result of that violence it is a staggering number more than forty million people but you will also notice something else about this map you will notice that most of those countries are in the global south now let 's look at the countries that are the world 's top twenty exporters of small arms in the world and what do we notice well you see them primarily western countries what does this tell us this tells us that most of the people who are dying in war and yet most of the people who are profiting from war and then what if we go beyond small arms for a second if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world who does the biggest business well roughly eighty percent of those weapons come from none other than the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany it 's shocking isn 't it now some of you might be saying at this moment in time but an effect of the violence that plagues them each and every single day you know places like iraq and afghanistan where they need these weapons to be able to maintain law and order promote peace and security to combat terror groups surely this is a good thing and now let 's compare that to the number of people who have directly died in armed conflict around the world in that same period what do you notice well you notice that in fact that also goes up roughly three to fourfold they basically go up and end at the same point now we can have a circular argument here about whether this increase in fatalities is a response to the increase of small arms or the other way around but here 's what we should really take away from this what we should take away from this is that this is a relationship worth especially when you consider that small arms that were shipped to iraq for use by the iraqi army or to syria for so called moderate opposition fighters that those arms many of them are now in the hands of and ending up with groups like boko haram and al qaeda and other militant groups and therein lies the problem because you see small arms anywhere are a menace because their first stop is rarely their last spending on war per person per year now amounts to about two hundred and dollars two hundred and forty nine dollars per person which is roughly twelve times what we spend on foreign aid money that is used to educate and vaccinate children and combat malnutrition in the global south but we can shift that balance how do we do this well it is essentially a problem of both supply and demand so we can tackle it from both sides on the supply side we can push our governments to adopt international arms transparency mechanisms like the arms trade treaty which makes it so that rich countries have to be more accountable for where their arms are going and what their arms might be used for the largest arms exporting country in the world by far until it is approved and ratified by the senate this is where we need to make our voices heard the curbing of small arms it 's not going to solve the problem of war increased control mechanisms won 't solve that problem but it 's an important step in the right direction and it 's up to all of us who live in those rich countries to make change here there are generations around the world who are being lost to war it is possible to disrupt that cycle of violence with investments in education in strengthening the rule of law and in economic development especially for women i have personally regular contributions like monthly contributions are a far more effective way of giving because they allow humanitarian organizations to properly plan and be invested over the long term and to be present in the lives of families who have been affected by war that many of us frankly all too quickly forget and i know what it means to lie in bed automatic gunfire and wonder with absolute dread how many minutes i have left until it will be right on top of me i can tell you that it is a terrifying and agonizing fear one that millions of people around the world are forced to confront each and every single day unfortunately war has killed but is why i get up and do what i do every single day that we can make different choices here spread it and wage it we are therefore not powerless to solve it on the contrary we are the only ones who can thank you very much and i want to wish you the"
