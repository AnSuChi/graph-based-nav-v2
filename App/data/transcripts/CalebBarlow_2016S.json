  "transcript": "this over two billion records lost our health insurance data what 's particularly concerning about this it was months before anyone even reported that these records you would think that most of this is espionage or nation state activity but in this case it is only a small portion of the problem that we 're dealing with how often do we hear about a breach followed by it was the result of a sophisticated nation state attack well often that is companies not being willing to own up to their own lackluster security practices there is also a widely held belief that by blaming an attack on a nation state you are putting regulators at bay so where is all of this coming from the united nations estimates that eighty percent of it is from highly organized and this represents one of the largest illegal economies in the world topping out at now get this four hundred and billion dollars let me put that in perspective for all of you four hundred and including ireland finland denmark and portugal to name a few let me tell you a little story about a year ago our security researchers were tracking a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated banking trojan called the dyre wolf and then use that to steal your money this form of attack is somewhat commonplace however the dyre wolf had two distinctly different personalities but it took on an entirely different persona if you were in the business of moving here 's what would happen so you pick up the phone and you call and after going through the normal voice prompts you 're met with an english speaking operator hello altoro mutual bank how can i help you and you go through the process like you do every time you call your bank of giving them your name and your account number going through the security checks to verify you are who you said you are but in many large scale wire and goes through the same set of verifications and checks sounds normal right and this was so flawlessly executed that they were moving between a half a million and a million and a half dollars per attempt into their criminal coffers these criminal organizations operate like highly regimented legitimate businesses their employees work monday through friday they take the weekends off how do we know this we know this because our security researchers see repeated spikes of malware on a friday afternoon after a long weekend with the wife and kids come back in to see how well things went the dark web is where they spend their time that is a term used to describe the anonymous here they peddle their attack software and share information you can buy everything there from a base level attack to a much more advanced version you can even buy attacks that come now these environments these marketplaces they look like you see products prices ratings and reviews of course if you 're going to buy an attack you 're going to buy from a reputable criminal with good ratings right laughter this isn 't any different than checking on yelp or tripadvisor before going to a new restaurant this is an actual screenshot we even see things like licensing terms here 's an example of a site you can go to if you want to change your identity give me a break what are they going to do sue you if you violate them this occurred a couple of months ago one of our security researchers was looking at a new android malware application that we had discovered it was called bilal bot inexpensive and beta alternative to the much more advanced gm bot that was commonplace so they wrote her this very email pleading their case and making the argument that they felt she had evaluated an older version they asked her to please update her blog with more accurate information and even offered to do an interview to describe so look you don 't have to like what they do but you do have to respect the entrepreneurial nature of their endeavors so how are we going to stop this it 's not like we 're going to be able to they operate with anonymity i would propose that we need a and that approach needs to be centered on the idea let 's think of the response we see bird flu zika what is the top it 's knowing who is infected and how the disease is spreading physicians everyone responds openly this is a collective and altruistic effort to stop the spread in its tracks and to inform anyone not this is not at all what we see in response to a cyber attack because they 're worried about competitive advantage litigation or regulation we need to effectively democratize threat intelligence data we need to get all of these organizations to open up and share what is in their private arsenal of information we 've got to move faster and the best way to do that is to open up and share data on what 's happening let 's think about this in the construct we 've got to turn that thinking on its because if you share the information it 's equivalent to inoculation and but there 's an even bigger we inform the people they aim to hurt we make cybercrime but to do this a first mover was required someone to change the thinking in the security industry overall about a year ago my colleagues and i were to take our data we had one of the largest threat intelligence databases in the world and open it up what if we were to publish it all as you can this got quite a reaction first came the lawyers what are the legal implications of doing that then came the business what are the business implications of doing that and this was also met with a good dose of a lot of people just asking if we were completely crazy but there was one conversation that kept floating to the surface in every dialogue that we would have the realization that if we didn 't do this then we were part of the problem so we did something unheard of in the security industry including information on real time attacks that can be used to stop cybercrime in its tracks including half of the fortune one hundred and our hope as a next step is to get all of those organizations to join us in the fight and do the same thing and share their information on when and how they 're being attacked as well we all have the opportunity to stop it and we already all know how all we have to do is look to the response that we see in the world of health care thank you"
