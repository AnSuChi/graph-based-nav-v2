  "transcript": "specifically to june the british association for the advancement of science is holding its third meeting at the university of cambridge it 's the first and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever an elderly white haired man stands up they 're even more shocked by what he says you must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers they were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the british association the crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly young cambridge scholar named william whewell stood up and quieted the audience he politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist if ' philosophers ' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term he said then by how could the word scientist not have existed until what were scientists called before what had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils like charles darwin for example or the hired help of a nobleman like joseph who was the literary companion to the marquis of lansdowne when he discovered oxygen after this they were scientists much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at cambridge university in one thousand eight hundred and twelve invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer john herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere and in his spare i 'm sure we could all be that productive without facebook or twitter to take up our time richard jones became an important economist who later influenced karl marx but spearheaded international big science with his the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution they felt science had stagnated and i 'm going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made francis bacon and then later isaac had proposed an inductive scientific method now that 's a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about the members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed they wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers university students reading one of herschel 's books was such a watershed moment for charles darwin that he would later say scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me it made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen or for one 's own personal gain for example ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains the philosophical breakfast club changed that working together whewell 's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters ' knowledge to all ship captains herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of south africa and as he complained to whewell he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble the four men they also relentlessly lobbied the british government for the money to build babbage 's engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society in the days before pocket calculators the numbers that most professionals needed insurance agents ship captains engineers were to be found in lookup books like this filled with tables of figures but these calculations were really difficult i mean this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year hundred and sixty five calculations so these tables were filled with mistakes babbage 's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables two models of his engine were built in the last twenty years by a team from the science museum of london using his own plans this is the one now at the computer history museum in california and it calculates accurately it actually works it had a separate memory and central processor and it was programmable using punched cards an idea babbage took from jacquard 's loom tragically babbage 's engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non human computers would have no usefulness for the public [ new scientific founded in bacon 's time the royal society of london was the foremost scientific society in england and even in the rest of the world it had become a the members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies including the british association they reinstated the tradition of the q & a after scientific papers were read which had been discontinued by the royal society as being and for the first time they gave women a foot in the door of science members were encouraged to bring their wives daughters and sisters to the meetings of the british association and while the women were expected to attend they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well the british association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members [ external funding for science ] occasionally there were prizes such as that given to john harrison in the for solving the so called longitude problem but prizes were only given after the fact when they were given at all on the advice of the philosophical breakfast club the british association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy the tides fossil and many other areas eventually the royal society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit and this has become fortunately it 's become a major part of the scientific landscape they would have been deeply dismayed by today 's disjunction between science and the rest of culture and this was tested by asking simple questions like did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the earth at the same time and what proportion of the earth is covered in water members of a professional group they were slowly walled off from the rest of us this is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends charles darwin said i sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work in fact origin of species and was widely read when it first appeared darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten that science is not only for scientists thank you"
