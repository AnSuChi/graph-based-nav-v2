  "transcript": "and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children if any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents they were scolded and told that for their own good they must never go in there again then one day a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents ' rooms look what they 've been hiding from you said well there was a girl in the town or if they were there ought to be a law to allow the children access and so she set about to make it so i 'm the girl in that story and the secret documents that i was interested in were located in this building the british i thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy it wasn 't like i was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker or anything like that but the amount of resistance i got from this you would have thought i 'd asked something and it was it was one of many hundreds of requests that i made not i didn 't hey look i didn 't set out honestly to revolutionize the british parliament and i 've got to tell you i wasn 't that hopeful because i 'd seen the establishment i thought it always sticks together i am out of luck well guess what i won hooray that 's not exactly the story because the problem was that parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data the transparency law they 'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else they tried to keep it so it didn 't apply to them and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database and then you all remember there was weeks and weeks of revelations everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off the end result was the first speaker of the house in three hundred years was forced to resign and so far four mps and two lords have done jail time for fraud tell you that story because it wasn 't unique to britain it was an example of a culture clash that 's happening all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged and then suddenly confronted slightly embarrassing admission even when i was a kid i used to have these little spy books and i would like see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down i think that was a pretty good indication about my future and it 's gone mainstream everybody increasingly around the world wants to know about what people in power are doing they want a say in decisions that are made in their name it 's about searching for the truth not because somebody says it 's true because i say so no it 's about trying to find the truth based on what you can see and what can be tested the divine right of kings to rule over people or that women should be subordinate to men or that the church was and they tried to suppress it and then they had the printing press which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply far and fast and people would come together in coffee houses discuss the ideas plot revolution in our day we have digitization that strips all the physical mass out of information so now it 's almost zero cost to copy and share information our printing press is the internet our coffee houses are social networks we and we have global decisions to make in this system decisions about climate about finance systems about resources and think about it if we want to make an important decision about we need a lot of information to take in it 's just not possible for one person to take in the amount the volume of information and analyze it to make good decisions so that 's why we 're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information so if your water company is dumping water you have a right to know about it in the finance industry you now have more of a right to know about what 's going on so we have different and it 's getting harder to hide and they 're all moving to this central this fully connected system and how is it possible that the volume of information can be processed that needs to in this and i think this is largely what 's behind the crisis of legitimacy in our in our different governments right now so this is a guy called seb bacon he 's a computer programmer and what it is and it allows you to make a freedom of information request to ask your public body a question so and i can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests so it takes all of that hassle out and you just type in your question for example how many police officers have a criminal record it zooms it off to the appropriate person and then there 's a few more coming on board of you out there like the sound of that and have a law like that in your country i know that seb would love to hear from you about collaborating and and getting that into your country and quite an unusual mp in iceland she was one of the protesters who was outside of parliament when and then she was elected and they 've just got funding to make it an international modern media project and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression protection of source protection and trying to make iceland a publishing haven it 's a place where your data can be free so when we think about increasingly how governments want to access user data what they 're trying to do in iceland is make this safe haven where it can happen in my own field of investigative journalism we 're also having to start thinking globally so this is a site called investigative dashboard if you 're trying to track a dictator 's assets for example hosni mubarak you know he 's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he 's in trouble and what you want to do to investigate that is you need to have access to all of the world 's as many as you can so this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start but again when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most perhaps the most important decisions so we 're still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information through leaks so when the guardian did this investigation about the afghan war you know they can 't walk into the department of defense and and ask for all the information you know they 're just not going to get it so this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by american soldiers and then they 're able to do this investigation rather large investigation and i was involved in this investigation because i got this leak through a leak from a disgruntled wikileaker so i can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak it was amazing i mean it was amazing it reminded me of that scene in the wizard of oz do you know the one i mean where the little dog toto runs across to where the wizard [ is ] and he pulls back the dog 's pulling back the curtain and don 't look behind the screen don 't look at the man behind the screen it was just like that because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen quite gossipy those cables okay but i thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp these are human beings just like us they don 't have special powers they 're not magic they are not our parents beyond that what i found most and particularly centered around the heart of power because surely what could be more open than publishing all the material because that that is what julian assange did he wasn 't content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal he threw it all out there that did end up with vulnerable people in afghanistan being exposed it also meant that the belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the u s government is that radical openness i say it 's not because for me what it means it doesn 't mean abdicating power responsibility also the fact that he threatened to sue me because i got a leak of his leaks i thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology to be honest as well i think you come to the table when you 're dealing with power talking about power because of its seductive capacity you 've got to have skepticism and humility because you must always be challenging i want to see why do you you just say so that 's not good enough i want to see the evidence behind why that 's so and humility because we are all human we all and i think you you only have to read animal farm to get that message about how power corrupts people it is i believe to embody within the rule of law rights to information at the moment our rights are incredibly weak in a lot of countries we have official secrets acts including in britain here we have an official secrets act with no public interest test so that means it 's a crime people are punished quite severely in a lot of cases for publishing or giving away official information and really this is what i want all of you to think about if we had an official disclosure act where officials so that yes yes my power pose i would like us to work towards that so it 's not all bad news i mean there closed it becomes so it was only just the other week that i heard london 's metropolitan police commissioner and he said it was a matter of life and death he actually said that it was a matter of life and death there was no evidence he presented no evidence of that it was just because i say so you have to trust me take it on faith well i 'm sorry people but we are back to the pre enlightenment church and we need to fight against that so he was talking about the law in britain which is the communications data bill an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation in america you have the cyber intelligence sharing and protection act you 've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance you have the national security agency building the world 's giantest spy center it 's just this colossal it 's five times bigger than the u s capitol in which they 're going to intercept"
