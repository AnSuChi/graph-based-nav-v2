  "transcript": "there was little to warn of the danger ahead the iraqi insurgent had placed the ied an improvised explosive device along the side of the road with great care by two and they were the leading cause of casualties among american soldiers and iraqi civilians the team that was hunting for this ied is called an eod team explosives ordinance disposaland they 're the pointy end of the spear in the american effort to suppress these roadside bombs each eod team goes out on about six hundred of these bomb calls every year defusing about two bombs a day perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort is that the iraqi insurgents put a $ fifty thousand bounty on the head of a single eod soldier it exploded in a close you are and how much it can cause death or injury you have to be as far as fifty yards away to escape that the blast is so strong it can even break your limbs even if you 're not hit and he wrote a condolence letter back to the united states and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit about the fact that they had lost their and he apologized but then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss you don 't have to write a letter to its mother that scene sounds like science fiction but is battlefield reality already which is named after the asimov novel and the that 's a reality we face today what we 're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage it 's just to give you a taste anything that 's powered by vulcan technology or teenage teenage wizard hormones or anything like that this is all real so why don 't we go ahead and start those pictures we now have five thousand three hundred we now have twelve thousand and the tech term the wright flyers compared to what 's coming soon and he said basically where we 're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts and these numbers matter because we 're not just talking about tens of thousands of today 's robots but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow 's robots because of course one of the things that 's operating in technology is moore 's law that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots and so flash forward around twenty five years if moore 's law holds true those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today and so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like comic con have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the pentagon a robots revolution is upon us now i need to be clear here i 'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the governor of california showing up at your door when historians look at this period they 're going to conclude that we 're in a different type of revolution a revolution in war but it may be even bigger than that because our unmanned systems don 't just affect the how of war fighting be it the machine gun be it the was about a system that either shot faster went further had a bigger boom another way of putting this is that mankind monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime i 've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the 19 year old drone pilots who are fighting from nevada to the four star generals who command them to even the iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our in our law and our ethics etc and so what i 'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these even a robotics one is not going to be purely an american one but we know that in technology there 's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage in a quick show of hands how many people china pakistan iran and this raises a bigger worry for me how do we move forward in this revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools but just as software has a lot of it 's even do it yourself one of those things you just saw flashed you can build one yourself equivalent to what the soldiers use in iraq that raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict a state and hezbollah a non state actor the non state actor flew four different drones against israel there 's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq while sitting at your home computer but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism the future of it may be a cross between al qaeda two point zero and the next generation of the unabomber and another way of thinking about this is the fact that and he put it this way i like these systems because they save but i worry about more marketization of wars more shock and awe talk to defray discussion of the costs people are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic we don 't have and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground but that is our new technologies don 't merely remove humans from risk they also record everything that they see so they don 't just delink the public most of it gathered by drones this could be a good thing it could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before but remember this is taking place in our and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to you know your ipod or your zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment the typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment missile hits this ability to watch more but experience less i think about this with a sports a professional basketball game on tv where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like but we have to remember these are just the clips these are just the espn sportscenter version of the game it 's our human psychology so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we 're fighting against radical groups what is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message so one of the people that i met was a senior bush administration official who had this to say about our unmanning of war the thing that scares people is our technology and this is but they 're afraid to fight the future of war also is featuring a new type of warrior and it 's actually redefining the experience of going to war you can call this a cubicle warrior this is what one predator drone pilot described of his experience fighting in the iraq war while never leaving nevada you directing kills on enemy combatants and then you get in the car and you drive home and within twenty minutes you 're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework but some have worries that this disconnection will lead to something else that it might make the of war crimes a lot easier when you have this distance it 's like a video game is what one young pilot described to me of taking out enemy troops from afar as anyone who 's played grand theft auto knows we do things in the video world that we wouldn 't do face to face so much of what you 're hearing from me is that there 's another side to technologic revolutions but so 's murphy 's law but we 're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas sometimes these are just oops moments which is what the head of a robotics company described it you just have sometimes they 're like that scene from the eddie murphy movie best defense playing out in reality where they tested out a machine gun armed robot and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of where an anti aircraft cannon had a software glitch and nine soldiers were killed we have new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability what do we do with things like unmanned slaughter we 've already had three instances of predator drone and it turned out not to be the case this is not even talking about armed autonomous systems with full authority to use force and do not believe that that isn 't coming and so you have this question what does this lead to issues like war crimes but robots are emotionless and so we have this question to figure out and so in conclusion and so this sets a great challenge for all of us that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your roomba sucking the life away from you are we going to let the fact that what 's unveiling itself right now in war sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial are we going to face the reality of 21st century war is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry and not deal the issues that surround it until pandora 's box is already opened up moral issues when it comes to robots that is he added unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly then it 's just a product recall issue we can turn to hollywood a few years ago hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top one hundred heroes and top one hundred villains of all of hollywood history the terminator and now we 're using our creativity maybe even one day an entirely new species but one of the main reasons that we 're doing that and so the question we all should ask is it our machines or is it us that 's wired for war"
