  "transcript": "in a small of lynwood california just a few miles southeast of los angeles a father came out of his house and as the father was administering these instructions a car drove and just after it passed the father and the teenagers a hand went out from the front passenger window and the police investigating and in less than twenty four hours they had selected their suspect 17 year old kid who lived about two or three blocks away from where the shooting occurred and he said that 's the picture that 's the shooter i saw that killed the mr carrillo over to stand trial for a first degree murder in the investigation that followed before the each of the other five teenagers was shown the picture that we best can determine was probably the one that they were shown in the photo array is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots the reason we 're not sure absolutely is because of the nature of evidence preservation but that 's another whole tedx talk for later and transported to folsom prison no gun was ever found no vehicle was ever identified as being the one in which the shooter had extended his arm and no person was ever charged with being the driver of the shooter 's vehicle which of those parents here in the room might not lie concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter in an investigation of a killing sent adamantly insisting on his innocence which he has the problems actually for this kind of case come manyfold from decades of scientific research first of all we have all the statistical analyses from the innocence project work where we know that we have what two hundred and fifty two hundred and eighty documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated some from death row and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them the other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory the brain the absolute best we only detect encode and store in our brains bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us and they 're stored in different parts of the brain so now when it 's important for us to be able to recall what it was that we experienced and what happens the brain fills in information that was not there not originally stored from inference from speculation from sources of information that came to you as the observer after the observation but it happens without awareness such that it 's called reconstructed memories it happens to us in all the aspects of our life all the time the fact about the eyewitness fallibility that was part of the instigation for a group of appeal attorneys led by an amazing lawyer named ellen eggers to pool their experience and their talents together and petition a superior court because i had expertise in eyewitness memory identification which obviously makes sense for this case right but also because i have expertise and testify about the nature of human night vision well what 's that got to do with this well when you read through the case materials in this carrillo case one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good good at the crime scene at the shooting but this occurred did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on earth at the time of the incident of the shooting all right so all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here the only lighting in that area had to come from artificial and that 's where i go out and i do the actual reconstruction of the scene with photometers with various measures of illumination and various other measures of of take all the measurements and record them right and then take photographs and this is what the scene looked like at the time of the shooting from the position of the teenagers looking at the car going by and shooting this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing remember the investigating officers ' report said the lighting was good the teenagers said they could see very well and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers as you can see it is at best poor no one 's going to call this and in fact as nice as these pictures are and the reason we take them is i knew i was going to have to testify in court and a picture is worth abstract concepts like lux the international measurement of illumination the ishihara color their eyes just glaze over all right a and that 's part of the reason why we take the pictures to but more importantly were to me as a scientist are those readings the photometer readings which i can then convert into actual predictions of the visual capability of the human eye and from my readings that i recorded at the scene under the same solar and lunar conditions at the same time so on and so forth right and that there would be only scotopic vision which means there would be very little resolution what we call boundary or edge because the eyes would have been totally dilated under this light the depth of field the distance at which you can focus and see details would have been and while the judge was very i noticed out of the i think you should go out and look at the scene yourself now i may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request but nonetheless it 's to this man 's credit and his courage i will a shocker so in fact we found the same identical conditions we reconstructed the entire thing again he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff 's officers to protect him in this so he stood a few feet from the curb we had a car that came by same identical car as described by the teenagers right it had a driver and a passenger and after the car had passed the judge by the passenger extended his hand pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on just as the teenagers had described it he pointed by and this is what the judge saw this is the car thirty feet away from the judge there 's an arm sticking out of the passenger side and pointed back at you some of the teenagers said that that in fact the car was fifteen feet away when it shot okay there 's fifteen feet at this point i became a little concerned this judge is someone you 'd never want to play poker with i couldn 't see a twitch of his eyebrow i couldn 't see the slightest bend of his head i had no sense of how he was reacting to this he turned to me and he says is there anything else you want me to look at i said your honor and i don 't know whether i was emboldened by the scientific measurements that i had in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate or whether it was just sheer stupidity which is what the defense lawyers thought when they heard me say your honor i want you stand right there and i want the car to go around the block again and i want it to come and i want it to stop and i want and you can look at which was also in my test report all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side which means that the shooter 's face would have been photo occluded it would have been backlit furthermore the roof of the car is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car which is making it darker i knew that the depth of field was eighteen inches or less three to four feet it might as well have been this is what he saw he went back mr carrillo so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense if the prosecution decided which they decided not to he and his son are both attending cal state long what does this example i could regale you with horror stories of ignorance over decades of experience as a forensic expert the opposing council always fight it and oppose it through procedures to get more and i think one large step toward that is more requirements with all due respect to the law schools of science technology engineering mathematics for anyone going into the law because they become the judges it 's very different than most other cultures all right the caution that all of us have to have constantly have to remind myself about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true that we believe in there is decades of research examples and examples of cases like this where individuals really believe none of those teenagers who identified him none of them thought they couldn 't see the person 's face all our memories are reconstructed memories they are the product of what we originally experienced and we all need to remember to be cautious that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are nor how certain you are that they 're correct"
