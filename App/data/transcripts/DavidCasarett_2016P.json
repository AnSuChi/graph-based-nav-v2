  "transcript": "i would like to tell you about the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me in my years of working as a palliative care physician i was as a consultant to see a woman in her 70s retired english professor i thought back to that i had learned in medical school about medical marijuana which didn 't take very long because i had learned absolutely nothing and she smiled and nodded and reached into the handbag next to the bed and pulled out a stack of about a dozen randomized controlled trials showing that medical marijuana has benefits for symptoms like nausea and pain and anxiety she handed me those articles and said maybe you should read these before offering an opinion doctor so i did that night i read all of those articles and found a bunch more when i came to see her the next morning i had to admit that it looks like there is some evidence that marijuana can offer medical benefits and i suggested that if she really was interested she should try it you know what she said this retired english professor i 've been using it every day since it 's the best drug i 've discovered i don 't know why it took me seventy three years to discover this stuff it 's amazing that was the moment at which i realized i needed to learn something about medical marijuana because what i was prepared for in medical school bore no relationship to reality so i started reading more articles i started talking to researchers i started talking to doctors and most importantly i started one i already alluded to that there really are some benefits to medical marijuana those benefits may not be as huge or as stunning as some of the most avid proponents of medical marijuana would have us believe but they are real surprise number two medical marijuana does have some risks those risks may weren 't turning to medical marijuana because of its benefits or the balance of risks and benefits or because they thought it was a wonder drug it let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them to show you what i mean let me tell you about another patient robin was in her early 40s when i met her she looked though like she was she had to rely on a wheelchair to get around and i guess physically she probably was she was among the toughest people i 've ever met and when i sat down next to her in a what it did for her and how it helped her and that is that it gave her control over her life and over her health she could use it when she wanted in the way that she wanted at the dose and frequency that worked for her and if it didn 't work for her then she could make changes everything was up to her the most important thing she said was she didn 't need anybody else 's permission and if that seems like a little thing for somebody with chronic illness not at all and note what i said when not if all of us at some point in our lives will face a chronic serious illness that causes us to lose control we 'll see our function decline some of us will see our cognition decline we 'll be no longer able to care for ourselves to do the things that we want to do our bodies will betray us and that 's scary not when i talk to my patients my palliative care patients many of constipation fatigue their impending mortality but what scares them more than anything else tomorrow or a month from now they 're going to lose control of their health of their lives of their healthcare and they 're going to become so it 's no wonder really that patients like robin who i just told you about who i met in that clinic turn to medical marijuana to try to claw back some semblance of control how do they do it though how do these medical marijuana dispensaries like the one where i met robin how do they give patients like robin back the sort of control that they need so i decided to find out i got that recommendation illegally because i 'm not a resident of california i should note that i should also note for the record that i never used that letter of recommendation to make a purchase and to all of you dea agents out there laughter keep it up it let me experience what patients like robin experience when they go to a medical marijuana dispensary hundreds of thousands of people like robin i walked into the clinic and from the moment that i entered many of these clinics and i felt like that dispensary that clinic was there for me what my goals are or what am i afraid these are the sorts of questions that patients like robin get asked all the time these are the sorts of questions that make me confident that the person i 'm talking with really has my best interests at heart and wants to get to know me the second thing i learned in those clinics is the availability of education education from the folks behind the counter but also education from folks in the waiting room people i met were more than happy as i was sitting next to them people like robin and to give me advice and suggestions those waiting rooms really are a hive of interaction advice and support i was amazed at how willing those people were to spend sometimes an hour or more talking me through the nuances of remember without me making any purchase whatsoever think about the last time you went to any hospital or clinic and the last time anybody spent an hour explaining those sorts of things to you the fact that patients like robin are going to these clinics are going to these dispensaries and people like robin are turning away from mainstream medicine turning to medical marijuana dispensaries because those dispensaries are giving them what they need wake up call to the medical call that many of my colleagues are either not hearing or not wanting to hear when i talk to my colleagues physicians in particular they say oh we need more evidence we need more research into benefits we need more evidence about risks we do need much more evidence about the benefits of medical so we absolutely do need research but to say that we need research and not that we need to make any changes now is to miss the point or because they think it 's entirely wake up call we really need to pay attention to the good news though is that there are lessons we can learn today from those medical marijuana dispensaries and those are lessons we really should learn these are often small mom and pop operations run by people with no medical training and while it 's embarrassing to think that many of these clinics and dispensaries are providing services and support and meeting patients ' needs in ways that how to use medications in ways that work for them in my own practice i 've gotten much more creative and flexible but here 's the point but they can also be ineffective if they 're not used in a way that 's consistent with what patients want and need so that flexibility if it 's delivered safely can be extraordinarily valuable for patients and their families that 's number one number two education huge opportunities to learn from some of the tricks of those medical marijuana dispensaries to provide more education that doesn 't require a lot of physician time necessarily or any physician time trajectories of and last but not least putting patients first the way those medical marijuana dispensaries do making patients feel legitimately like what they want they need is why as healthcare providers we 're here i ask all my patients what they 're hoping for and what they 're afraid of but here 's the thing patients shouldn 't have to wait until they 're chronically seriously ill often near have to wait until they 're seeing a physician like me before somebody asks them what are you hoping for what are you afraid of that should be baked into the way that healthcare is delivered we can do this we really can medical marijuana dispensaries and clinics all across the country are figuring this out they 're figuring this out in ways that and we have to learn from them all we have to do is swallow our pride we know all there is to know about how to meet patients ' needs we need to swallow our pride we need to go visit a we need to figure out what their tricks are what their tools are and we need to learn from them if we do and i think we can and i absolutely think we have to we can guarantee all of our patients will have a much better experience"
