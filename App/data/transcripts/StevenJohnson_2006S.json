  "transcript": "if you haven 't ordered yet i generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine so sorry it just feels like i should be doing stand up up here because of the setting no what i want to do is back to one thousand eight hundred and fifty four in london for the next few minutes and tell the story i think helped create the world that we live in today and particularly the kind of city that we live in today this period in one thousand eight hundred and fifty four in the middle part of the 19th in london 's history is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons but i think the most important one is that london was this city of two point five million people and so the victorians were trying to live through and and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living this scale of living that we in many ways at this point in the a complete disaster they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an elizabethan public infrastructure so people for instance just to gross you out for a second had cesspools of human waste in their basement and they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away and of course it never really would go away and all of this stuff basically had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in it was an amazingly smelly city not just because of the cesspools but also the the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people not just the horses but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk that they would up there and keep them in the attic until until literally their milk ran out and they died and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street so you would just walk around london at this point and just be overwhelmed with this and what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was everybody that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years and cholera was really the great killer of this period it arrived in london in and every four or five years another epidemic would take u k and so the authorities became convinced that this this smell was this problem we had to get rid of the smell and so in fact they concocted a couple of early you know founding public health interventions in the system of the city one of which was called the nuisances act which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and and oh right we drink from the river so what ended up happening actually is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because as we now know cholera is actually in the water it 's a waterborne disease not something that 's in the air it 's not something you smell and so one of the founding moments of public health in in the 19th century effectively poisoned the water supply of london much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing so was the state of london in one thousand eight hundred and fifty four and in the middle of all this carnage and and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people it was a very 19th century who was a local doctor in soho in london who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was in fact a waterborne disease and he 'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies but nothing had really stuck and part of what 's so interesting about this story to me is is that in some ways it 's a great case study in how cultural change happens how a good idea eventually comes august 28th of a young child a five month old girl whose first name we don 't know we know her only as baby lewis somehow contracted cholera came down with cholera at forty broad street you can 't really see it in this this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book it 's in the middle of soho in this working class neighborhood this little girl becomes sick bordered on an extremely popular water pump local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of soho that all the residents from soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to and so this little girl inadvertently ended up and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of literally ten percent of the neighborhood died in in seven days and much more would have died if people hadn 't fled after the alone in their one room apartments just an extraordinary terrifying scene snow heard about the outbreak and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that in fact the real menace of cholera was was in the water supply and and not in the air he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source one single thing that that everybody was going to because it didn 't have the traditional slower path and so he went right in there and and started interviewing people he eventually enlisted the the help of of this amazing other figure who 's kind of the other protagonist of the book and eventually snow made a map of the outbreak he found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick people who hadn 't drunk from the pump were not getting sick and he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods people who hadn 't you know percentages of people who hadn 't but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could and so he created this which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address and you can see in this map the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about fifteen people dead and the map is actually a little bit bigger as you get further and further away from the pump the deaths begin to and so you can see this and so with the help of this map and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that whitehead did eventually actually the authorities slowly started to come around it took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story but by when the next big cholera outbreak came to london the authorities had been convinced in in part because of this story in part because of this map and they had already started building the sewers in london and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water and that was the last time that london has seen a cholera outbreak since so part of this story i think well it 's a terrifying a very dark story and it 's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world it 's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic which is to say that it 's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps the idea of large scale metropolitan living a sustainable one"
