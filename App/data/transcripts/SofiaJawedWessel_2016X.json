  "transcript": "we 're going to share a lot of secrets today you and i and in doing so i hope that we can lift some of the shame many of us feel about sex how many here have ever been for me the time i remember best is when that stranger was a student of mine he came up to me after class that night i would never have said those things this concept called objectification we see it in the government that refuses to we see it in advertisements how many of you have seen an advertisement that or movie after movie after movie that portrays women as only love interests slowly building into a culture that refuses to see women as people we see this in the that sends home 10 year old girl because her clothes were a distraction to boys trying to learn or the government that refuses to punish men for raping women over and over media plays a large role in perpetuating the objectification of women let 's consider the classic romantic comedy we 're typically introduced to two kinds of women in these movies two kinds of desirable women anyway this is the unbelievably gorgeous woman with the perfect body our leading man has no trouble identifying her and even less trouble having sex with her second is our leading lady the beautiful but demure woman our leading man falls in love with marriage material we 're actually told that women have two roles but these two roles have a difficult time existing within the same woman on the rare occasion that i share with a new acquaintance that i study sex if they don 't end the conversation right then they 're usually pretty intrigued in studying the sexual behaviors of pregnant and postpartum couples at this point i get a different kind of response oh huh do pregnant people even have sex have you thought about studying sexual desire or orgasms tell me what are the first words that come to mind when you picture a pregnant woman i asked this question in a survey of over five hundred adults and most responded with belly or round and cute this didn 't surprise me too much what else do we label as cute and then asked women to imagine that they are pregnant and then tell me the first words that come to mind when they imagine having sex most of the responses were negative we are removing the constraints of sexual objectification they experience less sexism right not exactly what happens instead is a different kind of objectification in my efforts to explain this to others one conversation led to the venus of a paleolithic figurine scholars assumed was a goddess of love and beauty hence the name venus this theory was later revised though when scholars noted the sculptor 's obvious focus on the figurine 's reproductive features large breasts considered ideal for nursing the remnants of red dye alluding to menstruation or birth they also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed she also had no face for this reason it was assumed that she was a representation of fertility and not a a portrait of a person she was an object i think this transition speaks more about the scholars who have interpreted her purpose than she leaves the realm realm of men 's sexual desire and slides into her reproductive and child rearing role she also becomes the property of the community considered very important but only because she 's pregnant right i 've taken to calling this the willendorf effect and once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her life has anyone here ever been visibly pregnant yeah lots of you right so how many of you ever had a stranger touch your belly during maybe without even asking your permission first or told what you can and cannot eat and then told why those choices are all wrong yeah this one might give you this is a huge secret it is actually safe to drink in moderation during pregnancy many of us don 't know this because doctors don 't trust pregnant women with this secret especially if she 's less educated or a woman of color what this tells us is when the government reminds women with every new anti choice bill that the contents of her uterus are not her own or when better safe than sorry right she 's denied basic privacy and bodily autonomy under the guise of be a good remember when we tell women that sexual pleasure so what we are telling her is that she in fact doesn 't matter even though the needs of her her fetus are not at odds with her own needs so such as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists have the opportunity to educate about acog actually has no public official statement about the the safety of sex during pregnancy guidance from the mayo clinic is generally positive but presented with a caveat and that 's ok too needs to stop is society telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies pregnant women are not faceless identity less vessels of reproduction who can 't stand on their own two feet we refuse to even acknowledge that women who have sex with women or women who don 't want children even exist oh it 's just a phase she just needs the right man to come along every time a woman has sex she is pushing back against society 's insistence that she exist simply for men 's pleasure or for reproduction a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs is scary because a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs prioritizes herself that is a woman demanding that she be treated as an equal that is a woman who insists that you make and that is the most terrifying of all because we can 't make room for her without some of us giving up the extra space we hold i am the mother of two boys and we could use your help hear me say regularly that it 's important for men to recognize women as equals this is everyone 's problem and we all play a role in dismantling systems of inequality for starters we have got to stop telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies this includes not treating pregnant women like community property if you don 't know her don 't even ask to touch her belly this also includes understanding that even if you are personally against abortion you can still if you 're somebody who has sex with women prioritize her pleasure if you don 't know how ask if you have children have conversations about sex as in the dictionary anymore they look it up on the internet and when you 're having those conversations about sex don 't center them on reproduction only people have sex for many reasons some because they want a baby but most of us have sex because it feels good admit it and regardless of whether you have children or not support comprehensive sex education that doesn 't shame our teenagers other than positive std and pregnancy tests every single day we are all given the opportunity to disrupt patterns of inequality thank you"
