  "transcript": "but i always had the sense of being an outsider and it wasn 't until i saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate i thought wow that 's for me you know because there was no coach standing directly over you and these guys they were just being themselves there was no opponent directly across from you and i loved that sense so i started skating when i was about ten years old i picked it up pretty quickly in fact here 's some footage from about it wasn 't until and then by which was amazing to me and in a very real sense that was the mental note on that one and this one here an ollie so as i was about halfway through my pro career in i would say but there there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding where guys were taking it to the streets and they were using that ollie like i showed you they were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff so it was and at that stage i 'd been a champion champion for eleven years which phew that 's it it it was gone they took my pro model off the shelf which was essentially pronouncing you dead publicly that 's how you make your money you know you have a signature board and wheels and the crazy thing was there was a really liberating sense about it because i no longer had to protect my record as a champion always was creating new stuff the other thing that i had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks stuff the normal guys were doing was very much different so as humbling and rotten as it was and believe me it was rotten i would go and again there 's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle the way it grabs it i 'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that and then it dawned on me and here 's part of what i 'm saying i had an infrastructure i had this deep layer it 's just the way you throw your board over just let the ledge do that and it 's easy and the next thing you so that 's the kind of thing here check this out here 's another way and i won 't overdo this a little indulgent i understand there 's something called a primo slide it 's like skimboarding and this one look how it and you take a fall the board slips that way or that way and that 's what i love the most about it it 's so much fun to do in fact when i started doing them i remember because i got hurt i had to get a knee surgery right so there a couple of weeks where i couldn 't skate at all it would give out on me and i would watch the guys i 'd go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating my friends i landed so light footed thinking if my knee gives they 'll just have more work to do in the morning but you are so helpless right you 're on this gurney and you 're watching the ceiling go by and right when they 're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep all i was thinking is man when i wake up and i get better the first thing i 'm going to do is film that trick and indeed i did it was the very first thing i filmed which was awesome in a sense what we do as street skaters is you have these tricks say i 'm working on darkslides or a primo that you guys know this stuff now because you already have something in this fixed domain what will match this trick how can i expand how can the context how can the environment change the very nature of what i do you drive and drive and drive and not only to be here in front of you but what a privilege it is to be at us campus because i have been escorted off of this campus so many times it 's and it 's but there 's this other aspect of it for wheelies so check this out there watch this one oh i love this it 's like surfing this one the way you catch it this one and watch the back foot and and the creative process you check for security you check for stuff and when i hit it the first thing you do is you fall forward and i all of these tricks are made i 'm going to make that next oh mind you those are the community these are some of the best skaters in the world are my friends but a couple of them actually don 't look that that comfortable on their board what makes them great every single one of these guys you look at them you can see a silhouette of them that 's koston there 's these guys these are the guys and i think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of belonging but belonging on their own terms and real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do these basic tricks three hundred and sixty flips we take that we make the summation of that gives us something we could never achieve as an individual say this there 's some sort of beautiful symmetry next these guys very similar community that 's extremely conducive to innovation notice a couple of these shots but it is quite similar i mean what is it to hack right it 's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do you can be an ios hacker make your iphone do stuff it wasn 't supposed to not authorized and they bring it together in a way but it 's at the heart of engineering at the heart of and the open source community the basic ethos of it is take what other people do give it back so we all rise further very similar communities very similar we have our edgier sides too it one of them he was ernst & young 's entrepreneur of the year for san diego county you never know who you 're dealing with we 've all had some degree of fame in fact i 've had so much success that i strangely always feel unworthy of i 've had a patent and that was cool and we started a company and it grew and it became the biggest and then so i 've had some success what is it that will punch you and make you do something and and when you 've had it all sometimes guys they die on the vine with all of that talent one of the things we 've had all of us is fame i think the best kind of fame because you can take it off i 've been all around the world and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name and it 's such a weird visceral experience it 's like it 's disorienting and you get in a car and you drive away and 10 minute drive and you get out and no one gives a rat 's who you are and it gives you that clarity of perspective of not much it 's peer respect that drives us that 's the one thing that makes us do what we do i 've had over a dozen bones this guy over eight ten concussions to the point where it 's comedy right it is actually comedy they mess with him i think i was on tour when i was reading one of the feynman biographies and he made this statement that was so profound to me it was that the the nobel prize was the tombstone on all great work and it and you get into this turtle posture you know that was one of the most liberating things because i could create and look i understand that i am if you guys aren 't already leaders it 's not fame it 's not all these things what it is is that there 's an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it and better than but there is there is this beauty in because that lives on so thank you for your time every time you think you 've chased something down it 's funny no matter how good you are and i know guys like this it feels like you 're polishing a turd you know through a long story one of desperation if i do it rather than talk about it if i do it"
