  "transcript": "i 'm here today to talk to you about a very powerful little word one that people will do almost anything to avoid becoming and those of us who undeniably are it but i 'm fat not the lowercase i 'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous i am the capital i am the elephant in the room when i walked out on stage some of you may have been thinking aww this is going to be hilarious because everybody knows that fat people are funny or you may have been thinking where does she get because a confident fat woman is almost unthinkable the fashion conscious members of the audience may have been thinking how fabulous i look in this beth ditto dress thank you very much whereas some of you might have thought hmm black would have been so much more slimming or if i eat carbs after and that you really should renew your gym membership these judgments are insidious they can be directed at individuals and groups and they can also be directed at ourselves and this way of thinking is known as fatphobia like any form of systematic oppression rooted in complex structures we live in a culture where being fat is seen as being a bad person and we tend to see thinness as being universally good we see these ideas again and again in the media in public health policy doctors ' offices in everyday conversations and in our own attitudes we may even blame fat people themselves easy this antifat bias has become so integral so ingrained to how we value ourselves and each other that we rarely question why we have such contempt for people of size and where that disdain comes from but we must question it and do we really want to live in a society where people are denied their basic humanity if they don 't subscribe to some arbitrary form of acceptable i was about a foot taller and i was going to sparkle i was determined not to be excluded from the performance so i turned to my mother and loud enough for everyone to hear said mom i need a fourfour thanks mom claiming space for myself in that glorious i soon learned that living outside what the mainstream considers normal can be a frustrating and isolating place abused from passing cars and been told that i 'm delusional i also receive smiles from strangers who recognize what it takes to walk down the street with a spring in your step and your head held high and through it all that fierce little six year old has stayed with me and she has helped me stand before you today as an unapologetic fat person a person that simply refuses to subscribe to the dominant narrative about how i should move through the world in this body of mine i am part of an international community of people who choose to rather than passively accepting that our bodies are and probably always will be big we actively choose to flourish in these bodies as they are today people who honor our strength and work with not against our perceived limitations people who value health as something much more holistic we value mental health self worth and how we feel in our bodies as vital aspects to our overall well being people who refuse to believe that living in these fat bodies is a barrier to anything really there are exposing the flesh that we 're all taught to there are fat athletes who run marathons teach yoga or do kickboxing but to be clear i 'm not saying that people shouldn 't change their bodies if that 's what they want to do reclaiming yourself can be one of the most acts of self love and can look like a million different things from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring to hormones to surgery and yes even weight loss my way of engaging in activism and there 's a lot of them inviting other people to join me and then making art about it the common thread through most of this work has been reclaiming spaces that are often prohibitive to bigger bodies from the catwalk to club shows from public swimming pools to prominent dance stages and reclaiming spaces en masse is not only a powerful artistic statement but a radical community building approach this was so true of fem synchronized swim team i started with a group of friends in sydney the impact of seeing a bunch of defiant fat women in flowery swimming caps and bathers throwing their legs in the air without a care should not be underestimated when director kate and i mean literally nothing to lose is a work made in collaboration with performers of size who drew from their lived experiences to create a work as varied and authentic as we all are and it was as far from ballet as you could imagine because nothing like it had ever been done on mainstream dance stages before anywhere in the world people were size twelve full length production but despite the skepticism nothing to lose became a sellout hit of sydney festival we i 've lost count of how many times people of all sizes have told me that the show has changed their lives how it helped them shift their relationship to their own and other people 's bodies and how it made them confront their own bias but of course work i have received violent death threats and abuse for daring to make work that centers fat people 's bodies and lives i 've even been called isis of the obesity epidemic but it also speaks to the panic the literal terror that the fear of fat can evoke which is keeping so many of us from making peace with our own bodies for waiting to be the because the real elephant in the room here is fatphobia fat activism refuses to indulge this fear by advocating for and respect for all of us we can shift society 's reluctance to embrace diversity thank you"
