  "transcript": "one of the things that defines a tedster is you 've taken your passion and you 've turned it into stewardship you actually put action to the issues you care about but what you 're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out so how do you do that and that sort of warped my framework how do you actually work what we need to understand is what drives the political creature and there are two things that are primary in a politician 's heart one is reputation and influence these are the primary tools how about you get on the phone well chances are i 've got a droid who 's picking up the phone yes they called and they said they didn 't like it but it takes some time to build up so what actually works and the answer is rather strange it 's a even the top dog himself takes time every day to read ten letters that are picked out by staff i can tell you that every official that i 've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean you 're going to pick up an analog a pen i know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it second of all i 'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month here 's my promise to you if you are consistent and do this within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say what do you think now i 'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with when you approach these animals and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness so in paragraph number one what i 'm going to tell you to do is very simply this you appreciate them you may not appreciate the person you may not appreciate anything else but maybe you appreciate the fact that they 've got a tough gig when animals are going to make a point they make the point they don 't spend a lot of time dicking around so here you go paragraph number two you may actually have to just get very blunt and say ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere paragraph number three when animals are attacked or cornered they will fight to the death they should take it obviously you 're intelligent if you had the right information you would have done the right thing lastly you want to be the nurturing agent you 're the safe place to come in to so in paragraph number four you 're going to tell people if no one is providing you with this information let me help animals do displays they do two things they warn you or they try to attract you and say we need to mate you do a number of things you 're a vice and that my preservation depends on you you send the original to the district office so if they follow protocol they 'll pick up the phone and say hey do you have the original and political officials are the pinatas we are harangued lectured to sold marketed a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication i got this letter when i was first elected and i still carry it to every council meeting i go to and if you have stewardship you 're going to be the eight hundred pound gorilla in the forest get writing"
