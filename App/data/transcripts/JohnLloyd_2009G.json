  "transcript": "everything i would say everything that matters except every thing as in this cryptic sentence i found in the guardian recently the marriage suffered a setback in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five when the husband was killed by the wife there 's a world of invisibility there isn 't there we can see the stars and the planets but we can 't see what holds them apart or what draws them together with matter as with people we see only the skin of things we can 't see into the engine room we can 't see what makes people tick the more it disappears there isn 't anything there electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz and there is only energy so everything that matters that 's important is invisible the late geoffrey dickens m p was attending a fete in his constituency wherever he went at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness try as he might he couldn 't get away from her horse face i 've misjudged this not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness she turns it to her advantage a photo is not enough so he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in and on the photograph he wrote with a flourish to horse face with love from geoffrey dickens m p after it had been sent off his secretary said to him did you get that letter from the woman at the fete i wrote horse face on her so you 'd remember i bet he thought he wished he was invisible don 't you so one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can 't see we also can 't understand gravity is one thing that we can 't see and which we don 't understand it 's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces and the weakest and nobody really knows what it is or why it 's there for what it 's worth sir isaac newton the greatest scientist who ever lived he thought jesus came to earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity that 's what he thought he was there for could be wrong on that one i don 't know i have no idea what any of you are thinking isn 't that amazing isn 't that incredible that we can 't read each other 's minds but we can but we can 't read each other 's minds i find that quite astonishing so that 's why we don 't think it exists the sufi masters working on us question of consciousness and artificial intelligence artificial intelligence has really like the study of consciousness gotten nowhere we have no idea how consciousness works not only have they not created artificial intelligence they haven 't yet created artificial stupidity remind you of anyone until somebody properly defines the terms and this is increasingly peculiar because they thought it would probably contain around one hundred thousand genes geneticists will know this but every year since it 's been revised downwards because rice and the same as a gorilla you can 't see these things but they are very strange the universe the more light there is the less you can see time nobody can see time i don 't know if you know this modern physics there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn 't really exist because it 's too inconvenient for the figures it 's much and you can 't see the past except in your memory one of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can 't see my son asked me this the other day he said dad can you remember what i was like when i was two and i said yes and he said why can 't i isn 't that extraordinary you cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three which is great news for psychoanalysts because otherwise they 'd be out of a job because that 's where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are you probably know some of you that not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago the question is who then gas you can 't see that interesting somebody mentioned one thousand six hundred recently gas was invented in one thousand six hundred by a dutch chemist called van helmont quite good he also invented a word called blas meaning astral radiation didn 't catch on unfortunately but well done him if a person shines i find that extraordinary not to be able to see light not to be able to see darkness electricity you can 't see that don 't let anyone tell you they understand electricity they don 't nobody knows what it is you probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire don 't you at the speed of light when you turn the light on they don 't electrons bumble down the wire about the of spreading honey they say five out of the one hundred billion galaxies with the naked eye and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you 've got very good eyesight when he discovered radio waves and somebody said to him well what 's the point of these heinrich what 's the point of these radio waves that you 've found and he said well i 've no idea but i guess somebody will find a use for them someday and that 's what they do radio that 's what they what they discovered thomas edison once said we don 't know one percent of one millionth about anything and i 've come to the conclusion because you 've asked this other question what 's another thing you can 't see the point most of us what 's the point you can 't see a point it 's by what i 've got it down to is there are only two questions really worth asking why are we here and what should we do about it while we are and the first is ludwig wittgenstein who said i don 't know but i 'm pretty sure it 's not in order to enjoy ourselves i 've no idea"
