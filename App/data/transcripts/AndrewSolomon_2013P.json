  "transcript": "it is a pathetic little substitute for reality a pitiable flight from life as such it deserves no compassion it deserves no treatment and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness that 's from time magazine in when i was three years the president of the united states came out in favor of gay marriage and my question is how did we get from there to here how did an illness become an identity the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home and i wanted a pink balloon but i said that i definitely wanted but i 'm still gay is evidence of both my mother 's influence and its limits when i was little my mother used to say and until you have children you don 't know what it 's like and when she said it it made me anxious and after i came out of the closet when she continued to and i want you to stop saying that about twenty years ago i was asked by my editors at the new york times magazine to write a piece about deaf culture and i was rather taken aback i had thought of deafness entirely as an illness those poor people they couldn i even went to the miss deaf america contest in nashville tennessee where people complained about that slurry i become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said we don 't lack hearing we have membership in a culture were saying something that was viable it wasn 't my culture and i didn 't particularly want to rush off and join but i appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it it felt as valuable as latino culture or gay culture or jewish culture it felt as valid perhaps even as american culture and when her daughter was born she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me she was facing the question of what to do with this child should she say you 're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity get involved in the little people of america become most gay people are born to straight parents those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world and those gay people have to discover identity later on and here was this friend and i thought there it is again a family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be there are vertical identities which are passed down generationally from parent to child language often religion those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children you can and yet we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of and it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place there 's and a lot of the time people who have these conditions are very angry because they takes time it always takes time one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown and his parents were told that he would never walk he would never talk he would have no intellectual and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the and she took her son home and even though she didn 't have a lot of educational or financial advantages and she got clinton enrolled with him and in the course of his childhood he had thirty major and while he was there they sent tutors around to help him with his school and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family and his mother told me this story of coming home one day and he went to college nearby and she said i saw that car which you can always recognize in the parking lot of a bar she said and i thought to myself and i left him eight messages on his cell phone if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he 'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies and i said to her what do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming accomplished wonderful person and his father and i were lucky enough to be the first to see it there i 'm going to quote from another magazine of the ' 60s this one is from the atlantic monthly voice of liberal america written by an important bioethicist he said there is no reason to feel guilty about putting a down syndrome child away whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium lethal sense but it carries no guilt true guilt arises only from an offense against and a down 's is not a person there 's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we 've made in the treatment of gay people the fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day but we forget how we used to see people who had other differences how we used to see people who were disabled how inhuman we held people to be and the change that 's been accomplished there which is almost equally radical is one that we pay not very much attention to one of the families i interviewed tom and karen robards were taken aback when as young and successful new yorkers their first child was diagnosed with down syndrome they thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be and so they decided they would build a little center two classrooms that they started with a few other parents to educate kids with d s and over the years that center grew into something called the cooke center where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught in the time since that atlantic monthly story ran the life expectancy for people with down syndrome has tripled the robards had a lot to do with that and i said do you regret it do you wish your child didn 't have down syndrome do you wish you 'd never heard of it and interestingly his father but i think if we lost everyone with down syndrome it would be a catastrophic loss but speaking for myself well i would never have believed years ago when he was born that i could come to such a point i wouldn 't give it up for anything in the world we live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never most deaf infants born in the united states now will receive cochlear implants which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech a compound that has been tested in mice and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene grow to full size testing in humans is around the corner there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before making it easier and easier for people to eliminate i believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful and i think the same thing about the medical progress but i think it 's a tragedy when one of them doesn 't see the other and when i see the way i sometimes think it 's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan and a lot of the time the question of parenthood is what do we validate in our ' i wish my child did not have autism ' ' i wish the child i have did not exist and i had a different non autistic child instead ' this is what we hear when you mourn over our existence this is what we hear when you pray for a cure that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces it 's a very extreme point of view but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don 't want to be cured or changed or eliminated they want to be whoever it is that they 've come to be one of the families i interviewed it took a long time to persuade them to talk to me and once they agreed they were so full of their story that they couldn 't stop telling it and the first weekend i spent with them the first of many i recorded more than twenty hours of conversation and on sunday night we were all exhausted we were sitting in the kitchen sue klebold was fixing dinner and i said if dylan were here now do you have a sense of what you 'd want to ask him and his father said i sure do i 'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing and then she looked back up and said i would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head when i had dinner with her a couple of years later one of many dinners that we had together she said you know when it first happened i used to wish that i had never married that i had never had children if i hadn 't gone to ohio state and crossed paths with tom but i 've come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don 't want to there is she said so while i recognize that it would have been better for the world if dylan had never been born i thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting and then i thought all of us who have children love the children we have with their flaws if some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children i have and give me other better smarter i would cling to the children i have and pray away that atrocious spectacle and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won 't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think where did you come from it turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia there are only so many families of children who there are only so many families of prodigies who also face similar challenges in many ways there are only so many families in each of those categories but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating ironically it turns out that it 's our differences and our negotiation of difference that unite us i decided to have children while i was working on this project and many people were astonished and said but how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong and i said i 'm not studying everything that can go wrong what i 'm studying is how much love there can be even when everything appears to be going i thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child i had seen a and when his ashes were interred his mother said once of the child i wanted and once of the son i loved and i figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so i had a close friend from college who 'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children and so she and i have a daughter and mother and daughter live in texas and my husband and i have a son who lives with us all the lesbian mother of oliver and lucy in minneapolis so the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states and there are people who think that families like mine shouldn 't be allowed to exist and i don 't accept subtractive models of love and i believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on so we need this he wasn 't extending his legs appropriately she said that might mean that he had brain damage which she thought and i thought here i had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of and like all parents since the dawn of time and yet i knew from the work i had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for that those would and at the end of five hours they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly and when i asked the pediatrician what had been going on she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp i thought the love you have for your children and until you have children you don 't know what it feels like but i 'm not sure i would have noticed that if i hadn 't been so in the thick of this research project of mine and i fell very naturally enslaving themselves to a lifetime 's journey with their thankless children i realized that day that my research had built me a plank and that i was ready to join them on their ship thank you"
