  "transcript": "talk today about saving more but not today tomorrow i 'm going to talk about save more tomorrow it 's a program that richard thaler from the university of chicago and i devised maybe fifteen years ago the program in a sense is an example of behavioral finance on steroids let 's start with mortgages it 's kind of a recent topic at least in the u s a lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford and and then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages let 's also think about how we manage risks we were risk takers of course they feel emotionally they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up so we how many of you have iphones i would bet many more of you insure your iphone what if you lose your iphone what if you do this how many of you have kids anyone keep your hands up if you have sufficient life insurance i see a lot of hands coming down i would if you 're a representative sample that many more of you insure your iphones the average american household and i know it sounds crazy so that tells us that the people not in this room are spending more than a thousand to get the average to a thousand low income people so where does it take us we 're not doing a great job managing money behavioral finance is really a combination of psychology trying to understand the money mistakes people make and i can keep standing here for the twelve minutes and fifty three seconds that i have left and at the end you 're going to ask and then turning the behavioral challenges and what i 'm going to talk about today is save more tomorrow i want to address the issue of savings we have on the screen and we 're going to look at their first thing to notice is half of them they cannot have money go away from their paycheck into a four hundred and one plan before they see it before they can what about the remaining half of the people some of them elect not to save and then they have to decide how they one third of americans two thirds are not saving now are they saving enough take out those who say they save too little one out of ten are saving enough nine out of ten either cannot save through their four hundred and one plan decide not to save or don 't decide let 's look at that we have one person well actually we 're going to slice him in half roughly half a percent of americans feel that they save too much and then see how powerful it might be so let me divert for a second as we 're going to identify the the behavioral challenges that prevent people from saving i suppose we had another wonderful ted event next week how many of you think you would like to have bananas during this hypothetical ted event next week who would go for bananas and then count down the days and see what people ended up eating the same people that imagined themselves eating the is not a problem it 's only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us what does it have to do with with time and savings this issue of immediate gratification we think about saving we know we should be saving we know we 'll do it next year but today let us go and spend christmas is coming we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know so this issue of present bias causes us to think about saving but end up spending let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia but again a little diversion to the topic of organ and in germany if you would like to donate your organs god forbid something really bad happens to you when you get your driving license or an i d you check the box i would like to donate my organs not many people like checking boxes it takes effort you need to think twelve percent do slightly different what 's the difference you will decide whether you want to donate your organs or not but when you get your driving license you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ what are the implications to saving lives and having organs huge shortage of organs god forbid if you need one if they keep procrastinating if they don 't check the boxes very powerful 're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their four hundred and one choices are we going to make them automatically join the plan it means they 're not saving for retirement if they don 't check the box and checking the box so we 've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges one more before we flip the challenges into solutions having to do with monkeys and apples no no no this is a real study and it 's got a lot to do with behavioral economics the other group gets two apples one is taken away they still have an apple left they 're really mad this is the notion of loss aversion even if it doesn 't mean a lot of risk it 's very painful so this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too so we talked about all sorts of behavioral challenges having to do with it 's a lot more fun to spend now we talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box if people frame mentally and what richard thaler and i were always fascinated by take behavioral finance make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance two point zero or behavioral finance in action and we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution called save more not today tomorrow we think we 're going to eat we think we 're going to save more next year save more tomorrow invites employees to save more maybe next year sometime in the future exercising more and doing all the right things on the about checking the box and the difficulty of taking action save more tomorrow let 's say every january you 're going to be saving more automatically and it 's going to go away from your paycheck to the four hundred and one plan before you see it before you touch it but what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion next january comes and people might feel that if they save more they have to spend less and that 's painful maybe it shouldn 't be just january maybe we should make people save more when they make more money that way when they make more money when they get a pay raise they don 't have to cut their so that is the program embarrassingly but as we 're going to see extremely powerful we first implemented it richard thaler and i back in one thousand nine company in the midwest blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away saving more we invited them to save three percentage points more and here are the results we 're seeing here a three and a half year period four pay raises people who were struggling to save were saving three percent of their paycheck three and a half years later saving almost four times as much almost fourteen percent and there 's shoes and bicycles and things on this chart because i don 't want to just throw numbers in a vacuum i want really to think about the fact that saving four times more whereas with saving three percent people might have to add nice sneakers so they can walk because they won 't be able to afford anything else when they save fourteen percent they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes to walk to the car to drive this is a real difference by now about sixty percent of the large companies actually have programs like this in place it 's been part of the pension protection act and needless to say that thaler and i have been blessed to be part of let me wrap with with two key messages one is behavioral finance is this is just one example message two is there 's still a lot to do if you think about people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it we need to think about that if you 're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they 're taking or taking too little risk we need to think about that if you the record is in singapore the average household spends $ four thousand a year we 've got a lot to do a lot to solve also in the retirement area when it comes to what how many of you feel comfortable that as you 're planning for retirement you have a really solid plan what lifestyle to expect how many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future when it comes to post retirement decisions one two three four less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience behavioral finance has a long way there 's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again thank you"
