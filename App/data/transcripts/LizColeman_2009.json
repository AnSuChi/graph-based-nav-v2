  "transcript": "college presidents are not the first people who come to mind the story begins in the late ' i was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free eastern europe and russia since education under the soviet union was essentially propaganda they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations given this rare opportunity to start fresh they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students ' broadest intellectual and deepest ethical potential home of liberal arts education to talk with some of us most closely identified with that kind of education they spoke with a passion an urgency an intellectual conviction that for me was a voice i had not heard in decades a dream long forgotten we had moved light years but for me and what was written liberal arts education no longer exists at least genuine liberal arts education in this country we have professionalized liberal arts to the point where they no longer provide the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement over the past century the expert has dethroned the educated generalist to become the sole model of intellectual accomplishment expertise but the price of its dominance is enormous we have even managed to make the study of literature arcane you may think you know what is going on in that jane austen novel that is until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism the progression of today 's college student is to jettison every interest except one and within that one to continually narrow the focus learning more and more about less and less lest you think i exaggerate here are the beginnings of the a b cs of anthropology what kind of a world can we be making and move off the table in so doing the guardians of secular democracy in effect yield the connection between education and values to fundamentalists who you can be sure have no compunctions about using education to further their values the absolutes either we have lost touch with those values or no better believe they need not or cannot be taught but despite the attention paid to these efforts they remain emphatically extracurricular in effect is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes simply put when the impulse is to change the world the academy is more likely to engender a learned helplessness than to create a sense of empowerment this brew oversimplification of civic engagement idealization of the expert fragmentation of knowledge emphasis on technical mastery neutrality as a condition of academic integrity is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections between education and the public good between intellectual integrity and human freedom which were at the heart of the challenge posed to and by my european colleagues when the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough i can assure you to give one pause whether it was threats to the environment we were in desperate straits and that was only the beginning nothing was exempt the relationship of church and state accompanied by a squandering of the nation 's material wealth that defied credulity a harrowing predilection for the uses of force had become commonplace with an equal distaste for the alternative forms of influence at the same time all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda once a model for the world despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world more than half of the american public don 't believe in evolution and don 't press your luck about how much those who do believe in it actually understand it this nation equally startling from my point of view is the fact that no one we may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth we are not even on the list when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy we are playing with fire you can be sure jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be this betrayal of our principles our decency our hope made it impossible for me to avoid the question what will i say years from now when people ask ' where were you ' so the conversation began at bennington knowing that if we were to regain the integrity of liberal education it would take enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective the accomplishment of civic virtue is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination at their most challenging our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them but the balances redressed our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance the idea is to make the challenges themselves from health and education to the uses of force the organizers of the curriculum they would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines rather than divide rather than isolating triangles but as frameworks of action the challenge to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking the importance of coming to grips with values like justice truth becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they the value of the past also comes alive it provides a lot of company you are not the first to try to figure this out just as you are unlikely to be the last even more valuable history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual as well as the intended consequences of ideas in the language of my students deep thought matters when you 're contemplating what to do about things that matter a new liberal quantitative reasoning attains its proper position at the heart of what it takes to manage change where measurement is crucial as is a capacity to discriminate the power of technology emerges with special intensity but so does the importance of content the more important the question about what when strategies of action are in the process of being designed in this dramatically expanded ideal of a liberal arts education where the continuum of thought and action is its life 's blood knowledge honed outside the academy becomes essential lawyers politicians professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good in turn continuously move outside the classroom to engage the world directly and of course this new wine needs new bottles if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism of this idea the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action but between this discovery is transforming it undercuts self righteousness radically alters the tone and character of controversy and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground unsubstantiated opinions simply won 't do this is a political education but it is a politics of principle not of partisanship so the challenge for bennington is to do it on the cover of bennington 's two thousand and eight holiday card is the architect 's sketch of a building opening in two thousand and ten that is to be a center for the advancement of public action the center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment think of it as a kind of secular church faculty and staff to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time the glacial silence we have experienced in the face of the shredding of the constitution the unraveling of our public we the people beyond waiting another four years we persist also in being sidelined by the idea of the expert as the only one capable of coming up with answers despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary the problem is there is no such thing as a viable democracy made up of experts but this will not yield the flexibilities of mind the capacities for collaboration and innovation this country needs that is where you come in what is certain contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone if the question of where to start seems overwhelming you are at the beginning not the end of this adventure being overwhelmed is the first step so what do you do when you feel overwhelmed and you have other people start with those and change the world"
