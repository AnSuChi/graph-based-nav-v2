  "transcript": "i grew up with my identical twin who was an incredibly loving brother now one thing about being a twin is it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism if his cookie and clearly i wasn 't starving and that is how much more we value the body than we do the mind i spent nine years at university so not a real doctor as if it should say that on my card i recently was at a friend 's house and he cried for a minute but then he got back up got back on the stool and reached out for a box of to put one on his cut now but he knew you have to cover a cut so it doesn 't become infected and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day right we 've known it since we were five years old but what do we know about maintaining our psychological health nothing how is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth than we do our minds why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones injuries like failure and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways and yet even though there are scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries it doesn 't even occur to us that we should oh you 're feeling depressed just shake it off it 's all in your head can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg oh just walk it off it 's all in your leg it is time we closed the gap between our physical and our psychological time we made them more equal so he 's not a real doctor either the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life we were apart then for the first time we missed each other terribly but international phone calls were really expensive then and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week when our birthday rolled around it was the first we wouldn 't be spending together we we would talk for ten minutes i spent the morning pacing around my room waiting for him to call and waiting given the time difference i assumed ok he 's out with friends he 'll call later there were no cell he no longer missed me the way i missed him i knew he would call in the morning but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life i glanced down at the phone and i realized i had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before and boy was he pissed laughter it was the saddest and longest night of his life as well now i tried to explain what happened but he said i don 't understand if you saw i wasn 't calling you why didn 't you just pick up the phone and call me and it 's a simple one loneliness loneliness creates a deep psychological wound it makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do it make us really afraid to reach out because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand i was in the grips of real loneliness back then but but loneliness is defined purely subjectively there is a lot of research on loneliness and all of it is horrifying loneliness won 't just make you miserable it will kill you i 'm not fourteen percent making you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases chronic loneliness poses as significant a risk for your cigarette packs come with warnings saying this could kill you but loneliness doesn 't because you can 't treat a psychological wound if you don 't even know you 're injured loneliness isn 't the only psychological wound that distorts our perceptions and misleads us failure and a cute doggie would pop out then pushing it and then she just sat back and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling the little boy next to her watched this happen then turned to his box and burst into tears without even touching it meanwhile another little girl tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button the cute doggie popped out and she squealed with delight so three toddlers with identical the only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind adults get tricked this way as well all and you believe it then like those two toddlers you 'll begin to feel helpless and you 'll stop trying too soon or you won 't even try at all and then you 'll be even more convinced you can 't succeed and they believed it once we become convinced of something it 's very difficult to change our mind i learned that lesson the hard way when i was a teenager with my brother we were driving with friends down a and shined his flashlight on the driver and his eyes opened wide and he said where have i seen your face before but that made no sense to him whatsoever so now he thought i was on drugs and only when he verified i didn 't have a police record could i show him i had a twin in the front even as we were driving away you could see by the look on his face he was convinced that i was getting away with something but you cannot you have to fight feelings of you have to gain control over the situation and you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins [ stop emotional bleeding ] our minds and our feelings they 're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were they 're more like a really moody friend who can be totally supportive one minute i once worked with this woman who after twenty years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce was finally ready for her first date she had met this guy online and he seemed nice and he seemed successful and most importantly he seemed really into her so she was very excited she bought a new dress and they met at an upscale new york city bar for a drink ten minutes into the date the man stands up and says i 'm not interested and walks out rejection is extremely painful the woman was so hurt she couldn 't move all she could do was call a friend here 's what the friend said what do you expect why would a handsome successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you but it would be much less shocking if i told you it wasn 't the friend who said that it but we all do it 's interesting that we do because why would we want to go and damage it even further we wouldn 't make a physical injury worse on purpose you wouldn 't get a cut on your arm and decide oh i know i 'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper i can make it but we do that with psychological injuries and it takes longer to recover from them so when you get rejected the first thing you should be doing is to revive your join fight club and beat it into a pulp when you 're in emotional pain treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend [ protect your self esteem ] and one of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination to ruminate means to chew over it 's when your boss yells at you or your professor makes you feel stupid in class or you have big fight with a friend sometimes for weeks on end and it 's a very costly one you are actually putting yourself at significant risk the problem is the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important so it 's a difficult habit to stop i developed the habit you see my twin brother was diagnosed with stage three non hodgkin 's lymphoma his cancer was extremely aggressive he had visible tumors all over his body i couldn 't stop thinking about how much he was suffering even though he never complained two minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in and so each time i had a worrying upsetting negative thought i forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful [ battle negative thinking ] and i was by his side when he got the results all the tumors were gone he still had three more rounds of chemotherapy to go but we knew he would recover this picture was taken two weeks ago by taking action when you 're lonely by changing your responses to failure by protecting you won 't just heal your psychological wounds you will thrive i believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier if there were less loneliness and less depression if people knew how to overcome failure if they felt better about themselves and more empowered if they were happier and more fulfilled and that 's the world my brother wants to live in as well and if you just become informed and change a few simple habits well that 's the world we can all live in thank you very much"
