  "transcript": "god gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time i think how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in eighteen minutes be quite a challenge for me they talk about famine hiv and aids poverty or war but my story that i would like to share with you today is the one about success it is about a country in the southwest of africa called namibia namibia i come from a region in the remote northwest part of the country it 's called kunene region and in the center of kunene region is the village of sesfontein this is where i was born this is where i 'm coming from most people that are following the story of angelina jolie and brad pitt will know where namibia is they love namibia for its beautiful dunes wind and time have twisted our landscape into very and these shapes are speckled with wildlife that has become so adapted to this harsh and strange land i 'm a himba you might wonder why are you wearing these western clothes i 'm we live a very traditional lifestyle i want you to become if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat and he will let go of the goat and run off if you run into a lion stand your imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after in this way in addition to being an ordinary namibian and in addition to being a himba i 'm also a trained conservationist and it is very important if you are in the field to know what to confront and as a result we were fined and and soviet interests and the army hunted for valuable rhino horns they could sell these things for anything between it killed almost everything that was left our livestock was was i remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed it 's a very sad story but even today that memory is still in people 's minds they can pinpoint the exact location where almost lost everything and my father said why don 't you just go to school and they sent me off to school just to get busy somewhere there they actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities they were trusted by the local communities poaching death and despair surrounded joshua proposed to joshua what if we pay people that you trust or people that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well instead of shooting poachers dead like they were doing elsewhere in africa irdnc has helped helped men reclaim their abilities to manage their peoples and their rights to own and people started feeling ownership over wildlife wildlife numbers started coming back and that 's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia with independence the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government here is our tradition the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and i think this is the best way of regulating ourselves on the environment transporting rhinos using helicopters i think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can 't see isn 't it we learned these things from outsiders we needed new boundaries to describe our we needed to learn more things like gps just to see whether can gps really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere and we we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world and we maintained honoring our the second element is that we wanted to have a life a better life where we can benefit through many things most poachers like my father were people from our own community they were not people from outside these were our own people they were treated with respect back into the communities the best one like my father i 'm not campaigning for my father and and that was a very the last element that actually helped develop these things was the partnerships business communities helped bring namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very and most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in namibia have been trained through the initiative through the involvement of world wildlife fund up to date conservation practices they have also given funding for two decades to this whole program or sesfontein thirty years have passed since father 's first job as a community game guard it 's very unfortunate that he passed away when i finished school in there are more than one hundred and thirty lions don 't walk out at night the black rhino they were almost extinct in because the natural plain has multiplied springboks and everything they stay very much far away this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals what started as very small community rangers getting community involved has now grown into something that we call conservancies conservancies are legally and these are run by the communities themselves for their benefit today we have got sixty conservancies we have already reshaped conservation in the conservancy generated five point seven million dollars this is our new food very important and this is the good news from africa that we have to shout from the rooftops and now what to help me and our partners take some of what we have learned in namibia to other places with similar problems places like mongolia the northern great plains where buffalo and other animals have suffered i like that one namibia serving as a model to africa and africa serving as a model to the united states we were successful in namibia because we knew conservation would fail if to improve the lives of the local communities so come and talk to me about namibia do visit our website to learn more and see how you can help cbnrm thank you very much"
