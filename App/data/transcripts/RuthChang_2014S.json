  "transcript": "hard choice you 'll face in the near future it might be between two careers artist and accountant or places to live the city or the country or even between two people to marry you could marry betty or you could marry lolita or it might be a choice about chances are the hard choice you thought of was something big something momentous something that matters to you hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing hand wringing the gnashing of teeth understanding hard choices uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses and neither is better than the other overall you agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country we shouldn 't think that all hard choices are big let 's say you 're deciding what to have for breakfast you could have high fiber bran cereal suppose what matters in the choice is tastiness and healthfulness realizing that small choices can also be hard may make big hard choices seem less intractable we also shouldn 't think that hard choices are hard because we are stupid i really loved philosophy but i came from a modest immigrant family so the thought of spending my whole life sitting around in armchairs just thinking well and i tried my best to think of the reasons for and against each alternative if only god or netflix would send me a i 'd see that one was better and the choice would be easy i took the safest fear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer and i study hard choices that fear of the unknown while a common motivational default rests on a misconception of them even taking two alternatives side by side with full information a choice can still be hard hard choices are hard not because of if the scales don 't tip in favor of one alternative so maybe the right thing to say in hard choices is that they 're between equally good options but and it seems a mistake to think here 's how you suppose you have a choice between two jobs you could be an investment banker or a graphic artist there are a variety of things that matter in such a choice like the excitement of the work achieving financial security having time to raise a family and so on maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of financial manipulation so that neither is better than the other wooing you does the extra money now make the banking job better than the artist one but it might not that 's not the case with options in hard choices so now we 've got a puzzle something seems to have gone wrong here and comparison is impossible it 's not like we 're trying to choose between two things that can 't be compared we 're weighing the merits of two jobs after all not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs a comparison of the overall merits of two jobs is something we can make and one we often do make i think the puzzle arises because of an unreflective assumption we make about value we unwittingly assume that values like justice beauty kindness are akin to scientific quantities like length mass and weight such as which of two suitcases is heavier lesser or equal to the weight of the other properties like weight can be represented by real numbers one two three and so on and there are only three possible comparisons between any two real numbers we tend to assume that scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world the stuff of the other world can 't we shouldn 't assume that the world of is of lengths and weights has the same structure as the world of ought of what we should do the love you have for your partner can 't be represented by real numbers there are only three possibilities we need to introduce a new fourth relation worse or equal but one alternative isn 't better than the other understanding hard choices in this way uncovers something about ourselves we didn 't know imagine a world in which every choice you that is there 's always a best alternative because part of being rational is doing the better thing rather than the worse thing choosing what you have most reason to choose in such a world we 'd have most reason to wear black socks instead of pink socks to eat cereal instead of donuts to live in the city rather than the country to marry betty instead of lolita a world full of only easy choices would enslave us to reasons when you think about it it 's nuts to believe that the reasons given to you dictated that you had most reason to pursue the exact hobbies you do instead you faced alternatives that were on a par hard choices and you made reasons for yourself that house and that job the reasons given to us the ones that determine whether we 're making a mistake are silent as to what to do that we get to exercise our normative power the power to create reasons for yourself to make yourself into the kind of person for whom country living is preferable to the urban life i am for chocolate donuts this response in hard choices is a rational response when we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that we wholeheartedly become the people that we are you might say that we become the authors of our own lives instead of looking for reasons out there we should be looking for reasons in here who am i to be you might decide to be a pink what we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us we all know drifters allow the world to write the story of their lives they let mechanisms of reward and punishment so the lesson of hard on what you can put your agency behind on what you can be for far from being sources of agony and dread hard choices are precious opportunities for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect sometimes run out that we have the power to create reasons for ourselves to become the distinctive people that we are and that 's why hard choices are not a curse but a godsend"
