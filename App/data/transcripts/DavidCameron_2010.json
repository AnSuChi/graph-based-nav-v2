  "transcript": "the other thing to think of is what an honor it is as a politician to give a ted talk politics with the expenses scandal has sunk so low there was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians and someone asked why and they said well there 's no shortage of politicians no one really minds what happens to them and after all there are some things that rats just won 't do data rich slide this i think is the most important fact to bear in mind in we have vast budget deficits this is my global public i think what this leads to is a very simple recognition that there 's one question in politics at the moment above all other and it 's this one because there isn 't going to be a lot of money to improve public services or to improve government or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about so what follows from that is that if you think think it 's all about money you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money you can only measure progress by spending money you 're going to have a pretty miserable time but if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being things like your family relationships friendship community values then actually this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics and the really simple argument i want to make tonight the really straightforward argument is this that if we combine the right political philosophy the right political thinking with the incredible information revolution that has taken place and that all of you know so much more about than and achieve what 's up on that slide which is a big increase in our well being that 's the argument i want to make tonight so starting with now i 'm not saying for a minute that british conservatives have all the answers of course we don 't but there are two things at heart that i think drive a conservative philosophy that are really the first is this we believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives if you give people more choice if you put them in the driving seat and if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today i think you can completely as i 've said remake politics remake government remake your public services the second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are rather than as they would like them to be now if you combine this very simple very conservative thought go with the grain of human nature with all the advances in behavioral economics some of which we condensed history lesson about what i would say are the the bureaucratic age and what we now live in which i think is a age a simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control then we went to a world of central control and now we 're in a world of people control now while it still took there wasn 't much you were in charge of you weren 't in charge of policing justice education health welfare you could just about go to war and that was about it this was the pre bureaucratic age an age in which everything had to be local the bureaucratic age and hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully there we are central state it was able it was able to do the next great stage which all of you are so familiar with the massive information revolution just consider this one fact sending these ten words cost fifty dollars right now here we are linked up to long beach and everywhere else and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without what does this mean for our politics for our public services for our government but let me just give and this is so obvious in a way because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop the way we travel the way that business is done that is already happened the information and internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways but it hasn 't in every way yet touched our government so how could this happen in transparency if we take transparency here is one of my favorite websites the missouri accountability portal in the old days only the government could hold the information and only a few elected people could try and grab that information and question it and challenge it now here on one one state in america every single dollar spent by that government is searchable is analyzable is checkable think of the huge change that means any business that wants to bid for a government contract can see what currently is being spent anyone thinking i could do that service better i could deliver it cheaper it 's all available there we have only in government started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution we 're going to make every contract we 're announcing this today but also huge increases choice now you all and you 're going to see this change massively we should making this change with the information revolution in our country with searchable health sites so you can see what operations work out properly what records doctors have the cleanliness of hospitals and the third of these big changes accountability this i think is a huge change it is a crime map this is a crime map from chicago and we have to suddenly we 've got this vast opportunity for people power where we as citizens can see what crimes are being committed where when and by whom and we can hold the and you can see this looks a bit like a chef 's hat but actually that 's an assault the one in blue accountability now i also said the other principle that i think we should work on is understanding of people is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more now we 're got a huge we 're working with some of these people we 're being advised by some of these people as was said to try and bring all the experience to book let me just give you one example that i think is incredibly simple and i love we want to get people to be more energy efficient why we even had one government minister once told us to brush our teeth in the dark i don 't think they lasted very long look at what this does this is a simple piece of behavioral economics the best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending that sort of behavioral economics can transform people 's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve other examples are recycling we all know we need to recycle more how do we make it happen so what does all this add up to here are my two favorite u s speeches of of the last fifty here we have jfk with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country an incredibly noble sentiment you could serve in your country 's civil service but you didn 't really and i think an even more wonderful speech which i 'm going to read a big chunk of and it is robert kennedy 's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little it does not allow for the health of our except but now with the huge advances in information with the massive changes in behavioral economics with all that we know about how you advance well being that if we combine those insights while at the same time understanding why people behave in the way they do it is a dream more easy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech forty years ago"
