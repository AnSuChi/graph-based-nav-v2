  "transcript": "i 'd like to tell you about two games of chess a machine to many this was the dawn of a new era one where man would be dominated by machine but here we are twenty years on the second game was a freestyle chess tournament rather than adversaries if they so chose who won won not a grandmaster with a supercomputer but actually two american amateurs using three relatively weak laptops their ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters and the superior computational power of other adversaries instead it 's about cooperation and the right type of cooperation we 've been paying a lot of attention to marvin minsky 's vision for artificial intelligence over the last fifty years it 's a sexy vision for sure many have embraced it it 's become the dominant school of thought in computer but as we enter the era of big data of network systems of open platforms and embedded technology i 'd like to suggest it 's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time perhaps better termed intelligence augmentation i a licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs note that word cooperate licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it data from star trek but to take a human and make her more capable humans are so amazing how we think our creativity iterative hypotheses all very difficult if possible at all for computers to do determining the criteria and performing the evaluation of course in other ways humans are so limited we 're terrible at scale computation and volume we require high end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making silently without much fanfare this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess protein folding a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe this is a world changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease a game created by computer scientists illustrates the value of the approach allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues this approach beat supercomputers fifty percent of the time foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game last year on the site of the twin towers the nine eleven memorial opened it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called meaningful adjacency it places the names next to each other based on their relationships to one another friends the importance of the overall physical specifications and the final aesthetics the truth is a bit more nuanced while an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework humans used that framework to design the final result so in this case a computer had evaluated millions of allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices whether it 's augmented reality in your iphone or gps in your car human computer symbiosis is making us more capable so if you want to improve human computer symbiosis what can you do you can start by designing the human into the process specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction in fact this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall that 's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster what kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction the better the process the less the friction and minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable the major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on how do i store this data how do i search this data how do i process this data when paypal was first starting as their biggest challenge was not how do i send money back and forth online it was how do i do that without being defrauded by organized crime entrepreneurial spirit and one huge and important difference purpose and so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure they rarely if ever present with a repeatable pattern that 's discernable to computers instead there 's some inherent component of innovation or disruption and increasingly these problems are buried in big data and despite what you might see on tv these adaptations and the detection of them are fundamentally human searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them osama bin laden was not caught by artificial intelligence he was caught by dedicated resourceful brilliant people in partnerships with various as appealing as it might sound you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer there is no find terrorist button and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems the less effective data mining can be instead people will have to look at data the key to great results here is the right type of and as kasparov realized that means minimizing friction at the interface identifying key relationships and putting them in one place something that 's been nearly impossible to do before to some this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance that must be acknowledged and they can 't be swept aside even with the best of intents so let 's explore through a couple of examples the impact that technologies built to drive human computer symbiosis have had in recent time in october two thousand and seven u s and coalition forces raided an al qaeda safe house in the city of sinjar on the syrian border of iraq they found a treasure trove of documents seven hundred biographical sketches of foreign fighters these foreign fighters had left their families in the gulf these records were human resource forms the foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization it turns out that al qaeda too is not without its bureaucracy laughter they answered questions like who recruited you what 's your hometown what occupation do you seek in that last question a surprising insight was revealed the vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom analyzing this data was hard the originals were sheets of paper in arabic that had to be scanned and translated the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans pdfs and tenacity alone the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper to explore hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at three percent it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in al qaeda a senior cleric in the libyan islamic fighting group in march of two thousand and seven he gave a speech after which there was a surge in participation amongst libyan foreign fighters perhaps most clever of all though and least obvious by flipping the data on its head the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border these were networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit for example they charged saudi foreign fighters substantially more than libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al qaeda the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they cheating would be jihadists third deadliest earthquake of all time left one million people ten percent of the population homeless one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started january and february are the dry months in haiti yet many of the camps had developed standing water the only institution with detailed knowledge of haiti 's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake leadership inside so the question is which camps are at risk how many people are in these camps what 's the timeline for flooding and given very limited resources and infrastructure how do we prioritize the relocation the data was incredibly disparate the u s army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country there was data online from a two thousand and six environmental risk conference other geospatial data none of it integrated the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need social media data and relief organization information to answer this question by implementing a superior process what was otherwise a task for man and machine"
