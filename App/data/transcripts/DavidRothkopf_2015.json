  "transcript": "what i 'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear and the cost of fear and the age of fear from which we are now emerging i would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that that i know something about fear and anxiety i 'm a jewish guy from new jersey i could worry before i could walk applaud that thank you but i also grew up in a time where there was something to fear we were brought out in the hall when i was a little kid and taught how to put our coats over our heads to protect us from global thermonuclear war but i also knew that global thermonuclear war was something and yet despite the fact that we lived for fifty years the response of our government and of our society we created the space program in response to that we built our highway system in response to that we created the internet in response to that un constructive response they exacted a horrible toll it is not for us to minimize what that toll was the response that we had was clearly disproportionate disproportionate to the point of we rearranged the national security apparatus of the united states and of many governments to address a threat that at the time that those attacks took place two thousand and one there were one hundred members of core al qaeda they posed an existential threat but we rearranged our entire national security apparatus in the most sweeping way since the end of the second we violated international law we embraced torture we embraced the idea that if these nineteen guys could do this anybody could do it and what was the result of that surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls of entire countries hundreds of millions of people setting aside whether those countries were our allies setting aside what our interests were since today there are more terrorists more terrorist attacks more terrorist casualties this by the count of state department since today the region from which those attacks emanate is more unstable than at any time in its history since perhaps we have not succeeded in our response now you have to ask where did we go wrong what did we do what was the mistake that was made and you might say well look washington is a dysfunctional but there are bigger problems believe it or not than that dysfunction even though i would argue that dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done in the richest and most powerful country in the world is far more dangerous than anything that a group like isis could do because it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us in think tanks where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas you don 't get bold new ideas because if you offer up a bold new idea not only are you attacked on twitter but you will not get confirmed in a government job tiny groups of people making decisions when you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions what do you get danger and so the parts of the u s government that do foresight that look forward that do strategy we are still looking in the wrong direction and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon that are far more important far more important even than instability that we 've got in some areas of the world well to a group like you we are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society is being rewoven if you saw the cover of the economist a couple of days ago it said that eighty percent of the people on the planet by the year two thousand and twenty in most of africa the cell phone penetration rate is eighty percent we passed the point last october when there were more mobile cellular devices sim cards we are within years of a profound moment in our history single human being on the planet is going to be part of a man made system for the first time able to touch anyone else and the changes associated with that are changing the very nature of every aspect of governance and life on the planet in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking we 've come out of a cold war in which it was and so we didn 't to a period that i call cool war cyber war where the costs of conflict are actually so low that we may never stop we may enter a period of constant warfare we don 't know if somebody launches a cyber attack how do we deter them when china launched a series of cyber attacks what did the u s government do it said we 're going to indict a few of these chinese guys who are never coming to america they 're never going to be anywhere near special forces operators out there in the field today discover that small groups of insurgents with cell phones have access to satellite imagery that once only superpowers had if you 've got a cell phone you 've got access to power that a superpower didn 't have and would have highly classified ten years ago in my cell phone i have an app that tells me where every plane they have apps that allow them to know what their adversary is about to do they 're using these tools in new ways because he captured people he terrorized them he pointed the ipad at them the relations between great powers we thought we were past but we 're not we 're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the internet that it was going to connect us weave society together you 've got countries saying no if the internet happens within our borders we control it within our borders we control the it 's singapore it 's brazil after the nsa and so all of a sudden what do you have you have a new bipolar world in which our belief is challenged by we are seeing these changes everywhere where millions of people who haven 't had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones there are two point five million people who don 't have financial service access that are going to get it soon a billion of them are going to have the ability to access it on their cell we are debating whether to call the terrorist group that has taken over syria and iraq we are trying to determine when in fact we know that the iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us and we 're ignoring it partially because businesses are not and that gets us to another breakdown that 's crucial and another breakdown that couldn 't be more important to a group like this because the growth of america and real american national security and all of the things that drove progress even during the cold war partnership between science technology and government but it was the canals and railroads and telegraph it was radar and the internet it was tang the breakfast drink probably not the most important of those developments every time anyone has waged a war on science science has won they were expected to speak throw weight if you went to the highest level of the u s government now and said talk to me about cyber about the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow you 'd get a blank stare i know because when i wrote this book i talked to one hundred and fifty people many from the science and tech side who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids ' table we have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things but they started but the world 's coming apart all of a sudden there are going to be massive regulatory changes and massive issues associated with conflict and massive issues associated with security and can 't vote if you can 't have a job if you can 't bank if you can 't get health care if you can 't be educated without internet access is internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions if internet access is a fundamental right is electricity access for the one point two billion who don 't have access to electricity a fundamental right these are fundamental issues pity me the dialogue isn 't happening there create only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government both sides need each other then we are going to grow ever more vulnerable the risks associated with nine eleven will not be measured in terms of lives lost by terror attacks or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent they 'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues and our inability to get together technologists government leaders at a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the renaissance and that 's why i believe thank you very very"
