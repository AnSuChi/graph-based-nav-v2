  "transcript": "what does it look like come with me to nine hundred and fifteen south bloodworth street in raleigh north where i grew up if you come in you will see us evening time at table set for ten but not always all seats filled sometimes she said she couldn 't tell who was who and where they were before we could put it in the oven when something significant had happened for any one of us had just been elected as the president of the pta or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent the ritual at the family was once the announcement is made we must take five ten minutes to do what we call that person for when one is honored we had to make a report on our extended visited members that sick and elderly shut in my task was at least once a week to visit mother lassiter who lived to be family is to care and share and to look out for one another they are our family and of course sometimes there was a bonus for going they would offer sweets or money mom says if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them you must always say ' nothing ' and if they insist say ' whatever this was the nature of being at that table in fact she indicated that and when god smiles there is peace so we had to add god into it and so i came to think that mama eternal mama eternal is always wondering are all the children in and if we had been faithful let me explain where it was a very intimate moment in fact you could come and daddy brought this is when we can just be who we are and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on why would daddy bring and mom overheard us and said well you know what if you really understand the nature of this celebration it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love that 's what the celebration is all about it 's time to make space to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community so we sucked up it was a we 're all strands in it and whatever 's compassion a harvested field of grain with some grain but you must always leave some on the edges just in case there 's someone who has not had the share necessary i see always it stirs my heart a picture of dr martin luther king walking across the bridge and going into selma just a photograph arm in arm for struggle suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of in my community was upset you heard about riots all across the land bobby kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message this is the picture they said it 's going to be too volatile for you to go he insisted i must go so sitting on a flatbed truck the elders of the community are there and bobby stands up and says to the people i have bad news for you some of you may not have heard that dr king has been assassinated i know that you are angry and i know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge but he said what i really want you to know because i had someone dear to me snatched away i know how you feel i allowed my anger my bitterness my grief i think i see it i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world and they each read in their own language a central affirmation and that was some version of the golden rule as you would that others would do unto you do also unto them twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself last night at chagrin fall a it was he said one of the most powerful moments but you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come and you invited them ' find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated when we have been despised and rejected ' and they all spoke out of their own traditions a word about the healing power of a sense of compassion but i got to do i have to tangibilitate the gospel so the real issue is how do you tangibilitate how do you make it real my faith has constantly lifted up the ideal and challenged me when i fell beneath it in my tradition there is a gift that we have made to other traditions to everybody around the world who knows the story the good samaritan many people think of it primarily in terms of charity but for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable was what is the greatest commandment and your neighbor as yourself what do you mean and how religious authorities but an unsuspecting despised person came along saw the man in need provided oil and wine for his wounds and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper take care of him but if needs continue make sure that you provide them and whatever else is needed i will provide it and pay for it when i return this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan a good samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and one who provides a system of sustained care i like that ' a system of sustained care ' in the inn take care i think maybe it 's one time when the bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary that all god 's children would have their needs cared for so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks in regards to health are all the children in and we could say yes oh what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate i recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs being concerned for housing for for children even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off where they are going but now to be a good samaritan and i always say and to be a good american for me is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care compassion takes on a corporate dynamic i believe that whatever we did around that table at bloodworth street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that that family together that understands the nature of our unity we are one people together let me explain to you what i mean when i think about we would decide to establish this charter of compassion the reason it 's important because this is a very special time in history it is the time that biblically we would speak of as unusual things are beginning and yet there is so much more that needs to be done we need to bring health and food and education and respect for all god 's citizens all god 's children remembering mama eternal now let me close my comments by telling you and so i want to close with a little song i close with this song it 's a children 's song because we are all and if mama eternal has taught us correctly and this is why we do it the song says i made heaven so happy today"
