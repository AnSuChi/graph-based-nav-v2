  "transcript": "a virtually unknown german mathematician named theodor kaluza suggested a very bold bold and in some ways a very bizarre idea he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of that is in addition to left right back forth and up down kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don 't yet see now when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea sometimes that 's all it is bold and bizarre but it has nothing to do with this particular idea however although we don 't yet know whether it 's right or wrong and at the end i 'll discuss experiments which in the next few years may tell us whether of back story go to one thousand nine hundred and seven this is a year when einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project to try to understand fully there are many people around who thought that that describes the motion of planets the motion of the moon and so forth the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees hitting people on the head all of that could be described using newton 's work but einstein realized that newton had left something out of the story because even newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity he 'd been unable to figure out how it really works how is it that the sun ninety three million miles away [ that ] somehow it affects the motion and that is a task to which einstein set himself to figure out how gravity works and let me show you what is that he found imagine space is a substrate of all there is einstein and that communicates the force of gravity even the earth warps space around it now look at the moon the moon is kept in orbit according to these ideas because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence we go to view of this the earth itself is that is this new idea about how gravity actually works now and that is what like einstein was in search of what we call a unified theory that 's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature 's forces from one set of ideas one set of principles one master equation if you will so kaluza said to himself einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space in fact space and time to be more precise maybe i can play the same game with the other known force which was at that time known as the electromagnetic force we know of others today but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about you know that raised a question warps and curves in what einstein had already warps and curves to describe gravity there didn 't seem to be anything else to warp or curve maybe there are more dimensions of space he said if i want to describe one more force maybe i need one more dimension so he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space now here 's the thing when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions not he found the old equations that einstein had already derived in three dimensions those were for gravity but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension and when he looked at that equation it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force now clearly kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously he in fact there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to now but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded two questions immediately arise from his observation number one if there are more dimensions in space where are they we when you try to apply it to the world around us now the first question was answered in but there might also be tiny a cable supporting a traffic light it 's in manhattan you 're in central park it 's kind of irrelevant but the cable looks but if we zoom in and take the perspective of say a little ant walking around little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions the long dimension but also this clockwise and i hope you appreciate this it took so long to get these ants to do this but there might be additional dimensions curled up sort of like the circular part of that cable so small that they have so far remained invisible let me show you what that would look like so if we take a look say at space itself and way but if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about that 's like the grid part but you could also access the tiny curled up dimension that 's so small that we can 't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself the idea is there could be more as we see there now that 's does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world well it turns out that einstein and kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time in detail it didn 't work in detail for instance they couldn 't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory so many people worked on it but by the ' 40s as you were indicating but when we study superstring theory we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling new form so let me just tell you how that goes superstring theory what is it well it 's a theory that tries to answer the question what are the basic fundamental indivisible uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of so we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents so deep inside we all know you go sufficiently far down you have atoms we also all know that atoms are not the end of the story they have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons any of these particles there is something else this something else is this dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string that 's where the idea string theory comes they don 't produce different musical notes rather they produce the different particles making up the world around us so if these ideas are correct it 's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy vibrating in different the different particles so matter and the forces of nature all now here is the catch when you study the mathematics of string theory you find that it doesn 't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space it doesn 't work in a universe with four dimensions of space nor five nor six finally you can study the equations and show that it works only in a universe that has ten dimensions of space and one dimension of time it leads us right back to this idea of kaluza and klein that our world when appropriately described has more now you might think about that and say well ok you know if you have extra dimensions and they 're really tightly curled up yeah perhaps we won 't see them if they 're small enough but that is one of the other predictions of string theory or in the remaining time i 'd like to tell you two features of them first is many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics theoretical science and that question is this as scientists have done for the last hundred years there appear to be about twenty numbers that really describe our universe these are numbers like the mass the strength of gravity the strength of the electromagnetic force a list of about twenty numbers that have been measured with incredible precision but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do now does string theory offer an answer not yet but we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions and the wonderful thing is if those numbers had any other values than the known ones the universe as we know it wouldn almost any fiddling makes so can we explain those twenty numbers and string theory suggests that those twenty numbers have to do with the extra let me show you how this intertwined geometry this is an example of something known as a calabi yau shape name isn 't all that important extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape interesting structure and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the but they 're so small that we wouldn 't know it so what is the physical implication though relevant to those twenty numbers consider this if you look at the all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate so just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument and if you watch these so if we knew exactly what and if we could calculate the allowed vibrational we should be able to calculate those twenty numbers and if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation now the second issue that i want to finish up with is how might we test or can we actually test for these extra dimensions and we think and this is i think very exciting that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions here 's how it goes every so often those particles will be aimed at each other so there 's a head on collision the hope is that if the collision has enough energy it may eject some of the debris and if there 's less energy this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away and if it drifts away in the right pattern this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there let me show you that idea visually so imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton but here 's how the experiment will go you take these particles you slam them together you slam them together so this is the kind of experiment that 'll be looking at in the next five and to me this is a really remarkable a remarkable opportunity going back to newton with absolute space didn 't provide anything but an arena a stage in which the events of the universe take place einstein comes along and says well space and time can warp and curve that 's what gravity is and now string theory comes along and says yes gravity quantum but only if the universe has more dimensions thank you very much"
