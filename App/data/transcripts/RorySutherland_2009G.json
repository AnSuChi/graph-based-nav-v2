  "transcript": "which is ted 's secret sister that that pays all the bills it 's held every two years in burma and i particularly remember a really good speech by kim jong il on how to get teens smoking again actually if you think about it if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material you basically have two choices you can either live in a world which is poorer which people in general don 't like or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value that actually intangible value in many ways is a very very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things here is one example this is a train which goes from london to paris the question was given to a bunch of engineers about fifteen years ago how do we make the journey to paris better call me mister picky i 'm just an ad man but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey now you 'll still have about three billion pounds left in change and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down medical people scientific people have an obsession with solving the problems of reality when actually most problems once you reach a basic level of wealth in society most problems are actually problems of perception they have no side effects or if they do they 're imaginary so you can safely ignore them so and i actually went to the the marginal revolution blog by tyler cowen i don 't know if anybody knows it someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further and actually produce placebo education which gives you an insane sense welcome to oxford ladies and gentlemen the point of placebo education is interesting how many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception rather than that tedious hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality here 's a great example from history i 've heard this attributed to several it seems to be fredrick the great you get less price volatility the only problem is potatoes if you think about it look pretty disgusting very few vegetables rather like contemporary scottish people so actually so he tried plan b he tried the marketing solution which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable and none but the royal family could consume but with secret instructions not to guard it very well before long there was a massive underground potato growing operation in it was an absolute masterpiece i told this story and a gentleman from turkey came up to me and said very very good marketer fredrick the great but not a patch on ataturk ataturk was a lateral thinker he made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil i can 't verify that fully but it does not matter there is your environmental problem solved by the way guys all convicted child molesters have to drive a porsche cayenne it 's not the dollar it 's actually the peso in buenos aires very clever buenos aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists as an advertising man i have to admire that but the first thing all value is subjective second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion these funny signs that flash your speed at you some of the new ones on the bottom right now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face but they prevent twice as many accidents so the bizarre thing which is baffling to conventional classically trained economists is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a sixty fine and three penalty points in britain we tend to feel whoa got another three not another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace which remember is what after all the environmental movement needs to be about this again is from prussia from i think about one thousand eight hundred and twelve one thousand eight hundred and thirteen the wealthy prussians to help in the war against the french badge value it said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past so the modern equivalent would of course be this but actually there is a thing just as there are veblen goods where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous classless and minimalistic if you think about it shakerism was a proto environmental movement adam smith talks about 18th century america where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great it was almost a block in the economy in new england because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors it 's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to they are often quite egalitarian in terms of dress denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value coca cola but it 's worth remembering andy warhol 's point about coke what warhol said about coke is he said what i really like about coca cola is the president of the united states can 't get a better coke than the bum on the corner of the street now that is we basically have to change our views slightly there is a basic view that real value involves making things involves labor it involves engineering it patently and it 's much fairer when this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food you had a monopoly supplier on the left you have rupert murdoch or the bbc and on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it laughter nowadays the user is actually involved this is actually what 's called in the digital world user generated content although it 's called agriculture in the world of food this is actually called a mash up where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it in the world of food we call it cooking this is food two point zero which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people the pie the sandwich we invented the whole lot of them we 're not very good at food in general the earl of sandwich didn 't invent the sandwich he actually invented the toasty but then the earl of toasty would be a ridiculous name finally we have contextual communication now the reason i show you pernod it 's only one example every country has a contextual alcoholic drink but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else unicum in hungary for example the greeks have actually managed to produce something called retsina which even tastes shite when you 're in greece but so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people for giving them better information b j fogg at the university of stanford makes the point that actually the mobile phone is is he 's invented the phrase persuasive technologies he believes the mobile phone by timely and immediate is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented now if we have all these tools at our disposal we simply have to ask the question and thaler and sunstein have of how we can use these more intelligently i the reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior if you did this more people would save more it 's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions and the very nature of the decisions changes obviously i don 't want people to do this because as an advertising man i tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed i 've got an example here from canada there was a young intern at ogilvy canada called hunter somerville who was working in improv in toronto and got a part time job in advertising and was given the job of advertising shreddies now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible without changing the product in the slightest shreddies is a strange square whole grain cereal only available in new zealand canada and britain it 's kraft 's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown in working out how you could re launch shreddies he came up with this most perfect example of intangible value creation all it requires is photons neurons and a great idea i would say it 's a work of genius but naturally you can 't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research man so shreddies is actually producing a a six or a nine i 've heard which was the combo pack bear in mind there is an organization called the american institute of wine economics which actually does extensive research into perception of things and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine except when you tell the people how expensive it is in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more so drink your wine blind in the future we need to spend more time appreciating what and less time agonizing over what else we can do two quotations to more or less end with one of them and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing there is some evidence by the way that things like social networking help do that because they help people share news they give badge value to everyday little trivial activities so they actually reduce which is magic replaces material value"
