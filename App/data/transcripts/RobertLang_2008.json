  "transcript": "so let me start what is origami most people think they know what origami is it 's this flapping birds toys cootie catchers that sort of thing and that is what origami used to be the common theme what makes it origami is folding is how we create the form you know it 's very old this is a plate from one thousand seven hundred and ninety seven it shows these women playing with these toys if you look close and you would think something that 's been around that long so restrictive folding only and he created tens of thousands of new designs but even more importantly he created a language a way we could communicate a code of dots dashes and arrows harkening back to susan blackmore 's talk we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection and we know where that leads and where it has led in origami is to things like this this is an origami figure one sheet no cuts folding only hundreds of folds this cloven hooves which is to the art to discover the underlying laws and that leads to a very powerful tool the secret to productivity in so many fields and in origami is letting dead people do your work for you because what you can do is and i want to tell you how we did that in origami and you can 't just draw them arbitrarily they have to obey four simple laws and they 're very simple easy to understand the first law is two colorability you can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting vertex the number of mountain folds the number of valley folds always differs by two two more or two less nothing else if and if you look at how the layers stack you 'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets a sheet can never penetrate a so that 's four simple laws that 's all you need in origami all of origami comes from that and you 'd think can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity but indeed the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin and yet they govern all of chemistry all of life all of history if we obey these laws so in origami to obey these laws we can take simple patterns like this repeating pattern of folds called textures and by itself it 's nothing but if we follow but when we put it together we get something a little different or you can ramp up and go up to fifty stars on a flag and this guy 's on display downstairs so take a look if you get a chance the most powerful tools in origami have related and you get an origami figure laughter what matters is what we mean by those symbols and you might say can you really be that specific i mean a stag beetle it 's got two points for jaws it 's got antennae can you be that specific in the detail you really can and from that stick figure i somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part the last step is not and fold something but we 're going to start small this base has a lot of flaps in it we 're going to learn how to make one flap how would you make a single flap fold it in half fold it in half fold it again until it gets long and narrow and then we 'll say at the end of that that 's a flap i could use that for a leg an arm anything like that what paper went into that flap well if i unfold it and go back to the crease pattern you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap so that 's the flap and all the rest of the paper 's left over i can use it for something else well there there are other dimensions for flaps if i make the flaps skinnier i can use a bit less paper if i make the flap as skinny as possible i get so now we 're ready to scale up what if i want to make something that has a lot of flaps what do i need i need a lot of circles and in the and i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes so we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules that gives you the folds those folds fold into a base you shape it 's so simple that a computer could do it and you say and you can download it from my website it 's free it runs on all the major platforms even windows and it calculates the crease pattern it does the circle and if you use that stick figure that i just showed which you can kind of tell it 's a deer it 's got antlers and if you take this crease pattern you fold on the dotted lines you 'll get a base that you can then shape or you could do a moose any other kind of deer these techniques revolutionized this art we found we could do insects spiders which are close things with legs things with legs and wings and if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn 't interesting enough then you could do two praying mantises she 's eating him i call it snack time because everyone 's doing it you can make multiple subjects so these are a couple of instrumentalists player but the guitar bass that 's not so hot do a little more complicated instrument well then you could do an organ and what this has allowed is the creation of i want exactly this and this and this everything you 'll see here except the car is origami really was but these were all real folded objects that that we made surprisingly origami and the structures that we 've developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine in science in space in the body consumer electronics and more and i want to show you some of these examples by koryo miura a japanese engineer he studied a folding pattern and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure and he used it to design this solar array it 's an artist 's rendition but it flew in a japanese telescope in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five it unfolds in two places it folds in thirds it 's a very simple pattern you wouldn 't even call that origami they certainly didn 't need to talk to origami a lens the size of a football field there were two groups of people who were interested in this planetary scientists who want to look up and then other people who wanted to look down whether you look up or look down how do you get it up in space you 've got to get it up there in a rocket and rockets are small so you have to make it smaller how about the only way is to fold it up somehow so you have to do something like this this was a but this pattern 's not going to work to get something one hundred meters down to a few meters so the livermore engineers wanting to make use of the work of dead people or perhaps live origamists said let 's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing so they and we developed a pattern together and they adopted that for their first generation which was not one hundred meters it was a has about a quarter mile focal length and it works perfectly on its test range and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle and you can see here that the sail expands out and you can still see the fold lines but needs to be small and this example is the latter this is a heart stent developed by zhong you at oxford university it holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination but it needs to be much smaller for the trip your blood vessels and this stent folds down using an origami pattern based on a model called the water bomb base and they want to do their design by simulation so they need to figure out how in a computer to flatten an airbag and the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation and so they can do and that leads to a really the heart stent came from that little blow up box that you might have learned in elementary school called the water bomb base the the thing is that this often happens in math and science when you and as weird and surprising as it may sound origami may someday even save a life"
