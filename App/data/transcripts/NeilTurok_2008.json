  "transcript": "an incredible surprise to me i develop and test models of the big bang and i 've been moonlighting for the last five years helping with a project in africa people wonder you know how do you have time to do this and so on and so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated so i thought i 'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life well i was born in south africa when they were released we left we had an amazing childhood we didn 't have any but we were outdoors most of the time we had fantastic friends serengeti and but i came back to africa at the age of seventeen as a volunteer teacher eighty percent of the men in lesotho worked in the mines over the border in brutal conditions i was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth but the kids were the best part the kids were amazing extremely eager i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible to but i took them outside one day and i said i want you to estimate the height of the building and i expected them to put a ruler next to the wall size it up with a finger and make an estimate of the height but there was one little boy very small for his age he was the son of one of the poorest families in the and so i said i was annoyed i said i counted the number of bricks and now i 'm multiplying well i hadn 't thought of that one and many experiences like this happened he was home on his three month leave from the mines sitting next to him one day he said there 's only one thing that i really loved at school and you know what it was shakespeare and he recited some to me these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in africa it 's by them not by us i 'm not going to explain this equation but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject we can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line and it contains eighteen free parameters but it 's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level and apart which you 've heard about here like dark energy and dark matter this equation describes seems to describe everything about the universe and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in tanzania who 's a wonderful scottish lady and she 's now in her 80s and when i try to explain my work to her she waved away all the details and she said neil there 's only one question that really matters 's a question we 've all been avoiding the standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence full of a strange kind of energy but the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely well this possibility is actually suggested by the which try to explain all those eighteen free parameters in in a single framework which will hopefully predict all of them according to these theories there are extra dimensions of space not just the three we 're familiar with but at every point in the room there are more dimensions and in particular there 's one rather strange one in the most elegant unified theories we have the strange one looks likes this that we live and i can only show it as a sheet but it 's really and a tiny distance away there 's another sheet but it 's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus i won 't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this but it comes out of the math but it 's slightly different than in the conventional picture conventional picture of the big bang is a point everything comes out of a point you have infinite density no hope of describing that and we have a chance of a consistent we 've explored this alternative we 've shown that it can fit all of the data the fluctuations in the microwave background and in this scenario not only was the big bang not the beginning both in space and in time and there 've been and well making and testing models of the universe is for me the best way i have of enjoying and appreciating the universe and we try to convince ourselves we really try to convince ourselves they 're wrong that 's progress when we as i pursued my career something what about those kids i 'd left behind instead of developing as we 'd all hoped in the ' 60s things had gotten worse africa was gripped by poverty disease and war this is very and so the idea is to represent each country so here 's just the standard area map of the world by the way africa is very large and the next map now shows africa around the time of independence for many african states now this is and then two thousand and two and here 's a projection for two thousand and fifteen what about africa 's population the population isn 't out of proportion to its area but africa leads the world in deaths malnutrition simple infections and then there are deaths from war ok currently there are forty five thousand people a month dying in the congo as a consequence of the war there over coltan and diamonds and other things it 's still going on what about africa 's capacity to do something about these problems and here most shocking to me the number of scientific research papers coming out of africa it just doesn 't exist that all of the aid that 's been given has completely failed to put africa onto its own two feet well my parents were both elected alongside nelson and winnie mandela they were the only other couple and in two thousand and one i took a research leave to visit them and while i was busy working i was working on these colliding worlds in the day but i learned that there was a desperate shortage of the ability to make and test models and if so i or aims bring them together with lecturers from all over the world and we 'll try to give them a fantastic education well as a cambridge professor i had many contacts and to my astonishment they backed me one hundred percent they said go and do it and we 'll come and lecture and i knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries where they don 't have any opportunities together with the best lecturers in the world who i knew would come because of the interest in africa so we bought a it 's an 80 room art deco hotel from the so we got an 80 room hotel we decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word we 're going to start the best math institute in africa in this hotel well the new south africa is a very highly motivated staff there are internet cafes and bright young africans are desperate to join the global community to be successful and so when word came out that aims was opening it spread very quickly via we designed learning environment and it was fantastic to start a university from you have to rethink what is the university for no droning on at the chalkboard we emphasize working in groups every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades lives together in this hotel lecturers and students and it 's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at one a m the students don 't usually leave the computer lab till two or three a m and then they 're up again at eight in the morning lectures problem solving and so on it 's an extraordinary place they 'll have successful careers and here is a list of last year 's graduates graduated in june and what they 're currently doing where they are is indicated over here and where they 've gone so these are all postgraduate students and they 've all gone on to master 's and ph d degrees in excellent places five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the u s or europe is a continual source pride and commitment to africa we 've accepted an application and green a and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green so there 's two thousand and five minus six minus seven minus eight we 're well on we had some of the students filmed at home before they came to aims and i 'll just show you one so tendai came to aims and did very well and i 'll let her take it from there tm my name is tendai mugwagwa and i was a student at aims after that i came to the netherlands where i 'm now doing a ph d in theoretical immunology professor tendai is working very independently so i 'm happy she 's and he 's shown here with his favorite and and he came to cambridge so now i 'm going to get to my we have good parties in africa and last month they threw a surprise party for me here 's somebody you 've seen already point out a few other exceptional people in this picture so we were having a party as you can see they 're completely eclipsing me at this point this is ezra she 's from darfur and somehow stays smiling in and she 's now at aims and our wish has two parts one is a dream and the other 's a plan ok our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african the encouragement and the courage among them will be not only brilliant scientists i 'm sure of that from what we 've seen at aims they 'll also be the brins and pages of the future well i said we also have a plan and our plan is quite simple aims is now a proven model and what we need to do is to replicate it each will have a in a different area of science we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural cultural barriers as it does at aims and we want to add elements to the curriculum we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills and its graduates will form a powerful network working together for peace and progress across the continent over the last looking at potential sites for new aims centers and here are the ones we 've selected and each of these centers has a strong local team which international lecturers will be happy to and last it won 't be easy at every site there will be huge challenges local scientists must play leading roles and governments must be persuaded to buy in conditions are very difficult but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made aims work"
