  "transcript": "i 'm going to discuss with you we in the prior film some of the old things that we did like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic and i 'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people before that patient arrives at an emergency and people with silent ischemia which translated into english means they don 't have any symptoms it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital the ami acute myocardial infarction which is a doctor 's big word so they can charge you more money have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on thus nine hundred thousand people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle particularly us men because we are very brave we are very brave and we don 't want to admit that i 'm having a hell of a chest pain then approximately twenty five percent of all patients never have any symptoms what are we going to do about them how can we save their lives it 's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women a means to determine if there 's a complete blockage of a coronary artery that ladies and gentlemen is a heart attack means consist of noting something a little technical that means that if there 's an electrical signal in the heart and one part of the ecg which we call the st segment elevates to save their life well the doctor can program a level of this st elevation voltage and when it goes beep so we have to try these devices out because the fda won 't just let us use them on and what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin like you see in an emergency room that was the signal and after three minutes well if you really studied it you 'd see a difference but what happened when we looked inside the pig 's heart to the electrogram there was the baseline first of all a much bigger and more reliable signal second of all i 'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference and we see here an st segment elevation right after this sharp line look at the difference there it doesn 't take much and computers can be programmed to easily detect it we can use it to tell people that they 're having a heart attack then we tried it which is what a heart attack is and it 's not hard to see that then this rise that 's the and then he did it again we filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see even after ten seconds a great rise in this and computers don 't go to sleep we have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement what does the system look like well on the left is the imd which is implantable medical device and tonight in the tent you can see it they 've exhibited it it 's about this big the size of a pacemaker it 's implanted with very conventional techniques and the exd is an external device that you can have on your night table it 'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because if you don 't you 're in deep doo doo and then finally a programmer that will set the level which is the level which says you are having a heart attack ok test this final device after it 's built so we said well we 're experts in stents tonight you 'll see some of our invented stents we said so we 'll put in a stent but we 're not going to put in a stent that we 'd put in people we 're putting in a copper stent and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks that 's not very nice but after all we had to find out what the answer is so we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig and let me show you the result that 's very gratifying as far as people who have heart disease are concerned so there it was thursday morning we stopped the pig 's medication and there is his electrogram the signal from inside the pig 's heart coming out by radio telemetry then on friday at six forty three he began to get but look what happened at ten six st elevation can you see it there six was having a heart attack and that 's what happened minutes later then ventricular fibrillation the heart quivers instead of beats this is just before death of the pig and then the pig died it went flat line but we had a little bit over an hour where we could 've saved this pig 's we can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack feel some chest pain or indigestion it 's not all that bad you decide not to do anything you wait as burns and other critical patients are treated because seventy five percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains don 't have ami so you 're not taken very seriously they finally see you it takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it and it 's hard to do because they don 't have the baseline data which the computer we put in you gets and that is the typical treatment in the advanced world not africa that 's the typical treatment in the advanced world today we developed the angelmed guardian system and we have a device inside this patient called the implanted angelmed guardian and when you have a blockage the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device which gets your baseline electrogram from twenty four hours ago and the one that caused the alarm so you can take it to the emergency room and show them and say take care of me right away then it goes to a diagnostic we 've called the ambulance the ambulance is on the way it 'll pick you up and we 're going to send the signal to the hospital and we 're going to have it analyzed there and there you 're going to be with your doctor and you 'll be taken care of so you won 't die of a heart attack that 's the first invention that i wanted to describe and now i want to talk about something entirely different at first i didn 't think migraine but then i spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life and lives are being totally ruined by it we have a mission statement for our company doing migraine which is prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches by the application of a safe controlled magnetic pulse applied as needed by the patient now you 're probably very few physicists here if you 're a physicist you 'd know there 's a certain faraday 's law which says if i apply a magnetic magnetic pulse on salt water that 's your brains by the way it 'll generate electric currents and the electric current in the brain so here 's a picture of what we 're doing the patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons that 's shown in red that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the and when it hits the mid brain that 's when the headache begins there 's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura and this visual aura by the way and i 'll show you a picture but it sort of and what we tried was this here is a device called the cadwell model mes10 weighs about seventy pounds has a wire about an inch in diameter and here 's one of the patients who has an aura bad one after the aura what do we do this is what an aura looks like it 's sort of funny dancing lights shown there on the left and right and that 's a fully developed visual aura as we see on top in the middle that means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that 's interfering with the erroneous electrical now i 'm going to all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse what is the result we designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this that you could have a lady in her pocket book and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works well the next thing they have to show is what was on abc news channel seven last week in new york city in the eleven o 'clock news anchor for anyone who suffers from migraine headaches and there are thirty million americans who do tonight a possible answer eyewitness news reporter stacy sager tonight with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away christina sidebottom well my first reaction was that it was looked awfully gun like and it was very strange almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine but researchers here in ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper say it is scientifically sound the zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that yousef mohammed in other words we 're treating electricity with electricity rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we christina now swears by it wonderful thing for my migraine ss researchers are hoping to present their studies to the fda this summer robert fischell and that is the invention to treat migraines you see and this is the first device that we did and i 'm going to talk about my second wish which has something and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches not only those with aura get treated and get diminished and auras can be erased erased and the migraine then and that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on the third and last invention began with an idea epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation now why do we use add on us technical people unlike mr bono have to get into all these technical words well responsive electrical stimulation means that we sense at a place in your brain which is called an epileptic focus which is where and then we respond by we thought we could adapt it for the brain the device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden as well as other diseases of the brain because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it that causes many if not all of brain we formed a company called neuropace and this is a picture of what the device looked like that 's placed into the cranial bone this is probably a better picture here we have our device in which we put in a frame the neurosurgeon has a template he marks it around and uses a dental burr to remove then we snap in the device and we run with wires the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes to the epileptic where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent we can attack that as well provide stimulation only when needed can be turned off if seizures disappear we 've seen no side effects in the forty or so patients in whom it 's been implanted and this shows what an electroencephalogram is and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients then we stimulated and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the not get the epileptic seizure that concludes my discussion of epilepsy which is the third invention that i want to discuss here this afternoon which is mostly like mr bono talked about the first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator called rns for responsive neurostimulator that 's a brilliant acronym for the treatment of other brain disorders well if we 're going to do it for epilepsy why the hell not try it for something else then you saw what that device looked like that the woman was using to fix her migraines i tell you this that 's something which some research engineer like me would concoct not a real designer of good equipment laughter we want to have some people who really know how to do this perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches and some of the sponsors of this ted meeting are such organizations where we have problems that africa doesn 't have and by reducing malpractice litigation malpractice litigation is not an african problem it 's an american problem so to get quickly to my first wish the brain operates by electrical signals if the electrical signals create a brain disorder we can counteract that a signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for like we 're doing with epilepsy even if there is no signal and consider treating psychotic disorders and i want this involved with the ted group such as obsessive compulsive disorder that presently is not well treated with drugs and includes five and his group at neuropace and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving ocd in america and in the world that is the first wish the second wish is at the present time the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators that 's what tms means device to treat migraine headaches appears to be quite successful well that 's the good news the present portable device is far from optimally designed both as to human factors as appearance i think she said it looks like a gun a lot of people don 't like guns laughter engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable tms device that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches and that is the second wish 100 000 dollar prize money that ted was so generous to give me i am donating fifty thousand dollars to the neuropace people another fifty thousand available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines and that 's how i 'll use my prize money somewhat unfortunately it 's much more complicated because it involves lawyers well medical malpractice litigation in the us has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance so that competent physicians are leaving their practice lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury because this patient really ended up badly the high cost of health care in the us is partly due to litigation and insurance costs i 've seen pictures i have a couple of ideas to begin with as a starting point for discussion with the ted group a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign for example i asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent would you believe twelve pages single space the patient has to read before they 're in our trial to cure their epilepsy what do you think someone has at the end of reading twelve single spaced pages they don 't understand what the hell it 's about that 's the present system how about making a video we have entertainment people here we have people who know how to do videos with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient where they see the video and they 're being videoed then let 's go to a simpler explanation then there 's a simpler one and that is one of the ideas now also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done including all the possible failure modes you cannot if a video is there that everything was explained to you and you have it all in the video file it 'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency because it won 't be nearly as good a case of going to court that would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the united states and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone"
