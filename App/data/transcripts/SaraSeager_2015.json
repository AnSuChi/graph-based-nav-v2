  "transcript": "but it 's the search for planets orbiting stars far away and if our sun has planets mercury venus and in the future planets that might be like earth we 're able to help address some of the most amazing and mysterious questions why are we here how and why did life originate and populate our planet the second question that we often think about is are we alone who is out there but i 'm here to tell you just how close we 're getting it 's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us i think of the fact that our sun is but one of many stars this is a photograph of a real galaxy we think but our [ sun ] is one of hundreds of billions of stars and there are just so many stars and so many planets out there that surely there must be life somewhere out there well the biologists get furious with me for saying that because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond earth yet if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside this is really just the tip of the iceberg now if we can imagine going to the west coast of north america and looking out at the night sky and you can see the constellations overlaid and this is where the kepler space telescope focused let 's zoom in this star is called we don 't know too much about we know their size and their orbit and things like that but there 's a very special planet here called this planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star so that the temperature may be here the artist 's conception is just zooming in and showing you what that planet might be like so many people have this romantic notion of astronomers going to the but actually we just work on our computers like everyone else so instead of coming here to tell you about the somewhat tedious nature of the data and data analysis and the complex computer models we here 's a travel poster where the grass is always redder on the other side that 's because orbits a red star and we 're just speculating that perhaps the plants there if there is vegetation that does photosynthesis it has different pigments and looks red enjoy the gravity this planet is more massive than earth and has a higher surface gravity relax on where your shadow always has company laughter we know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars and there 's likely many more out there if we could visit one of those planets you literally would see two sunsets so actually science fiction got some things right tatooine from star wars and i have a couple of other favorite exoplanets to tell you about we think the surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid lava lakes we actually don 't know really anything about this planet but one possibility is that it 's a water world like a scaled up version of one of jupiter 's icy moons that might be fifty percent water by mass and in this case would have a thick steam atmosphere overlaying an ocean but of an exotic form of water a superfluid not quite a gas not quite a liquid and under that wouldn 't be rock but a form of high pressure ice like ice ix we mostly want to find the planets that are goldilocks planets we call them not too big not too small not too hot not too but to do that we 'd have to be able to look at the planet 's atmosphere the star trek enterprise had to travel vast distances at incredible speeds to orbit other planets so although i don 't want to dissuade any budding engineers from figuring out how to do that we actually can and do study planet atmospheres from here from earth orbit this is a picture a photograph of the hubble space telescope and but those are not small planets like earth they 're big hot planets that are easy to but nevertheless i wanted to try to explain to you and you can see all these dark vertical lines some are very narrow and this is actually how astronomers have studied objects in the heavens literally for over a century and i 'll just never forget when i started working on exoplanet atmospheres twenty years ago how many people told me this will never happen we 'll never be able to study them why are you bothering that 's why i 'm pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now and this is really a field other earths in the future when when we can observe them what kind of gases would we be looking for there would be no oxygen virtually so oxygen is here because of life and our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres but which molecules should we search for i actually told you how diverse exoplanets are we expect that to continue in the future when we find other i receive an email email or emails from someone with a crazy theory about physics of gravity or cosmology or some such so please don 't email me one of your crazy theories i had my own crazy theory but who does the mit professor go to well i emailed a nobel laureate in physiology or medicine and he said and that theory was that life produces all small molecules think about it carbon dioxide carbon monoxide molecular hydrogen molecular nitrogen methane methyl chloride so many gases they also exist for other reasons but just life even produces ozone we go to talk to him about this and immediately he shot down the theory he found an example that that didn 't exist so we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field but back to exoplanets the point is that life produces so many different types of gases literally thousands of gases and so what we 're doing now is just trying to figure out which gases could be and so when it comes time when we find gases in exoplanet atmospheres that we won 't know if they 're being produced by intelligent aliens so working on the models and thinking about biochemistry it 's all well and good but a really big challenge ahead of us is how how are we going to find these these planets there are actually many ways to find planets several different ways but the one that i 'm most focused on is how can we open a gateway and actually i just finished leading a two year project in this very special phase the central truss would expand with the petals snapping into place and this whole structure would have to fly tens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope it 's about tens meters in diameter and the goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision and it has to be a very special shape because of the physics of defraction now this is a real project that we worked on literally you would not believe how hard just so you believe it 's not just in movie format here 's a real photograph of and in this case i just wanted you to know that that central truss has heritage left over from large radio deployables in space what are we going to find well in the best case we will find and this is actually a real photograph of earth but what 's so awesome to consider is that if there are intelligent aliens orbiting on a planet around a star near to us and they build complicated space telescopes of the kind that we 're trying to build all see is this pale blue dot a pinprick of light and so sometimes when i pause to think about my i am devoting the rest of my life to finding another earth and i can guarantee that in the next generation of space telescopes in the second generation and the capability to split up the starlight so that we can look for gases and assess the greenhouse but there 's more in this case of searching for we are making a new kind of map of the nearby stars and they will look back at all of us as the generation who first found and i give you for a question rosetta mission manager fred jansen fred jansen you mentioned halfway through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an exoplanet like earth is not there yet when do you expect this will be there and what 's needed and that will be our first shot jc i 'm going to ask you one so i am really struck by the notion in your career of the the opposition you faced that when you began thinking about exoplanets there was extreme skepticism in the scientific community that they existed the thing is that as scientists we 're supposed to be skeptical because our job to make sure that what the other person is saying actually makes sense or not but i think you 've seen it from this session it 's like being an explorer you have this immense curiosity this stubbornness this sort of resolute will that you will go forward no matter what other people say jc i love that thank you sara"
