  "transcript": "when i had a so he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around lots of you so hopefully this will bring back some happy or possibly some slightly disturbing memories something very simple newton 's law the force equals mass times acceleration this is something that perhaps turkish airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign we can get to acceleration equals force over mass which means that for a larger particle it explains why and why companies like unilever and p & g keep brands separate like ariel and pringles and dove the marketing is the bigger a the more difficult it is to reposition it so think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures now who remembers heisenberg 's uncertainty principle so to explain that then the photon of light has momentum which think about the group and yet mcdonald 's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets who stuff their trolleys full of fresh and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly so luckily with now better point of sale tracking more digital media consumption you can measure more what consumers actually do the marketing is the message for marketing is that so next the scientific method an axiom of physics of all science says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation you can only disprove it so if we take an example ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the earth it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that and there are parallels for marketing but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers ' belief take bp but then think about toyota it was for a but it 's easy to disprove it any hypothesis and lastly to the slightly obscure world of entropy the second law of thermodynamics this says that entropy which is a measure of the disorder of a system will always increase things have changed you can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the conservative party did earlier this year with their with the kind of digital it 's impossible to control where it goes your brand starts being dispersed it gets more chaotic it 's out of your control it makes this distribution of energy a so the lesson from physics is that entropy will my teacher mr vutter told me that physics is cool thank you"
