  "transcript": "and even though i was too young to understand what was happening i had a deep sense of the suffering and the fear around me experiences had a major impact on how i now think about war and conflict giving in is not an option for these types conflicts when people 's rights are violated when their countries are occupied when they 're oppressed and humiliated they need a powerful way to resist and to fight back which means that no matter how they will use it instead we must offer them a tool that 's at least as powerful and as effective as violence this is the work i do for the i 've been teaching people in some of the most difficult situations around the world but people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years in most of the rights that we have today in this country as women as minorities as workers as people of different sexual orientations and citizens concerned with the environment these rights weren 't handed to us but because we haven 't learned from this history nonviolent struggle as a technique is widely misunderstood i met recently with a group of ethiopian activists and they told me something that i hear a lot they said they 'd already tried nonviolent action and it hadn 't worked years ago they held a protest the government arrested everyone and that was the end of that the idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests is a real problem because although protests can be a great way to show that people want change on their own they don 't actually create change at least change that is fundamental or even not so nicely nonviolent struggle works by destroying an opponent and then denying them those sources of power and they can challenge government propaganda by creating alternative media there are a variety of methods that can be used to do this my colleague and mentor gene sharp has identified one hundred let me give you a recent example until a few months ago guatemala was ruled by corrupt former military officials with ties to organized crime people were generally aware of this but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it until one group of citizens just twelve regular people put out a call on facebook to their friends to meet in the central plaza holding signs with a message renuncia ya resign already they stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country at one point the organizers delivered hundreds of to various government buildings with a message if you don 't have the huevos the balls to stop corrupt candidates from running for office you can borrow ours president molina responded by vowing that he would never step down and the activists realized that they couldn 't just keep protesting and ask the president to resign they needed to leave him no choice i 've been greatly inspired by the creativity and bravery of people using nonviolent action in nearly every country in the world for example recently a group of activists in uganda released a crate of pigs in the streets you can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them the pigs were painted the color of the ruling party one pig was even wearing a hat hat that people recognized but these isolated actions do very little if they 're not part of a larger strategy yet this is how most of the world 's nonviolent movements nonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare if not more its participants must be well trained meanwhile nonviolent struggle is rarely systematically studied there are still only a few dozen people in the world who are teaching it because we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict are not adequate for the new challenges that we 're facing the us government recently admitted that it 's in a stalemate in its war against but what most people don 't know is that people have stood up to isis using nonviolent action when isis captured mosul in june two thousand and fourteen but on the first day of school not a single child showed up parents simply refused to send them they told journalists they would rather homeschool their children than to have them brainwashed but what if it was coordinated with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance that have taken place against isis what if the parents ' boycott was part of a larger strategy the engineers needed to extract and refine the media infrastructure and communications networks and transportation systems and the local businesses that isis relies on it may be difficult to imagine defeating isis with action that is nonviolent but it 's time we challenge the way we think about conflict and the choices we have in facing it let 's learn more about where nonviolent action has worked and how we can make it more powerful just like we do with other systems and technologies that are constantly being refined to better meet human needs it may be that we can improve nonviolent action to a point where it is increasingly used in place of war violence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned in the same way that bows and arrows were because we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective with human innovation we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful than the newest and latest technologies of war the greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence thank you"
