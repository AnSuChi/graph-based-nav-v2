  "transcript": "and this world i 'm going to talk about is the micro world and that can be seen directly through a microscope so let 's start off looking at something rather so that 's just the eye of the bee as we go smaller here is a human hair a human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see it 's about a tenth of a millimeter and as we go smaller again about ten times smaller than that is a cell so you could fit ten human cells when i first saw living cells in a microscope i was absolutely so if you look at the cell like that from the immune system they 're actually moving all over the place this cell is looking for and it engulfs it and eats it if you take some heart cells they 'll just sit there and beat that 's their job every cell has a mission and these cells the mission is to move blood around our body and that 's what as you go farther down this scale here that 's a micron or a micrometer and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom now an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom that 's how small that is and microscopes that we have today can actually see individual so this whole world the nano world this area in here is called the nano world and the nano world the whole micro world that we see there little tiny bug living in a flower so if you look at this flower here and you 're a little bug if you 're on that surface of that of that flower that 's what the terrain would look like the petal of that flower looks like that so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects and if you look a little bit closer at this and you notice that it 's got these little these are like little jelly like things that are what are called spurs these are it 's not like what we see these are little bits of individual of pollen there and there and here is a what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen when you look in a microscope it 's actually made of thousands so this for example when you see bees flying around these little plants and they 're collecting pollen those pollen grains that they 're collecting they pack and they 're also collecting nectar and that 's what makes the honey that we eat here 's a close up picture or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth and if you had really really good vision with your naked eye you 'd see it about that well there 's the stamen and the pistil but look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope that 's the stamen and there 's the the pistil there and these are the little little things called trichomes and that 's what makes the the flower give a fragrance and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances i want to talk about something really ordinary just ordinary sand i became interested in sand about ten years ago when i first saw sand from maui you have fragments of other shells you have you have bits of a volcano there 's a little bit of a volcano there you have tube worms an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand and the reason that is is because in a place like this island a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or things like coral and so forth so here 's for example a picture of sand from so here we see for example a sponge spicule two bits of coral here that 's a sea urchin spine here 's what most of the sand in our world looks like these are quartz crystals so most sand in the world on on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar it 's the erosion of granite rock so mountains are built up up and they erode away by water and they become grains of sand there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful these are sand from near the great lakes and you can see that it 's filled with minerals it 's different like they 're little jewels there are places in africa where they do the mining of jewels and you go to the sand where where the rivers every single grain is different there are no two grains of sand alike in the world every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere they 're like a snapshot in time and you can see those in micrometeorites this is some micrometeorites that the army and they 're quite amazing looking and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world so nasa wanted me to take some pictures of moon sand so they sent me sand from all the different landings and i started taking pictures with my this was the first picture i took it which is sort of interesting now the way my microscopes work is normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope keep taking pictures and then i have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks this looks very different than any sand on earth that i 've ever seen and i 've seen a lot of sand on earth believe me look at this hole in the middle that hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the moon now the moon has no atmosphere so micrometeorites come in continuously and the whole surface of the moon is covered with powder now and you can see here that that is that 's sort of vaporized and that material like that and you 'd never find that on earth most of the of the sand on on the moon especially and you know when you look at the moon there 's the dark areas and the light areas the dark areas are lava flows they 're and that 's what this sand looks like very similar to the sand that you would see in other sands when these micrometeorites come in they vaporize and they make these fountains these microscopic fountains that go up into the i was going to say up into the air but there is no air goes they have these beautiful colored glass spherules and these are actually microscopic you need a microscope to see these now here 's a grain of sand and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there this grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion and it 's never eroded away like the way we have sand on earth erodes away because of water and so forth all you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the sun has these solar storms"
