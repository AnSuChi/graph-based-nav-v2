  "transcript": "have the feeling but we 're absolutely clueless it seems like we need to have a conversation let 's think about it this way we citizens doing our very very best to interact with institutions that are based on an information technology let 's have a look at some of the characteristics of this system and the many get to vote once every couple of years you either have to have a fair bit of money and influence or you have to devote your entire life to politics you have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe least the language of the system it 's incredibly cryptic it but we are completely left out on how those authorities reach their in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation our barriers of information are completely lowered and we can more than ever before express our desires and our concerns our political system remains the same for the past two hundred years and expects us to be contented silence silence in terms of citizens not simply not wanting to participate there 's this commonplace [ idea ] that i truly truly dislike and it 's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic that we shun commitment but can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend physically a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever and citizens that are increasingly used to representing themselves and then we find noise but they still feel the need they need to take to the streets it seems like slogan that was the basis for the formation of our modern democracies representation can now be updated to no representation without a conversation we want our seat at the table but in order to be part of this conversation we need to know what we want to do next because political action is being able to move from agitation to construction my generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests roll back extremely pernicious legislation authoritarian governments and we should be immensely proud of this but we also must admit that we haven 't been good at using those same networks and technologies to successfully articulate an alternative to what we 're seeing and so the risk that we face is that we can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers like the military but our but it 's not either the ability to bring millions onto the streets so the question i 'd like to raise here and i do believe it 's the most important question we need to answer then what is democracy for the internet era what institutions do we want to build for but i truly believe we can 't afford to ignore this question anymore so i 'd like to share our experience and what we 've learned so far and hopefully contribute two cents to this conversation we started thinking can we get our representatives our elected representatives to represent us marshall mcluhan once said that politics is solving today 's problems with yesterday 's tools so the question that motivated us was can we try and solve some of today 's problems with the tools that we use every single day of our lives our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called open source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives to make it easier for so first of all you can get informed but we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information but from doing something with it so better access to information should lead to a conversation about what we 're going to do next and democracyos allows for that because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences one on top of each other but that our healthy and robust public debate should be once again one of its fundamental values is about persuading it 's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement and finally you can vote how you would like your elected representative to vote and if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue you can always delegate your vote to someone else allowing for a dynamic and emerging social leadership but it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick what we needed to do to was to find actors that were able to grab this distributed knowledge in society and use it so we reached out to traditional political parties and we offered them democracyos we said look here you have a platform that you can use to build like little kids they 're cultural so it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea we ran for elections in october last year with this idea our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on democracyos it was our way of hacking the political system but we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions we were making our decisions together with those who we were affecting directly by those decisions it was a very very bold move for a two month old party in the city of buenos aires and we came it was enough for us to become part of the conversation as an institution is launching for the first time in argentina 's history three pieces of on urban transportation and one on the use of public space of course our elected representatives are not saying yes we 're going to vote according to what citizens decide but they 're willing to try they 're willing to open up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they 'll be willing to listen as well it by destroying it but by rewiring it with the tools that internet affords us now but a real challenge is to find to design to create to empower those connectors that are able to innovate to transform and silence into signal and finally bring our democracies"
