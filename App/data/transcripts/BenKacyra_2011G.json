  "transcript": "i 'd like to start with a short story it 's about a little boy whose father was a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on the outskirts of their camp they would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls but at the same time they excited him and the dad used to use those bulls to tell the to the san francisco bay area many decades later where i started a technology company that brought the world its first 3d laser scanning system let me show you how it works female voice long range laser scanning y and z coordinates the point is then recorded into a 3d visualization program all of this happens in seconds you can see here these systems are extremely fast they collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution a surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard pressed to produce maybe five hundred points in a whole day these babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second so can imagine this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry and right about that magnificent bamiyan buddhas hundred and eighty foot tall in afghanistan this clearly devastated the winged bulls and the fate heritage sites all over the world both my wife and i were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites we called the project cyark which stands for cyber archive to date with the help of a global network of partners we 've completed rapa nui and what you 're seeing here are the cloud of points we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal the results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers we also produce media for dissemination to the public free through the etc what you 're looking at in here in here you see a traditional and here you see it rendered and photo textured with the photography that we take of the site and so this is not a video this is actual two to three millimeter accuracy and of course the data can be used to develop 3d models that are very accurate and very detailed and here you 're looking at a model that 's extracted from the cloud of points for stirling castle it 's used for studies for visualization as well as for education the more it became clear to me that we are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them of course tornadoes etc but actually it was accelerating acid rain not to mention terrorism and wars it was getting more and more apparent that we 're fighting a losing battle we 're losing our sites and basically we 're losing a piece and a significant piece of our collective memory imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from luckily the last two or three decades digital technologies have been developing that have helped us to develop tools that we 've brought to bear in the digital preservation in our digital preservation war this includes for example the 3d it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work and we created a project we call the cyark five hundred challenge and that is to digitally preserve we do have the technology that 's scaleable and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate so we 're comfortable that this task can to me the five hundred is really just the first five hundred we use technology centers whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites and at the same time it gives them we were approached by a partner of ours the royal kasubi tombs the work was done the royal tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson a few days we received a call is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction let me leave you with a final thought our heritage is much more than our collective memory it 's our collective treasure we owe it to our children our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along thank you i 'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so while i 've been speaking you have been scanned the two wizards that i have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the and of course you can fly through the cloud of points you can look at it from on top from the ceiling you can look from different vantage points but i 'm going to ask doug to zoom in on an individual in the crowd just to show the amount of detail that we can create so you have been digitally preserved in about about four minutes i 'd like to thank the wizards here we were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this the i 'd like to also thank personally the efforts of david let 's give them a hand"
