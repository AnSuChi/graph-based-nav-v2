  "transcript": "now when a normal student writes a paper they might spread the work out a little like this so you know you get started maybe a little slowly but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on everything gets done things stay civil but then then actually the paper would come along and then i would kind of do this and that would happen every so i planned things out and i decided i kind of and then at the end i would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase how hard could it but then the funniest thing happened those first few months so we had an awesome new revised plan and then but and i didn 't really write and so we were here and then two months turned into one month which turned into two weeks and one day i woke up with three days until the deadline and so i did the only thing i could i wrote ninety pages over seventy two hours pulling not one but dove in slow motion and they say is this tim urban and i say yeah and they say we need to talk about your thesis and i say ok and they say it 's the best one we 've ever seen i just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought this guy is amazing no no it was very very bad i write the blog wait but why and a couple of years ago i decided to write about procrastination my behavior has always perplexed the and i wanted to explain to the of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators and why we are the way we are now i had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people and to test this i found an mri lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven so here 's the brain of a both brains have a rational decision maker in them but the procrastinator 's brain also has an instant gratification monkey now what does this mean for the procrastinator well it means everything 's fine until this happens so he actually takes the wheel and he says actually let 's read the entire wikipedia page of the nancy kerrigan tonya harding scandal because i just remembered that that happened then then we 're going to go over to the fridge to see if there 's anything new in there since ten minutes ago 're going to go on a youtube spiral that starts with videos of richard feynman talking about magnets and ends much much later with us watching interviews with justin bieber 's mom all of that 's going to take a while so we 're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today sorry does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel he lives entirely in the present moment he has no memory of the past no knowledge of the future and he only cares about two things easy and fun that works fine if you 're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things and propagating into the next generation but if you haven 't noticed now we 're not in tribal times we 're in an advanced civilization and the monkey does not know what that is which is why we have another guy in our brain who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do we can visualize now sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun like when you 're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well earned leisure time and that 's when we have a conflict leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone it 's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening and the question is in this situation with the monkey behind the wheel turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel someone who 's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments someone called the panic monster but he suddenly wakes up he became very relevant in my life pretty recently because the people of ted reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a ted talk now of course i said yes it 's always been a dream of mine to have done a ted talk in the past excitement the rational decision maker seemed to have something else on his mind he was saying are we clear on what we just accepted do we get what 's going to be now happening one day in the future we need to sit down and work on this right now and the monkey said totally agree but let 's just open google earth and zoom in to the bottom of india like two hundred feet above the ground and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for india so that 's what we did that day and i opened up the website and there was my face staring right back at me and guess who woke up and a few seconds later the whole system 's in mayhem the panic monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior like how someone like me could spend two weeks and then miraculously find the unbelievable work work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages but in the end i was amazed by the response literally thousands of emails came in bankers painters engineers and lots and lots of phd students and they were all writing saying the same thing i have this problem too but what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails and i said everything i 've talked about today the examples i 've given they all have deadlines and when there 's deadlines the effects of procrastination are contained so something in the arts something entrepreneurial there 's no deadlines on those things at first because nothing 's happening not until you 've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum get things going there 's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don 't involve any deadlines like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health panic monster that 's a problem because in all of these non deadline situations and it 's this long term kind of procrastination that 's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier it 's not that they 're cramming for some project it 's that long term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator at times in their own lives so i read these emails and i had a little bit of an epiphany that i don 't think exist that 's right i think all of you are procrastinators now you might not all be a mess like some of us but remember the monkey 's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren 't there that 's one box for every week of a 90 year life that 's not especially since we 've already used a bunch of those so i think we need to all take a long hard look at that calendar we need to think about what we 're really procrastinating on because everyone is procrastinating on something in life we need to stay aware of the instant gratification monkey that 's a job for all of us and because there 's not that many boxes on there it 's a job that should probably start today"
