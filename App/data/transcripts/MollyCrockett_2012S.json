  "transcript": "i do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make i 'm here to tell you the secret to successful sandwich that 's right according to scientists a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions how do i know i 'm the scientist who did the study a few years ago my colleagues and i were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people 's decisions in social situations specifically we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react so we did an experiment we manipulated people 's serotonin levels by giving them this really artificial lemon flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain this is the amino acid tryptophan so what we found was when tryptophan was low people were more likely to take revenge when they 're treated unfairly that 's the study we did and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards thing myself when these came out because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate we gave people this horrible tasting drink and of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you so there you have it the evolution of a headline so the media oversimplified a few things but in the end and it affects not just the stories you read in the news what happened was the marketers came calling would i be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood boosting bottled water or would i go on television to demonstrate in front of a live audience that comfort foods really do make you feel better i think these folks meant well but had i taken them up on offers i would have been going beyond the science and good scientists are careful not to do this but nevertheless neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing here 's one example neuro drinks which according to its label helps reduce stress enhances and promotes a positive outlook i have to say this sounds awesome laughter i could totally have used this ten minutes ago so when this came up in my local shop naturally i was curious about some of the research backing these claims so i went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials and it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties a couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article for half the people the article included a brain and for the other half it was the same article but it didn 't have a brain image so the take home message here is do you want to sell it put a brain on it and we 're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain like just a couple of weeks ago neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain really cool stuff but the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations so what i 'm going to do is show you how to spot dead giveaways really for what 's variously been called 's thoughts and emotions here 's a study literally it quickly became the most emailed article on the site so how 'd they figure this out they put sixteen people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iphones and that 's that the insula does a lot sure the point here is when you see activation in the insula you can 't just pick and choose my colleagues tal yarkoni and russ poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published so chances are really really good that your insula is going off right now but i won 't kid myself to think this means you love me so speaking of love and the brain known to some as dr love who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together the source of love and prosperity this time it 's not a cheese sandwich it 's a hormone called oxytocin you 've probably heard of it so dr love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people 's oxytocin this increases their trust but they 're not the other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy it increases gloating oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group i could say oxytocin is an immoral all over the headlines we see it in supermarkets on book covers what about the clinic brain scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain for the bargain price of a few thousand dollars there are clinics in the u s that will give you one of these spect scans overcome marital conflicts and treat of course a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to this sounds great a lot of people agree some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business there 's just one problem many of them children i am more excited than most people as a neuroscientist about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better count me in but we 're not there yet we haven 't found a buy button inside the brain we can 't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans maybe someday we will but until then we have to be ask to see the evidence ask for the part of the story that 's not being told but that 's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway"
