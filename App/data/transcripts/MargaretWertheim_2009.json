  "transcript": "and it 's a project indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project in many of also a project which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in february two thousand and nine which as one of our previous speakers told us is the 200th anniversary of the birth of charles darwin all of this i 'm going to get to in the next eighteen minutes i hope but let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like and the tallest models are about two or three feet high this is some more images the work involves hundreds of different crochet models involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor ninety nine percent of it done by women on the right hand side that bit there is part of an installation that is about twelve feet there was a lot of talk about global warming and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs and if the bleaching doesn 't go away if the temperatures don 't go down we have a new organization together called the institute for figuring which is little organization we started to promote to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics and i went and put a little announcement up on our site asking for people to join us in this enterprise and they said they were having an exhibition about artists ' response to global i laughed and said well we 've only just started it you can have a little bit of it and then some people in chicago came along and they said in late two thousand and seven the theme of the chicago humanities festival is global warming and we 've got this three thousand square foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef and i naively by this and i write articles eight months later we did fill the chicago cultural center 's three thousand square foot gallery by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own which got completely beyond us the people in chicago decided that as well as and the people in chicago made a reef of their own and it was exhibited alongside ours there were hundreds of people involved in that and in so the whole thing has sort i cast it in bronze but it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure the frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals and kelps and sponges and nudibranchs is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic so what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs the next few minutes is we 're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug this sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century but not until one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven a mathematician at cornell daina taimina made the discovery but you get too many stitches on the needle so she quickly realized crochet was the better thing and indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible and spherical and they have different properties mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist you all have a sense of what a flat space is euclidean space is but mathematicians formalize this in a particular so here we have a line and a point outside the line and euclid said how can i define parallel lines i ask the question how many lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line and you all know the answer does someone want to shout it out but there is another possibility that you all know of spherical and i have a point outside the line how many straight lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line they 've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness it 's called a geodesic and on the surface of a sphere so it 's like the equator or the lines of so we ask the question again how many straight lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line does someone want to guess zero very good now it 's a bit suspicious isn 't it there is two answers to the question so far zero and one and the first two are zero infinity you all got it right exactly there is there 's a third alternative this is what it looks like there 's a straight line and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line this is the drawing this nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because like you they 're sitting there but that 's only because i 'm projecting it onto a flat surface mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this how could they see this what did it mean and the lines come together at the north and south pole but you don 't know what a sphere looks like and someone that comes along and says look here 's a ball and you go ah i can play with it and that 's exactly what happened when daina taimina in one thousand nine here is this diagram in but look i can prove to you that they 're straight so here in wool through a domestic feminine art is the proof that the most famous postulate in and this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe so there is this direct line between feminine handicraft euclid and general relativity they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years i once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age but it also goes deeper than that it also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was what they thought it could and couldn 't do what they thought it could and couldn 't represent it turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders and so too we 've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures we started out chrissy and i and our contributors doing the simple mathematically perfect models but we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it the simple algorithm crochet three increase one when we deviated from that and made embellishments do their own embellishments as it were we have this crochet taxonomic tree of life just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending little embellishments and complexifications in the dna code lead to new things like giraffes or orchids so too do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life and their individual visions but why what 's at stake here what does it matter we live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation algebraic representations equations but through this sort of modality crochet other plastic forms of play people can be engaged with the most abstract high powered theoretical ideas the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher but you can do it through playing with material objects one of the ways that we 've come to think about this is that what we 're trying to do with the institute for figuring and projects like this we 're trying to have kindergarten for grown ups he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation the value of education is something that froebel championed through plastic modes of play the institute for figuring can be engaged with"
