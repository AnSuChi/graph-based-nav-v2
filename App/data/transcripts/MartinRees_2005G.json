  "transcript": "the odd one out is an but let 's start off and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before darwin 's simple beginning to set our earth in a cosmic context and let me just run through a few slides this was the impact that happened last week on a comet it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday so that 's another project for nasa that 's mars from the european mars express saturn 's giant moon this is pictures taken on the way down that looks like a coastline it is indeed but the ocean is liquid methane the temperature minus one hundred and seventy degrees centigrade if we go beyond our solar system twinkly points of light each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it we see stars dying in six billion years the sun will look like that and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion leaving remnants like that on a still bigger we see entire galaxies of stars we see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled and to the cosmologist these galaxies are just the atoms as it were of the large scale universe this picture shows a patch of sky through a small telescope this would look quite blank each is a galaxy fully like ours or andromeda which looks so small and faint because its light has taken ten billion light years to get to us the stars in those galaxies probably don 't have planets around them there 's scant chance of life there that 's because there 's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron the building blocks of planets and of life we believe that all of this emerged from a big bang a hot dense state so how did that amorphous big bang turn into our complex cosmos i 'm going to show you a movie simulation sixteen powers of ten faster than real time which shows a patch but you see dense irregularities and structures develop and we 'll end up after thirteen billion years with something looking rather like our and we compare simulated universes like that i 'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk with what we we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the big bang but we still don 't know what banged and why it banged that 's a challenge for 21st century science if my research group had a logo it would be this picture here an ouroboros where you see the micro world on the left the world of the quantum and on the right the large scale universe of planets stars and galaxies we know our universes are united though links between left and right the everyday world is determined by atoms how they stick together to make molecules stars are fueled by how the but we 'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top the micro world of the quantum is understood but the unfinished business for science is to link together cosmos and micro world with a unified theory symbolized as it were gastronomically at the top of that picture and until we have that synthesis we won 't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom quantum effects could shake everything and so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small which we don 't yet have one idea incidentally and i had this hazard sign to say i 'm going to speculate from now on is that our big bang was not the only one one idea is that our three dimensional universe may be embedded in a high dimensional space just as you can imagine on these sheets of you can imagine ants on one of them thinking it 's a two dimensional universe not being aware of another population of ants on the other and so and here 's another picture bottom right depicts our universe is not beyond that but even that is just one bubble as it were in some vaster reality many people suspect that just as we 've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems one galaxy to many galaxies we have to go to let 's go back to this picture but there 's another challenge to science but we want to understand the very complex and the most complex things are ourselves midway between atoms and stars we depend on stars to make the atoms we 're made of we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure clearly have to be large compared to atoms it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is fifty kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here the science and it 's this science which is not only more than that it 's engendering new kinds of change and i now move on to the second part of my talk and if i was not and i would add that it 's available in paperback and in america it was called our targeted drugs genetic modification artificial intelligence it 's new in our history and the human impact on the global environment greenhouse warming mass extinctions and so forth is unprecedented too and so this makes this coming century a challenge but they will have a dark side in our interconnected world novel technology could empower just one fanatic or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses to trigger some kind on disaster indeed catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure error rather than terror and even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be bill joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over etc i don 't go along with all that but it 's interesting that he had a simple solution it was what he called he wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits now that 's absurdly naive for two reasons first any scientific discovery and also when a scientist makes a discovery he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be and so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of and i think we have to go back to what happened in the post war era post world war ii when the nuclear scientists who 'd been involved in making the atomic bomb in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers and they were inspired not by the young einstein who did the great work in relativity but by the old einstein the icon of poster and t shirt who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws he was premature but he was a moral compass an inspiration to scientists who were equally untidy office there as you can see and he and i think we need not not just campaigning and i think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service or company employees subject to commercial pressure i wrote my book our final century as a scientist just a general scientist but there 's one respect i think in which being a cosmologist offered a the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture but most people even those who are familiar with evolution but it 'll be another six billion years and it 'll be another six billion before that happens and any remaining life on earth is but any life and intelligence that exists then the unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go here on earth and probably far beyond so we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity say from january when it was made to december the 21st century would be a quarter of a second in june but even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective our century is very very the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet when einstein died one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by herblock in the washington post albert einstein lived here we 've been familiar for forty years with this image the fragile beauty of but let 's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar not but for the entire four point five billion year history of our earth over nearly all that immense time earth 's appearance would have changed very gradually the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic but in just a tiny sliver of the earth 's history the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before this signaled the start of agriculture change has accelerated as human populations rose within just fifty years that 's one hundredth of one millionth of the earth 's age the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the planet became an intense emitter of radio waves the total output from all tv and something else happened metallic objects albeit very small ones a few tons at most escaped into orbit around the earth some journeyed to the moons and planets a race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar but could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the earth 's life these human induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed if they continued their vigil what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years will some spasm foreclose or will the biosphere stabilize the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization but for civilization to survive we 'll need the wisdom of the old einstein humane global and farseeing and whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into thank you very much"
