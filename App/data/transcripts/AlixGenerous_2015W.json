  "transcript": "and it 's cooler than in the movies laughter beyond flying breathing fire and making hot men spontaneously appear i can do things like read and write music and i did accepted so yeah i am a very visual thinker words are more like instincts nikola tesla for design test and troubleshoot everything accurately i am a bit more primitive like a beta version of google translate my brain has the ability to hyper focus on things that interest me for example once i had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages you may have noticed that i don 't have much inflection in my voice that 's why people often confuse me with a gps this can make basic communication a challenge unless you need directions a few years ago when i started doing i went to get head shots done for the first time the photographer told me to look flirty and i had no idea what she was talking about she said do that thing you know with your eyes when you 're flirting with guys searching for waldo there 's a reason for this as there is a reason that waldo is hiding laughter i have asperger 's form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display it 's made life difficult in many ways and growing up but i didn 't understand them my personal heroes were george carlin and stephen colbert and they my personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm needless to say i did not have many friends i was also hypersensitive to texture i can assure you that my hygiene and my parents things kind of got out of control when i was sexually assaulted by a peer and and i had to travel two thousand miles across the country to get i became paranoid and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me my family finally rescued me and was on the verge of suicide i went on to do incredible things one of the things with asperger 's is that and just a lot going on in my mind but there 's a gap between not many places would hire me due to my lack of social skills which is why i applied to waffle where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse as social norms would have it you should only go to waffle house at an ungodly hour in the night and i asked her what 's the most ridiculous thing that 's happened to you on the job and she told me that one time a man walked in completely naked laughter i said great sign me up for the graveyard shift needless to say waffle house did not hire me and it allows me to think innovatively at nineteen i won a research competition for my research on coral and i ended up speaking at the un convention of biological diversity presenting this research and i think there technology this technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder or asd released by my company has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills in addition to this it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates and it 's been a great help but it 's more than that there 's more that can be done for people with asd it has been speculated that many innovative scientists and engineers have it but the problem 's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can 't be shared and so many people with autism are being overlooked every day and they 're being taken advantage of so my dream for people with autism is to change that to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from one of the reasons i love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free without judgment of social and physical consequences and so i can do whatever i want you know i 'm making out with brad pitt and angelina is my goal is to shift people 's perspective of autism and people with asperger 's because there is a lot they can do i mean look at temple grandin we allow people to share their talents with this world and move thank you"
