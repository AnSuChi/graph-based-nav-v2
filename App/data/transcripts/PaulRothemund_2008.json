  "transcript": "and i don 't know the answer to that so i 'm not going to tell you i will say that life involves the program would execute and it could result you have to consider that chris anderson is a as is jim watson craig venter as are all of us and in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you but one to me that 's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development the output a small mutation can take a two wing fly and make it a four wing fly six fingered man now a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes if your bank account 's one dollar and you flip a single bit you could end up with a thousand dollars so these small changes are things that i think that they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is is underlying these amplified large changes and what i want to do is write molecular programs potentially to build technology and there are a lot of people doing this a lot of synthetic biologists doing this like craig venter and they concentrate on using cells so my friends molecular programmers and i have a sort of 're interested in using dna rna and protein and building new languages for building things from the bottom up using biomolecules potentially having nothing to do with biology motors that move your muscles trying to and in a high level language you 'll describe that cell phone then you 're going to have a compiler that 's going to take that description it 's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and it 'll build an electronic computer and if i haven 't revealed my prejudices already i think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers building electronic computers which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers which will build new electronic computers and so forth and if you buy all of this and you think life is about computation as i do then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist so one big question is how does a baby know when to stop growing and for molecular programming the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing or how does a computer program know when to stop running or more to the point how do you know if a program will ever stop there are other questions like this too one of them is craig venter turns out i think he 's actually a computer scientist he asked how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism how few genes can i use this is exactly analogous to the question what 's the smallest program i can write that will act exactly like microsoft word what 's the smallest number we can get away with now these are big questions in computer science these but for some tasks we can start to answer them so i 'm going to start asking those questions for the dna structures i 'm going to talk about next it 's double stranded it 's a double helix has the as ts cs and gs that pair to hold the strands together and i 'm going to draw it like this sometimes just so i don 't scare you we want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix when we synthesize it it comes single stranded so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube and they 're floppy when they 're single stranded you mix them together twenty five years ned seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of dna strands coming together but a lot of their approaches though elegant take a long time they can take a couple of years or it can be difficult to design so i came up with a new method a couple of but to but inside them they 're infected with a virus that this is part of that genome add a bunch of short synthetic dnas that i call staples each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place and a right half that binds it in a different place and brings the long now we can 't actually take a movie of this process but shawn douglas at harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it and what happens is that we mix these strands together we heat them up we add a little bit of salt we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down and as we cool them down the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure and you can see a little bit of double helix forming there you can see that what it really is even though you think it 's complicated is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other goes along one helix and binds it jumps to another helix and comes back that holds the long strand like this now to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted i tried to make this shape i wanted to fold dna into something that goes up over the eye down the nose up the nose and so i thought if this could work anything could work so i had the computer program design the short staples to do this i ordered them they came by fedex i mixed them up heated them cooled them down and i got fifty billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water so they 're all floating around in solution and to look at them you have to get them on a surface where they stick so you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick bumps up and down and feels the height of the first surface it feels the dna origami there 's the atomic force microscope working and you can see that the landing 's a little rough when you zoom in they 've got you know weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out but it 's pretty good unsolicited anyone know what this is what is it which even has taiwan and you can see it 's sort of on the world 's shortest leash right and you can make a map of the and what 's really neat about it nano circuits so you can put circuit components on the staples like a light bulb and a light switch let the thing assemble and you 'll get some kind of a circuit and then you can maybe wash the dna away and have the circuit left over so organized some carbon so so it 's very i want to get back to that compiler the dna origami is a proof that that compiler actually works start with something in the computer you get a high level description of the computer program a high level description of the origami you have your molecular compiler you can do whatever so ' worth of dna so we 're not going to do this we 're going to turn to another technology called algorithmic self assembly of tiles it and if you look at their sticky ends these little dna bits you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern so these tiles would make a complicated self assembling if you didn 't catch that is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output and a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs specifically counting so you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard so you can read off binary numbers five and in order to get these kinds of computations started right you need some kind of input a kind of seed you can use dna origami for that you can encode the number thirty two in the right hand side of a dna origami and when you add those tiles that count they will start to count it knows when to stop growing because it can count it knows how big it here 's the dna origami and what we can do is we can write thirty two on both edges you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and you 'll get but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger you have a very sensitive computer program where small changes single tiny little mutations developmental process if we wanted to make a square of size ten one hundred or one thousand if we used dna origami alone we would require a number of dna strands that 's the square of the size of that square so we 'd need one hundred ten thousand or a million dna strands that 's really not affordable plus some tiles that count then we can get away with using one hundred two hundred or three hundred dna strands and so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something to reduce the size of the genome genome that you 're building so if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles rather than to the the staple strands you affix them to the tiles then they 'll self assemble the somewhat complicated circuits the experimentally this is what we 've done in the and here are some tiles growing from it 's got some errors but at least it counts up and i in the next five or ten years we 'll make the kind of squares that i described and maybe even get to some of those what do i want you to take away from this talk i want you to remember that to create life 's very diverse and complex forms life uses computation to do that and the computations that it molecular computations and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it as feynman said you know we need to build something to understand it and so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing rebuild everything from the bottom up using dna in ways that nature never intended using dna origami and dna origami to seed this algorithmic what 's really neat about"
