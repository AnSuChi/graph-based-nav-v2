  "transcript": "and i witnessed as a reporter for al jazeera the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that then i was placed and that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship regime that for decades created a for decades decades we have lived under authoritarian regimes in the arab world in the middle east these regimes created something within us i have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents regimes that we have seen around us and for a moment i was wondering are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground a change that does not come through foreign intervention through the misery of occupation and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad and this is why they revolted this is why they did not accept would you like to see destruction would you like to see foreign troops on your land and the people thought for themselves maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in instead of having the second scenario that was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen for ten years unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting emerging from a magnificent piece of land a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years now i am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived a new generation connected inspired by universal values and a global understanding has created a new reality for us these young people who have restored who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets nothing happened nothing just step out of your house raise your voice and say we would like to see the end of the regime this is what happened in tunisia the tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies they they were surprised by all of these they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them bring them back home this is what they were telling this is their propaganda bring these kids home because they are misled these youth who have been inspired by universal values who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and same time realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it not using violence not trying to create chaos we in al jazeera and suddenly that newsroom in doha became a center that received all this kind of input but the connectivity in the arab world is very little because of many problems that we are suffering from but al jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [ it ] and then people started to feel that there 's and then egypt started and you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of how do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant internet but this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from and while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change before we thought and governments told us and even sometimes it was true that change was imposed on us and people rejected that because they thought that it is alien to their culture always we believed that change will spring from within that change should be a reconciliation connected with this is the right moment and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region how did the elite deal with that the so called political elite in front of facebook they brought the camels and then when they they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from tel aviv they started telling the west be aware of al qaeda al qaeda is taking over our territories these are islamists trying to create new imaras be aware of these people who [ are ] coming to you in order because this corrupt elite they could not and they cannot imagine how they could really deal with this reality they have been detached and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other al jazeera is not we are at the center of the coverage we were banned from egypt some of them were arrested but most of our they went underground in egypt voluntarily for eighteen days our cameras were broadcasting live the voices of the people in tahrir square i remember one night he told me we appeal to you not to switch off the cameras if you switch off the cameras tonight there will be a genocide you are protecting us by showing what is happening at tahrir square i felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to make your best not to switch off the cameras at night because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story and they feel protected as well so we have a chance we have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world let us not let us free ourselves especially in the west from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule to rule their future even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us moment in time is the best opportunity for the world for the west and the east rather than the images of violence and let us stand for them and let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance and the future is now i thank you very much is this but this is a story it is a great story it is beautiful it is not something that you only cover because you have to cover you are witnessing and this is what the story 's all about ca there are a lot of people in the west who are still skeptical or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos you really believe that if there are democratic elections in egypt now that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you 've spoken about so inspiringly the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational not to even the intellectual elite even opposition leaders including political parties the youth in the arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the we are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way what should people here here at ted here in the west do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what 's happening here wk i think we have discovered a very issue in the arab world that people care people care about this great transformation mohamed nanabhay who 's sitting with us the head of he told me that and people would like to know unfortunately in the united states we are not covering but washington d c at this moment in time for al jazeera english but i can tell you this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling universal feeling of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us well wadah a group of tedxcairo are meeting as we speak thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us thank you so much"
