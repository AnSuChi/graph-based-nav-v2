  "transcript": "and i came across my parents i did not know what they were laughing at but i wanted in i wanted to be part of that and i kind of sat around at the edge going hoo hoo now incidentally which was based around signs in toilets on trains telling you what you could and and the thing you have to remember about the english is of course we do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor at the time though i didn 't understand anything of that i just cared about the laughter and actually and it is a really weird thing to do what i 'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing so here we 've got some laughter for you the first one is pretty joyful i need him to breathe there 's a point in there where i 'm just like you 've got to get some air in there mate because he just sounds like he 's breathing out and laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientists don 't normally spend much time looking at which is the so you use the intercostal muscles the muscles between your ribs to bring air in and out of your lungs just by expanding and contracting your ribcage and if i was to put a strap around the outside of your chest called a breath belt and just look at that movement you see a rather gentle sinusoidal movement so that 's breathing you 're all doing don 't stop so what i 'm doing now is you see something much more like this in talking you use very fine movements of the ribcage to squeeze the air out and in fact we 're the only animals that can do this it 's why we can talk at all and that enemy is laughter because what happens when you laugh is those same muscles start to contract very regularly and you get this very marked sort of zig zagging and that 's just squeezing the air out of you it literally is that basic a way of making a sound you could be you can get these spasms and that 's when you start getting so it 's not at all unusual for example to hear people to say humans are the only animals that laugh nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh in fact you find laughter throughout the mammals it 's been well described and well observed in primates but you also see it in rats and wherever you find it humans primates rats you find it associated with things like tickling that 's the same for humans and wherever you find it it 's associated with interactions so robert provine who has done a lot of work on this has pointed out times more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you 're on your own and where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation so if you ask human beings when do you laugh they 'll talk about comedy and they 'll talk about humor and they 'll talk about jokes if you look at when they laugh they 're laughing with their friends you are laughing to show you can catch laughter from somebody else and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you and we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have so it seems possible that like my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song part of their interaction with you they are choosing to do this so i 've been looking at this in more detail and we got those same people to produce more posed social laughter so imagine your laughing because you like your friend but not really because the joke 's all that so i 'm going to play you a couple of those i want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter or if you think it 's posed so is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter was helpless laughter and in fact to record that all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening to something i knew she wanted to laugh at and i just started doing this what you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter they seem to be different things to us being different from social laughter you start squeezing air out from your lungs under much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily for example i could never pitch my voice that high to sing posed laughter we might think it sounds a bit fake actually it 's not it 's actually an important social cue we use it a lot we 're choosing to laugh in a lot of nasality in posed laughter that kind of ha ha ha ha ha sound that you never get you could not do if you were laughing involuntarily so they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things we took it into the scanner to see how brains respond when you hear laughter and when you do this and all they 're doing is lying listening to sounds we don 't which lies you hear sounds you would never hear in any other and it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing of these novel sounds in contrast when you hear somebody laughing which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing thinking about what somebody else is thinking and i think what that means is even if you 're having your brain scanned which is completely boring and not very interesting when you hear somebody going and here we just asked people two questions first of all they heard some laughs and they had to say how real or posed do these laughs sound the real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown you get better and better and better at spotting real laughter so six year olds are at chance they can 't really hear the difference you do not hit peak performance in this dataset until you are in your late 30s and early you don 't understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens you 're learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life the younger you are young and old finds the real laughs more contagious than the posed laughs behavior about which a lot of our but i 'm coming to see that actually there 's even more to laughter than it 's an important social emotion we should look at because it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced in terms of how we use laughter there into the lab and he 'll say to the husband tell me something that your wife does that irritates you and what you see is immediately just run that one through your head briefly you and your partner you can see physically people become more stressed what he finds is that the couples who manage that feeling of stress when you look at close relationships now i don 't think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships i think this is probably going to be a characteristic of close emotional relationships such as you might have with friends which explains my and it 's extremely macho and the mood is very serious and i want you to notice what happens in terms of laughter when things go wrong and how quickly that happens and how that changes the mood friends are already laughing they are already laughing hard the thing i really like about that is it 's all very serious until he and imagine if that had played him out with him standing there going no seriously heinrich i think this is broken we wouldn 't enjoy watching that that would be stressful or if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing and his friends are we weren 't jumping around on the ice in our underpants we 're not canadian these events are always difficult i had a relative who was being a bit difficult my mum was not in a good place and i can remember finding myself just before the whole thing started and i just thought at the time i don 't know why i 'm doing this and what i realized i was doing was i was coming up with something from somewhere i could use to make her laugh together with me and in fact all doing this all the time you do it so often you don 't even notice it and you 're doing something when you laugh with people that 's actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system that mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds and clearly to regulate emotions to make ourselves feel you and me baby ain 't nothing but mammals"
