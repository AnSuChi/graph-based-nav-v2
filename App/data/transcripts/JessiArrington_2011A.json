  "transcript": "but before i show you what i 've got inside i 'm going to make a very public confession and that is i get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores aww thank you secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment i get to meet all and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt i mean what am i going to find today is it going to be my size will i like the color i feel as though i 've won i want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what i brought seven pairs of underpants i was betting that i 'd be able to find and since you don 't know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear and i 'd really love to show you my week 's worth of outfits right now does that sound good so as i do cost me $ and it was the most expensive thing that i wore the entire week monday color is powerful it is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you 're wearing bright red pants if fitting in i 've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in they will appreciate it dress up or you think you look good in something you almost certainly do and if you don 't think you look good in something you 're also probably right and i 'm going to break it down for you for just a second if you believe so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience we should be able to rock anything we want to rock developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase before i go home to brooklyn i 'm going to donate everything back because the lesson i 'm trying to learn myself this week is that it 's okay to let go i don 't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner there is always going to be another crazy shiny outfit just waiting for me if i put a little love in my heart and look thank you very much"
