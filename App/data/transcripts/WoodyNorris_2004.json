  "transcript": "was working at the university of washington and i came up with an idea and it was an arm that instead of hinging and i got really lucky after that and without giving you too much of a tirade i want to talk to you about an invention i brought with me today golly i 'm just totally losing it my 44th patent about the 15th invention i call this hypersonic sound i 'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes but i want to make an analogy before i do to i usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say that 's really cool but what 's it good for what is the light bulb good for sound light i 'm going to draw the analogy when edison invented the light bulb pretty much looked like this hasn 't changed that much light came out of it in every direction focus it a little bit better now think about where the world would be today if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to and after almost eighty years of having those gadgets the sound just kind of goes where it wants even when you 're standing in front of a megaphone it 's pretty much every direction a little bit of differential but not much we wouldn 't have that or movies in general i have a couple of units that guy there was made for a demo i did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in detroit who wants to put them in a car small version over your head so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car i got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard now you 're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you maybe if i hit sound is being made right next to your ears is that cool applause because i have some limited time i 'll cut it off for a second and tell you about how it works and what it 's good for course like light it 's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack or the cornflakes or the toothpaste or a talking plaque in a they tried this back in the ' 60s and were too smart and so they gave up but they want to use it and though i did not graduate from college doesn 't mean i 'm stupid because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today too many other smart people out there so just happened to get my education in a little different way i 'm not at all against education i think it 's wonderful i think they get so smart they 're unwilling to look at things that they know better than i have this little slogan that i use a lot which is sony 's got this vision back to get myself on track that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket you 're going to watch a miss their commercials and reaches out turns off the sound and you know if the sound isn 't there the sale typically isn 't made it is safeways they 're trying this in three parts of the country right now from the tests that have been done is if you don 't want to hear it you take about one step to the side and you don 't hear it so we create silence as much as we create sound or someone is next to you asleep doesn 't hear it doesn 't wake up we 're also working on noise canceling canceling things like snoring noise from automobiles we expect by this time next year it 's not any more pricey than regular electronics now when i played it for you you didn 't hear the thunderous bass this unit that i played goes from about two hundred hertz to above the range of hearing and the sound that you 're hearing unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face is made out in front of it in the air you turn up the volume just a little bit i 'm talking about a little over eighty decibels it changes with temperature i 'm making a little sine wave here in the air well which means during the making of that sine wave the speed at which it is propagating is shifting all of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more linearity means higher quality sound it 's one hundred percent based on it 's a corrupting effect of the sound the ultrasound in this case that 's emitted but it 's so predictable that you can produce very it 's made at literally billions and so when i aim it towards you what you hear is made right next to i can put it so that one ear hears one speaker the other ear hears the other when you listen to stereo on your home system turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you 're hearing it also in your right ear so the stage is more restricted the sound stage that 's supposed to spread out in front of you it does not follow the inverse square law which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row now we 've been as i say very successful very lucky in having companies catch the vision of this from cars car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids and a separate system in the back oh no the kids aren 't driving today i was seeing if you were listening actually i haven 't had breakfast yet and maybe there 's a little dvd player in the back for the kids don 't want to be bothered with that or their rap music or whatever so again this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on we 've got the military have just deployed some of these into iraq where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift from one hundred yards away when they play this thing so another way of hopefully determining who 's friendly and who isn 't pain is one hundred and twenty so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people and there can be a public beach just off to the side and they don 't even know it 's turned on and they 're buying them as fast as we can make them we put it on a turret looked up at the ceiling of my office one day i was working on a ground penetrating radar project and my physicist ceo came in and said we have a real problem we 're using very short wavelengths we 've got a problem with the antenna ringing and there 's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we 're trying to analyze taking too much processing i says why turn it on turn it off that 's a fluorescent tube refined i just sold that for a million and a half dollars cash i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then i took them back a demo and they bought any of you ever wore a jabber headphone the little cell headphones that 's my invention i sold that for seven million dollars big mistake it just sold for eighty million dollars two years ago i actually drew that up on a little crummy mac computer in my attic at my house and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design i drew way back when i 'm the happiest guy you 're ever going to meet and my dad died before he realized anybody in the you 've been a great audience i know i 've jumped all over the place i usually figure out what my talk is when i get up in front of a group"
