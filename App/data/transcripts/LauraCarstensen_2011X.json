  "transcript": "and societies are getting grayer sometimes i 'm concerned that we hear about it so much that but make no mistake longer lives can and i believe will improve quality of life now to put this in perspective let me just zoom out for a minute more years were added to average life expectancy in the century than all years added across all prior millennia of human evolution combined we nearly doubled the length of time that we 're living it 's brand new and because fertility rates fell across that very same period that life expectancy was going up that pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population with many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people who make it and survive to old age is being reshaped and now if you 're the kind of person who can get chills from population statistics these are the ones that should do it because what that means is that for the first time in the history of the species the majority of babies born in the developed world are having the no genetically hardier than our ancestors were ten thousand years ago this increase in life expectancy is the remarkable product of culture the crucible that holds science and technology and changes in behavior that improve health and well being through cultural changes our ancestors largely largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives now there are problems associated with aging but the more we learn about aging the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate aging brings some rather remarkable improvements increased knowledge expertise and emotional aspects of life improve that 's right older people are happy cdc recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week and fewer stress worry anger all decrease with age so we 've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding we 've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people are and always have been the greatest generations we 've asked well maybe older people are just trying to put a positive spin on an otherwise depressing existence but the more we 've tried to disavow this finding the more evidence we find to support it years ago my colleagues and i embarked on a study where we followed the same group of people over a 10 year period originally the sample was aged eighteen to ninety four and we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed as they grew older our participants would carry electronic pagers for a week at a them throughout the day and evenings at random times and every time we paged them we 'd ask them to answer several questions on a one to seven scale how happy are you right now how sad are you right now how frustrated are you right now and using this intense study of individuals we find that it 's not one particular generation that 's doing better than the others but the same individuals over time come to report relatively greater positive and there is a slight downturn but at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood now it 's really too simplistic to say that older people are happy in our study they are more positive but they 're also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions sadness at the same time you experience happiness you know that tear in the eye when you 're smiling at a friend and other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness more comfortably accepting of sadness than younger people are and we suspect that this may help to explain why older people are better than than younger people at solving hotly charged emotional conflicts and debates but not despair and all things being equal older people direct their cognitive resources like attention and memory to positive information more than negative but not younger people remember we 've asked older and younger people to view faces in laboratory studies some frowning some smiling older people look toward the smiling faces and away from the frowning angry faces in day to day life this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction but as social scientists we continue to ask about possible alternatives we 've said well maybe older people report more positive emotions because they 're cognitively impaired we 've said could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions and so you switch to the positive emotions but that 's not the case the most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect the most so we 've found that these changes are grounded fundamentally in the uniquely human ability to monitor time and if there 's a paradox of aging when time horizons are long and nebulous as they typically are in youth people are constantly preparing trying to soak we might spend time with people we don 't even like because it 's somehow interesting we might learn something unexpected we go on blind dates you know after if it doesn 't work out there 's always tomorrow people over fifty don 't go on blind dates when we recognize that we don 't have all the time in the world we see our priorities most we savor life we 're more appreciative more open to reconciliation we invest in more emotionally important parts of life and life gets better so we 're happier day to day but that same shift in perspective leads us to have less tolerance than ever for by two thousand and fifteen there will be more people in the united states over the age of sixty than under fifteen what will happen to societies that are top heavy with older people the numbers won 't determine the outcome culture will if we invest in science and technology and find solutions for the real problems that older people face and we capitalize on the very real strengths then added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life societies with millions of talented emotionally stable citizens who are healthier and better educated than any generations before them armed with knowledge about the practical matters of life and motivated to solve the big issues my father who is ninety two likes to say let 's stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking about how to get them to save us all"
