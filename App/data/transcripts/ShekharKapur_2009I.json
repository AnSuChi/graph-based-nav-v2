  "transcript": "and we 're all talking about this great english icon and saying she 's a fantastic woman she does everything how are we going to introduce her so we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer and they came we hire him for and the third said let 's find another director i thought i had better change so we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce elizabeth and i said ok maybe i am too bollywood maybe elizabeth this great icon dancing what are you talking about and then we all came to a consensus and here was the introduction of this great british icon and she was youthful and the power of not knowing when i go out to direct a film every day we prepare too much we think too much in the quicksand of of experience getting rid of this mind that says hey you know what you 're doing you know exactly what you 're doing you 're a director it 's a symbolic gesture i tear up the script i go and i get scared i 'm doing it right now you can watch me i 'm getting nervous i don 't know what to say i don 't know what i 'm doing i don 't want to go there and as i go there i 'm hoping some some moments of truth will come and if you get five great moments of great organic stuff in your storytelling in your film your film audiences will get it and i 'm standing there and saying and everybody 's saying what 's the first thing what 's going to happen and so you don 't know and so because you don 't know you 're praying to the universe because you 're praying to the universe that something i 'm going to try and access the universe the way einstein say a prayer accessed his equations the same source i 'm looking for the same source because creativity comes from absolutely the same source that you meditate somewhere outside yourself you 're looking for something that comes and hits you until that hits you you 're not going to do the first shot so what do you do so great actor and i like to give to my actors why don 't you show me what you want to do and i follow all the time is panic panic is the great access of creativity because that 's the only way to get rid of your mind rid of your mind get out of it get it out and let 's go to the universe because there 's something out there that is more truthful than your mind that is more truthful than your universe [ unclear ] used to live we used to call it a chhat or the khota khota 's now become a bad word it means their terrace and we used to sleep out at night and i was told that that if there is something that exists then it is measurable and at night i would lie out looking at the unpolluted and i would think daddy how far does the universe go and he said son it goes on forever so i said please measure forever because in school they 're teaching me that if i cannot measure it it does not exist into my frame of reference but i remember the story there was a woodcutter and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax and when that ax hits that piece of wood and then when i would run out of that story i would imagine that woodcutter 's universe is one atom and so i got over the problem how did i do it a story is our all of us in this where we live with this duality of whether we exist or not and who are we the stories we tell ourselves are the stories that we are the stories we tell ourselves so that 's as wide as we look at stories a story is the relationship that you develop between who you are or who you are and the infinite world and that 's our mythology we tell our stories and a person without a story does not exist so einstein told a story and he went out to conquer the world we all everybody has a story that they follow we tell ourselves stories so i will go further and i say we create stories to define our existence if we do not create the stories we but that 's what i 've done all the time now a film i often wonder when i make a film i 'm thinking of making a film of the buddha and i often wonder if buddha had all the elements that are given to a director if he had visuals if he had a video camera would we get i have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way but when i first went to hollywood they said i used to talk about subtext and my agent came to me would you kindly not talk about subtext and just talk about plot and say how wonderful you 'll shoot the film it is not necessary that these stories what is wonderful is at many times there will be a truth in it but it may contradict the plot but don 't worry about it here was a story that the writer was telling a woman who was threatened by philip ii and was going to war and was going to war fell in love with walter raleigh because she fell in love with walter raleigh she and then walter raleigh fell in love with her lady and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted here 's the story i was telling the gods up there there were two people there was philip ii who was divine but not quite divine because she thought she was divine but but the divine one was unjust what we need to do is help the just one and so they helped the just one and what they did was they sent walter raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self and the mortal self was the girl that walter raleigh was sent and gradually he separated her so she was free to be and the two divine people fought and the gods were on the side of divinity of course all the british press got really upset i was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film of course when i asked cate blanchett i said what 's the film about she said the film 's about a woman coming to terms with growing older psychological the writer said it 's about history plot the gods so let me show you a film she was at the depths of mortality and she 's recognizing the dangers of mortality both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body one the mortal self and one you go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business is it his tell me say it this man has seduced a ward of the queen and she has married without royal consent these offenses are punishable by law what am i doing with the architecture the architecture is telling a story the architecture 's bigger the stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic it 'll survive her so it 's telling you to me stone is part of her destiny not only that why is the camera looking down the camera 's looking down at her because she 's in the well she 's in the absolute well of her own sense of of but that 's the moment she 's surgically removing herself from that so the film is operating on many many levels in that and at each level it 's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other so what 's the process of telling a story about ten years ago i heard this little thing from a politician not a and he said that that these people in the cities in one flush expend as much water as you people in the rural areas don 't get for your family for two days that and he made me wait in his apartment in malabar hill on the twentieth floor and an idea started what kind of world do i create and where does the idea the design of that come so in my mind in the future they started to build flyovers you understand flyovers and the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities about ten to twelve percent of the people have moved to the upper city now where it says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor so from that mythology the upper city and lower city come so the design has a story suck up if you give us what [ we want ] we 'll give you water but i can go on about telling you how we evolve stories and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated everything 's a contradiction and all of us are constantly looking for harmony when you get up the night and day is a contradiction but you get up at four a m that first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each in a poet 's mind it 's a conflict of words in the universe 's mind between day and night in the mind of a man and a woman constantly at the contradiction between male and female we 're looking for harmony within each other the problem with a lot of the storytelling in hollywood and as [ unclear ] was saying in his that we try to resolve the contradiction harmony harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal so that storytelling like all other contradictions in the universe is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions resolving one but letting another go letting another go go and creating a question that is really important"
