  "transcript": "metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others but metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words the reigning king of the metaphorians a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself referring to none other than elvis presley now all shook up is a great love song it 's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract ideas emotions feelings concepts thoughts we inevitably resort to metaphor in all shook up a touch is not a but a chill but a buttercup and love is not love but being all shook up in this elvis is following aristotle 's classic definition of metaphor this is the mathematics of metaphor and fortunately it 's very simple x equals but so does shakespeare in this famous line from romeo and juliet juliet is the sun here shakespeare gives the thing juliet a name that belongs to whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else we give it a whole network of analogies too and metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of juliet than if shakespeare had literally described what she looks like the first step is pattern recognition look at this image what do you see three wayward pac men and three pointy brackets are actually present what we see however are two overlapping triangles second step conceptual such as colored hearing people with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters we all have synesthetic abilities this is the bouba kiki test what you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called and the sharp spiky one as kiki can we do a quick show of hands does that correspond okay i think ninety nine point nine would about cover it why do we do that because we instinctively and the spiky shape and many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic silence is sweet sexually unattractive people leave metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia in which we understand one concept in the context of another third step is cognitive dissonance this is the stroop test what you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed you if you 're like most you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink the test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well the participants had to identify as quickly as possible the literally false sentences they took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either one of the sentences was some jobs are jails and the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false metaphor matters because it 's around us every day the time metaphor matters because it creates expectations pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing as in the nasdaq climbed higher object metaphors describe price movements as non living the dow fell like a brick researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries and then predict the next day 's price trend and they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal if for example say in taking out mortgages they really can 't afford that but this is how metaphor misleads metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies and they had to make a decision what should they do intervene appeal to the u n or do nothing they were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy and the third was historically neutral those exposed to the world war ii scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor or make a discovery we compare what we know with what we don 't know and the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like like the former einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play he famously used thought experiments which are essentially elaborate analogies to come up with some of his greatest discoveries by bringing together what we know and what we don 't know through analogy metaphorical thinking strikes the spark that ignites discovery now but you just have to look at the words around you and you 'll find it ralph waldo emerson described language as fossil poetry but before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor take the three most famous words in all of western philosophy therefore i am but there is a better translation the latin word cogito is derived from the prefix therefore i am"
