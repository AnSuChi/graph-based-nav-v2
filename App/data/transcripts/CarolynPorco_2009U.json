  "transcript": "two years ago here at ted i reported that we had discovered at saturn with the cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small saturnine moon enceladus seen here this region seen here for the first time in the cassini image taken in two thousand and five and seen just recently in late two thousand and eight here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere and i also reported that we 'd made this consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself were so exciting that in the intervening two years we have focused more on enceladus we 've flown the cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times flying closer and deeper into these and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported while they 're not amino acids we 're now finding things like propane and benzene hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain we are very encouraged by these results and we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon under the south pole an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms and that will have to await the arrival back at specifically equipped to address that particular question but in the meantime i invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to thank you"
