  "transcript": "i wrote a letter sharing some of the problems and warren buffet had recommended i do that being honest about what was going well what wasn 't and making it kind of an annual thing a goal i had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems because i think there are some very important problems that don 't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the governments to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to and part of the reason i i feel that way is looking at the past over the perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths and twenty million of those died before the age of five one hundred million children were born so more and less than ten million of them died before the age of five so that 's a factor of two reduction for example measles was four million of the deaths so we really can make changes the next breakthrough and i think that 's doable in why well there 's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths pneumonia so that brings us to the the first problem that i 'll raise this morning which is how do we stop a deadly disease that 's spread by mosquitos well what 's the history of this disease it 's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact if we look at the genetic code only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the united states it was in europe people didn 't know what caused it until so it was everywhere and two tools helped bring the death rate down one was killing the mosquitos with ddt the other was treating the patients now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where the rich countries are so we can see one thousand nine hundred it 's everywhere one thousand nine hundred and forty five it 's still most places one thousand nine hundred and seventy the u s and most of europe have gotten rid of it one thousand nine hundred and ninety you 've gotten most of the northern areas and more recently you can see it 's just around the equator and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries it doesn 't get much investment for example there 's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness it 's a terrible thing and so that 's why that priority but malaria even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over two hundred million people at any one time are suffering from it it means that you can 't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so i brought some here just so you could experience this we 'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit there 's no reason only poor people should have come up with a few new things and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night so the mosquitos that bite late at night can 't get at them and when you use indoor spraying it 's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves so every tool that we 've ever had in the past and so you end up with two or if you go in kind of but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again bed net funding is up and that should save over two thirds of the lives 're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn 't give us the road map because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things it involves communicators to keep but ninety we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together i 'm quite optimistic that we will be able now let me turn and this is how do you make a teacher great it seems like the kind of question that and the answer is really that we don 't well all of us here we all had a wonderful education that 's part of the reason we 're here today part of the reason we 're successful i can say that even though i 'm a college drop out i had great teachers the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top twenty percent of students have gotten a good education and those top twenty percent and they 've gone on to create the revolutions in software and and biotechnology and keep the u s at the forefront strength for those top twenty percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting and if you look at the economy and we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are are driven by advanced education like and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and and compared it to the number who finished senior year because they weren 't tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts had taken place before that they had to raise and even if you graduate from high school if you and that doesn 't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better we 've funded scholarships we 've done things in libraries but the more we looked at it the more we realized and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher what does that mean that means that if the entire u s for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between us and asia would go away so it 's simple all you need are those top quartile teachers should retain those people we should find out what they 're doing and transfer that skill to other people but i can tell you that absolutely and the answer is no once somebody has taught for three years the variation is very very small you might think these are people with master 's degrees they 've gone back and they 've gotten their master 's of education which says there 's no effect at all is a master 's degree the way the pay system works because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension the second is but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher teach for america and we 've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it you might say do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher 's leave and it 's a system with now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a it 's an unbelievable thing they have sixty six schools mostly middle schools some high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different they 're team teaching they 're constantly improving their teachers they 're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase i sat down and i thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the energy energy the sports rally or something what 's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren 't paying attention which kids were bored and calling kids rapidly putting things up on the board because particularly in those middle school years fifth through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who who doesn 't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so kipp is doing it how does that compare to a normal school well in a normal school teachers aren 't told how good they are the data isn 't gathered in the teacher 's contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes to once per year and they need advanced notice to do that so imagine running a factory where you 've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher who wants to improve doesn 't have the tools to do it they don 't have the test scores and there 's a whole thing of of trying to block the data for example new york passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision but i 'm optimistic about this i think there are some clear things we can do and that allows us to understand who 's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital video is cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say ok here 's a little clip of something i thought i did well advise me when this kid acted up how should i have dealt with that and they could all sit and work together you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics but you could make it so that dvds were now there 's a book actually about kipp the the place that this is going on that jay matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice and i thought it was so fantastic it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does i 'm going send everyone here a free copy of this book and i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have in fact we have in the stimulus bill it 's interesting the house version actually had money in it for these data systems and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things but i i 'm optimistic i think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference there 's a lot more problems like that pneumonia i can just see you 're getting excited just at the the very name of these things and the skill sets required governments don 't naturally so it 's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and with that i think there 's some great things that will come out of it"
