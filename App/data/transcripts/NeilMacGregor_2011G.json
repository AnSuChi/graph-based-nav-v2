  "transcript": "the things we make have one supreme quality they live longer than us we perish they survive we have one life they have many lives and in each life they can mean different things which means that while we all have one biography they have many i want this morning to talk about the story the biography or rather the biographies of one particular object and it 's been fashioned into a cylinder covered with close writing and as you can see it 's been knocked about a bit which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in and it 's the story begins in the the removal of a despotic ruler and i want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with belshazzar 's feast because we 're talking about the iran iraq war of five hundred and thirty nine bc and the parallels between the events of five hundred and thirty nine bc and two thousand and three and in between are startling what you 're looking at is rembrandt 's painting now in the national gallery in london illustrating the text from the prophet daniel in the hebrew scriptures not only the jews belshazzar decides to have a feast and he brings out the temple vessels he 's already at war with the and that night daniel tells us at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall you are weighed in the balance and found wanting and your kingdom is handed over to the medes and the persians and that very night it 's a great story it 's story we all know the writing on the wall is part of our everyday language and it 's where our cylinder enters the story king of the persians has entered babylon without a fight falls to cyrus and that is what this cylinder is the declaration made by the ruler guided by god who had toppled the iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people king of the four quarters of the world they 're not shy of hyperbole as you can see this is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that p r consultants and what is the great king the powerful king the king of the four quarters of the world going to do he will at once let all the peoples that the babylonians nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar have captured and enslaved he will let them all recover the gods the statues the temple vessels that had been confiscated all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home and they 'll take with this is the decree this object is the evidence weeping when they remembered jerusalem king of persia ' all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem who is there among you of his people the lord god be with him and let him go up ' the central element still of the notion of return a central part of the life of judaism as you all know that return from exile reported for us in hebrew in scripture and in babylonian in clay two great texts what about the politics what was going on the empire of iran the medes and the persians became the first great world empire cyrus begins in the 530s bc and by the time of his son darius the whole of the eastern mediterranean is under persian control the middle east as we now know it and it 's what shapes the middle east as we now know it it was the empire the world had known until then much more important it was the first multicultural multifaith state and it had to recognize their different habits different peoples different religions different faiths all of those are respected by cyrus cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational multifaith and the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen and which survived for two hundred years of stability it left a dream of the middle east as a unit and a unit where people of different faiths could live together the greek invasions ended that and of course alexander couldn 't sustain a government and it fragmented but what cyrus represented remained absolutely central the greek historian xenophon wrote his book cyropaedia promoting cyrus as the great ruler and throughout cyrus remained the model this is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was and xenophon 's book on cyrus on how you ran a diverse society jefferson was a great admirer the ideals of cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state falls into ruins and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost until museum exhibition digging in babylon 19th century are the scriptures reliable can we trust them we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures no other evidence this appeared and great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution by geology here was evidence that the scriptures but the interpretation was rather more complicated because the cylinder account and the hebrew bible account differ in one key respect the babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of bablyon marduk and not surprisingly they tell you that all this was done by marduk marduk we hold called cyrus by his name marduk takes cyrus by the hand calls him to shepherd his people marduk tells cyrus that he will do these great generous things of setting the people free and this is why we should all be grateful to and worship marduk the hebrew writers in the old testament you will not be surprised to learn take a rather different view of this for them of course it can 't possibly by marduk that made all this happen it can only be and so in isaiah we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this not to marduk but to the lord god of israel the lord god of israel who also called cyrus by name also takes cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his it 's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event two different religious takeovers of a political fact and the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion and it 's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah and there 's a slight sense that isaiah knows this because he says this is god speaking of course i have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me i think it 's recognized that cyrus doesn 't realize that he 's acting under orders from jehovah cyrus is a good iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts real politics of the contemporary world the year of the balfour declaration and the response to this by the jewish population in eastern and across eastern europe jews display pictures of cyrus and of george v side by side the two great rulers who have allowed the return to jerusalem and the cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen is part of a divine plan you all know what happened happened the and fifty years later in the late 60s it 's clear that britain 's role as the imperial power is over and so the shah invents an iranian history or a return to iranian history that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the cyrus cylinder he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the british museum goes to tehran and is part of those great celebrations of the pahlavi dynasty we 're not interested in that history we 're interested in islamic iran attacks it becomes critical for the iranians to remember their great past their great past when they fought iraq and won it becomes critical to find a symbol not so when the british museum and tehran national musuem cooperate and work together as we 've been doing the iranians ask for one thing only as a loan it 's the only object they want they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder and last year the cyrus cylinder went to tehran it 's shown being presented here put into its case by the director of the national mrs ardakani it 's seen in tehran by between one and two million people this is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the west and it 's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means what cyrus means but above all cyrus as articulated through this cylinder zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed very proud of thousands of jews living in iran came to tehran to see it it became a great emblem a great subject of debate about what iran is at home and abroad is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed will iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated and it was all put together in a great pageant here you see this out sized cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of iran it was a narrative presented by the president himself and for me to take this object to iran to be allowed to take this object to iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate and it will continue to rumble because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration it is a document that can mean so many things for iran and for the region a replica of this is at the united nations in new york this autumn it will be and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures certainly in many more middle eastern stories and what story of the middle east what story of the world do you want to see reflecting what is said what is expressed in cylinder the right of peoples to live together in the same state worshiping differently freely a middle east a world in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate shrill but i think it 's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all them may well be the voice of this mute thing the cyrus cylinder"
