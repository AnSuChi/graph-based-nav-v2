  "transcript": "most likely largest inventions of our generation they also turned out to be the perfect tools it turned out that the capability to collect data information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we 've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about western watching over the rest of the world we 've heard about these starting with the top secret classified information from and we started learning about things like prism and these are examples of the kinds of programs u s intelligence agencies and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell well it turns out that george orwell was an optimist we are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined due to be opened and it 's a pretty big building how big well i can give you the numbers one hundred and forty thousand square meters but that doesn 't really tell you very much maybe it 's better to imagine it as a comparison you think about the largest ikea store you 've ever been this is five times larger how many hard drives can you fit in an ikea store right it and this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever keep it for and this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all and what this is is that it is wholesale wholesale blanket surveillance well not exactly intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners and monitoring foreigners doesn 't sound too bad until you realize that i 'm a foreigner and you 're a foreigner in fact ninety six percent of the planet but even i agree that some surveillance is fine if the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer trying to catch and to intercept his internet communications i 'm not arguing that at all but that 's not what programs like prism are about so the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this well the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations there 's nothing new here that 's not true don 't let anybody tell you because we did not know this already we didn 't know about prism we but now we do and we did not know and what that means nobody can decrypt that file even so that 's basically perfectly safe uncrackable you take something which is that good making all of us less secure as an end result a real world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because you know bad people might have house alarms but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result but of course these intelligence agencies are doing their job this is what they have been told to do do signals intelligence monitor they 're trying to find ways around the encryption one way is to sabotage encryption algorithms which is a great example and they should be brought back so what do we actually know about the leaks everything is based on the files leaked by mr snowden the very first prism slides from the beginning of june detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to they even have a specific date so for example they name the collection from microsoft started on september eleven two thousand and seven they all say yet we have these files so is one of the parties lying or is there some other alternative explanation and one explanation would be that these parties these service providers they 've been hacked that would explain it they aren 't cooperating they 've been hacked in this case they 've been hacked by their own government that might sound subverted the security of the windows update network meaning here the company was hacked and there 's more evidence supporting this theory as well leaked more information about the operations run by and inside gchq which is the u k equivalent it 's called nac network analysis centre and what this really means is that an e u country 's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow and they discuss it in their slides completely casually they even use cheesy powerpoint clip art like you know success when they gain access to services like this what the hell then there 's the argument and maybe that 's true sweden i 'm speaking of sweden because sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the united states how many swedish and then we turn it around how many american do have the occasional european success story even those then typically end up being sold to the united states like skype used to be secure it used to be end to end encrypted so once again we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose making all of us less secure as an it 's the war on terror you shouldn 't worry about it but these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of european leaders to tap the email of residents of mexico and brazil to read email traffic inside the united nations headquarters and e u terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them are the americans ready to throw away the constituion and throw it in the trash just because and the same thing with the bill of rights and all the amendments and the universal declaration of human rights and the conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat we are ready to do anything at all and whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn 't thought about this long enough please make sure that 's the first thing you tell me because then i know that i should not trust you with any secrets because obviously you can 't keep a secret but people are brutally honest with the internet and when these leaks yet i have nothing that i would in particular like to share with and when the leaks started the very first thing i tweeted about this was a comment about how when you 've been using search engines you 've been potentially leaking what am i sending to worry about this am i sending naked pictures or something privacy is nonnegotiable it should be built in to all the systems we use and one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines in five minutes we are more honest with search engines than we are with our families search engines know more about you than your family members know about you and and surveillance changes history we know this through examples of corrupt presidents like nixon imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available ms dilma rousseff she was one of the targets of nsa surveillance her email was read and she spoke there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion and and to quote a fellow security researcher so we are back to the age of and we the foreign users of the internet we should think about americans as our masters he 's been blamed for many things some are blaming him for causing problems for the u s cloud industry and software companies with these revelations and blaming snowden for causing problems for the u s cloud industry would be the and it 's but that 's not going to really change the situation what 's going to change the situation for the rest of the world how do you do that a but maybe you don 't have to do it alone maybe you can do it together with other countries the solution is open source free secure systems we can go around such surveillance haroon meer free open source systems will become the tide that will lift all of us up thank you very much"
