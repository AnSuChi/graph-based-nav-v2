  "transcript": "does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented doctors aren 't going to be walking around with and that 's part of the change in medicine what has changed our society but the future are digital medical this is an electrocardiogram and as a cardiologist to think that you could see in real time a patient an individual anywhere in the world on your you check your email while you 're sitting here your heart rhythm your blood pressure your oxygen your this is already available today this is airstrip technologies it 's now wired or i should say wireless by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital in the intensive care unit and putting it on a smartphone for physicians and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy and then as we go further today we have continuous glucose sensors right now they are under the skin but in the future and of course the desired range trying to keep glucose between seventy five and less than two hundred checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor you 'll see how that can impact diabetes is that dark green and this is ability in real time to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure through a band aid what i 've talked about are physiologic metrics but what i want to and the breath sounds introduced by g e is a handheld ultra sound why is this important because this is so much more sensitive and also a cardiac echo so we 're not just talking about physiologic metrics the key measurements of vital signs and all those things in physiology but also all the imaging the holter monitor this is now a little tiny patch now how does this and this sends a signal as today many of these things are dedicated gateways because they are not so well integrated back to the patient basically very simplistic technology of how this works now i have this device on i didn 't want to take my and because this device measures seven things that are very much vital signs for monitoring someone with heart failure and why is this important well this is the most expensive bed we can first of all heart failure is the number one the cost of heart failure is thirty seven billion dollars a which is eighty percent related to hospitalization and in the course of thirty days after a hospital stay for a medicare greater than sixty five years or older is twenty seven percent are readmitted in thirty days and by but that 's a why has this all of a sudden become a reality an exciting direction in the future of medicine what we have is in a way a perfect positive storm this sets up let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you 're not aware of it one point two million americans have gotten a nike shoe and this wired magazine cover article really captured a lot of this it talked a lot about the nike shoe and how quickly that 's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure here are some things the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind this was from july this cover article it 's about tracking every facet of life from sleep to mood to pain i tried this device but i got the fitbit that looks like this it 's like a wireless accelerometer pedometer and i want to just give you the results of that testing because i wanted to understand about the consumer movement i hope the by the way the phillips direct you exercise and it picks up the exercise you put in your height and weight it calculates bmi and course it tells you how many calories you 're expending but it really wants you to enter all your activity and so i went to this and of course i was gratified that it picked up the forty two minutes of exercise elliptical exercise i did but then it wants more information so it says how long did you do it tagged to a very nice alarm clock by the it monitors your brainwaves continuously when you 're sleeping so i did this thing for seven this is an important part of our life one third you 're supposed to be sleeping of course how many here have any problems with sleeping it 's so you tell me you sleep better than expected and you get a z q is adjusted to age and you want to get as high as you possibly can so this is the sleep and you see that z q there was 80 odd and because it not only helps you tell you 're awake eric i want to talk i want to talk and i 'm trying to play possum this thing is very very impressive ok and and all this sort of thing this was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep so it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group it 's and i didn 't think i was a very good sleeper but actually i did better than average in and the key thing was what i didn 't know now let 's move from sleep to diseases eighty percent of americans have chronic disease or eighty percent of age greater than sixty five have and eighty percent of our one point five whatever trillion expenditures are twenty four million people have diabetes and here is the latest map it was published just a little more than a week ago in the new york times and it isn 't looking good that is for men twenty nine percent in the country over sixty have type ii diabetes and women although it 's less it 's terribly high but of course we have a way to measure that now on and also hypoglycemia and you can see the red so let me just give you very quickly ten top targets for wireless medicine there 's five million people affected and you can check vital signs activity balance asthma depression there 's a diabetes i 've just mentioned heart failure we already talked about hypertension seventy four million people could have continuous blood pressure monitoring to to come up with much better management and prevention and this article from the economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people more quickly than any previous technology and that 's before we got going the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling the full spectrum of disease i hope i 've given you a sense of that across the globe there are two things that can really accelerate this whole process one of them we 're very fortunate is to develop a dedicated institute and that 's work that started with the work that scripps and then the great fortune of meeting up with gary and mary west to get behind this wireless health one hundred of which or more are working in wireless health the wireless institute the west wireless health institute is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening gary and mary west and i 'd like to give it up for them for getting behind and and what it 's trying to do is accelerate this era to take unmet medical needs to work and innovate we just appointed the chief engineer mehran mehregany it was announced on monday then to move up with development healthcare policy healthcare economics the other big thing besides having this fantastic institute to catalyze this process is guidance and that 's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital if we understand biology from genomics and omics and wireless through physiologic phenotyping but this is quite extraordinary but the future we can now tell who 's going to get type ii diabetes from all the common variants and that 's going to get filled in more with low frequency variants in the future we can tell who 's going to get breast cancer from the various genes we can also know who 's likely to get atrial fibrillation each of these has a sensor we can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it we can prevent or have the earliest detection possible for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient i hope i 've convinced you of this of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more it 's really taking individualized individualized medicine to a new height and it and i think it represents the black swan of medicine thanks for your attention"
