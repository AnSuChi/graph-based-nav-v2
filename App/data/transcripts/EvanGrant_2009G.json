  "transcript": "one of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature and trying to find hidden it seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere all around us everything gives out some kind of data whether it 's sound or smell or vibration through my work i 've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this and so now cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water as you can see there galileo the english scientist robert hook and then ernest covering it with sand and then bowing it john stewart reed he 's kindly recreated for us the chladni experiment what we can see here is the metal sheet this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate as you can see with your own eyes so for me cymatics is an almost magical tool it 's like a looking glass into a hidden world through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen devices like the cymascope which you can see here have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns and the list of scientific applications is growing every day for example in oceanography a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams and hopefully in the future we 'll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate we can also use cymatics for healing and education this is an installation developed with school children where their hands are tracked it allows them to control and position cymatic patterns and the reflections that are caused by them we can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form this image here is created from a snippet of beethoven 's ninth so it kind of flips things on its head a little bit this is pink floyd 's machine playing in real time through the cymascope so for example here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature so what does this all mean well there is still a lot to explore in its early days and there 's not many people working in this field but consider for a moment that sound does have form we 've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter then sort of and if we kind of ponder on that then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself the substance of things not seen"
