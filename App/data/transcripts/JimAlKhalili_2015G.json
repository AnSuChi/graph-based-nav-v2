  "transcript": "like to introduce you to an emerging area of science one that is still speculative quantum biology asks a very simple question does quantum mechanics that weird and wonderful and powerful theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry in other words are there processes mechanisms phenomena in in living organisms that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics now quantum biology isn 't new it 's been around since the early 1930s but it 's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments in biochemistry labs using spectroscopy quantum biology brings together quantum physicists biochemists molecular biologists it 's a very interdisciplinary field i come from quantum physics so i 'm a a nuclear physicist i 've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics so i sort of feel happy that i 'm still astonished by it that 's a good thing it means i study the very smallest structures in the universe the building blocks of of reality if we think about the scale of size start with an everyday object like the tennis ball and just go down orders of magnitude in size from the eye of a needle down to a cell down to now nanotechnology may be a term you 've heard of a nanometer is a billionth of a meter my area is the atomic nucleus which is the tiny dot inside an atom it 's even smaller biologists in my view they are very happy with their models of molecules nowadays they have very powerful computers that will simulate quantum mechanics was developed in the it is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas and it 's a world that 's very different from our everyday world made up of trillions of atoms it 's a world built on probability it 's a fuzzy world it 's a world of phantoms where particles can also behave like spread out waves if we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics then as the fundamental foundation of reality itself then after all it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules organic chemistry scaled up in complexity which of course leads to life itself so in a way it 's sort of not surprising it 's almost trivial you say well of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics but ultimately there quantum biology isn 't this obvious of course quantum mechanics underpins life at quantum biology is about looking for the non trivial the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics and to see if they do indeed play an important role in describing the processes of life here is my perfect example of the this is the quantum skier he seems to be intact he seems to be perfectly healthy and yet he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time this happens all the time particles can multitask they can be in two places at once they can do more than one thing at the same time it 's almost like magic physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness i don 't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics you see and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs we we carry out our experiments in vacuums we try and isolate it from any external disturbance noisy environment of a living cell biology itself if you think of molecular biology seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry chemical reactions and these are reductionist deterministic chemical reactions one man begged to differ with this idea influential it influenced francis crick and james watson the discoverers of the double helix structure of dna to paraphrase a description in the book he says at the molecular level living organisms have a certain order a structure to them that 's very different from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate matter where quantum effects play a very important role there 's something special about the structure the order inside a living cell so schrdinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics mechanics plays a role in life it and it didn 't really go very far but as i mentioned at the start in the last ten years there have been experiments emerging showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics i want to share with you just a few of the this is one of the the box on the left shows the which is not a little like a phantom leaping through to the other side you can see a faint smudge of light in the right hand box and yet somehow in the quantum world you don 't have to throw it over the we 're happy well happy is not the right word we are familiar with this it 's the reason our sun shines particles fuse together and the sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling back in the 70s and 80s it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells enzymes those workhorses of of life the catalysts of chemical reactions enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in in living cells by many many orders of magnitude and it 's always been a mystery how they do this well it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of is by transferring subatomic particles like electrons and indeed protons from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling it klinman other groups in the uk have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this research carried out by my group so so as i mentioned i 'm a nuclear physicist but i 've realized i 've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in in atomic nuclei one question we asked is again this is not a new idea it goes all the way back to the early 60s the two strands of dna the double helix structure are held together by rungs it 's like a twisted ladder and those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds what they 're doing is holding these large molecules nucleotides together zoom in a bit more so this a computer simulation and you can see that it 's a double hydrogen bond one prefers to sit on one side the other on the other side of the two strands of the two strands of the vertical lines going down which you can 't see if the two strands of dna then separate leading to the process of replication and the two protons are in the wrong this has been known for half a century the question is how likely are they to do that and if they do or can they quantum tunnel across even if they don 't have enough energy early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here we still don 't know yet how important it is this is still an open question surely this must have big implications to understand certain types of mutations possibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous another example of quantum mechanics in biology is is quantum coherence in one of the most important processes in and using that energy to create biomass it 's an object that behaves like a wave so that it doesn 't just move in one direction or the other but can follow multiple pathways at the same time some years ago the world of science was shocked when a paper was published the idea is that the photon the particle of light and yet evidence is growing almost weekly with new papers coming out confirming that this does indeed take place my third and final example is the most beautiful wonderful idea it 's also still very speculative but i have to share it with you the european robin migrates from scandinavia down to the mediterranean every autumn they navigate by sensing the earth 's magnetic field the earth 's magnetic field is very very weak it 's one hundred times weaker than than a fridge magnet and yet it affects wolfgang and in the 1970s confirmed that indeed the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the earth 's magnetic field to give it directional the only theory in town we don 't know if it 's the correct theory but the only theory in town is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement inside the robin 's retina i kid you not inside the robin 's retina is a protein called and yet somehow remain in contact with each other even einstein hated this idea he called it spooky action at a distance so if einstein doesn 't like it then we can all be uncomfortable with it we don 't know if it 's the correct explanation but it 's still speculative but i believe it 's built on solid science i also think that in the coming decade or so we 're going to start to see that actually it pervades life that watch this space"
