  "transcript": "see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces i very peculiar background attitude and to the real world because i am a conjurer now i prefer that term over magician because if i were a magician that would mean that i use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic no i don 't do that i 'm a conjurer who is someone who pretends to be a real magician how do we go about that sort of thing we depend on the fact that audiences such as yourselves will make assumptions for example when i walked up here and i took the microphone from the stand and switched it on you assumed this was a microphone which it is not as a matter of fact this is something that about half of you more than half of you will not be familiar with it 's a makes a very bad microphone i 've tried it many times the other assumption that you made and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions not only that you can but that you will when they are properly suggested to you but i can 't see you because i normally wear glasses these are not glasses these are empty frames quite empty frames now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face don 't you ever forget that now i have to do something first of all switch to real glasses so i can actually see you which would probably be a convenience i don 't know i haven 't had a good look well that great a convenience but i 'm going to take some medication this is ignore the instructions that 's what the government has to put in there a moment i must tell you that i am an actor i 'm an actor who plays a specific part i play the part of a magician wizard if you will a real wizard if someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of denmark named hamlet you would be insulted and rightly so why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you oh they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods oh they claim to be psychics or sensitives whatever they can thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead now to my innocent mind dead implies incapable of communicating they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead but they can hear the dead as well and they can relay this information back to the living i don 't think so because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do exactly the same the same physical methods the same psychological methods and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people i have two questions i would like to ask these people if i had the opportunity to do first question if i want to ask them to call up because they do hear them through the ear they listen to the spirits like this i 'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because when she died she had the family will and she secreted it someplace we don 't know where it is so we ask granny where is the will and i love you always be with you good bye where is the will we paid a lot of money for that information be we didn 't get it the second question that i 'd like to ask rather simple why do they insist on saying remember they speak into this ear why do they say my name starts with j or m is this a hunting game hunting and fishing what is it is it twenty questions no it 's more like one hundred and the needy people out there now this is a process that is called cold reading van praagh is his name james van praagh he 's one of the but in this country james that 's what dying is all about you stop breathing and then you 're dead i don 't think so now these people will make guesses they 'll say things like why am i getting electricity it was a game of hunting questions like this this is what they go through now it may bring a certain amount of comfort and what did she say to me ' i love sylvia browne is the big operator we call her the talons browne just to show you and you have to wait up to two years because she and then she we all know who he is on television he he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he doesn 't give a damn he just doesn 't care and he will expose her to television publicity all the time now what does sylvia browne without that how could we possibly function she gives you the names of previous lives who you were in previous lives duh it turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all babylonian nothing is ever said about you see these folks on television they never call anybody back from hell you see the story sylvia browne is an exception an exception in one way because the james randi educational foundation my foundation offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds very simply won all you have to do is prove any paranormal occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions 's very easy win the million dollars sylvia browne is an exception in that she 's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge and we haven 't heard from her since she said that first of all that she didn 't know how to contact me duh a professional psychic who speaks to dead people she can 't reach me i 'm alive you may have noticed she couldn 't reach me now she says she doesn 't want to reach me because i 'm a godless person all the more reason to take the million dollars wouldn 't you think sylvia now these people need to be stopped they 're ruined financially and emotionally because they 've given their money and their faith to these people let 's find out what that 's all about it 's an alternative form of healing right homeopathy actually consists and that 's what this is this is calms forte thirty two caplets of sleeping pills i forgot to tell you that i just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills six and a half days that certainly is a fatal dose it says right on the back i don 't really need it because i 've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world why don 't they affect me it 's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond avogadro 's limit diluting it down to the point where there 's none of it left it 's exactly equivalent to taking one and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous it is gone laughter that is what homeopathy is all about and another claim that they make you 'll love this one the more dilute the medicine is they say more powerful it is he forgot to take his pill work on it work on it i don 't know what we 're doing believing in all this nonsense over all these years let me tell you the james randi educational foundation they might some place out there maybe these people are just independently wealthy well with sylvia seven hundred dollars for a twenty minute reading over the telephone that 's more than lawyers make but wouldn 't you think they 'd like to take it just to make me look silly i think that something needs to be done about we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal state and local authorities to get them to do something we 've seen people even today speaking to us about aids epidemics and and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with those are very important but at the same time and it all lies in education it 's the media who are to blame for that 's what they 're looking at it 's go in there and look at the archives and you will begin to understand much more of what i 've been talking yes there could be a rotting of the american mind and of we 're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it oh we get lots of them hundreds of them every year come by they don 't know how to evaluate their own except in that case of sylvia browne ladies and gentlemen and i 'm waiting"
