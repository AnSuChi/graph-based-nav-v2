  "transcript": "i want to introduce you to an amazing woman her name is emigrated to the us at the age of eighteen and now lives just outside of washington nor a lobbyist she 'd probably tell you she 's quite unremarkable but she 's having the most remarkable impact what 's incredible about davinia is that she 's willing to spend time every single week focused on people who are not her nor even in her country people she 'd likely never meet and asked them to donate their pennies so she could fund girls ' education but seven hundred thousand pennies later she 's now sent over one hundred and twenty girls to school when we spoke last week she told me she 's become a little infamous at the local bank every time she rocks up with a shopping cart and there 's a name for people like davinia global citizens a global citizen is someone who and someone who is prepared to our world 's greatest challenges supporting and activating global citizens they exist in every country and among every demographic i 'm convinced that if we had more global citizens active in our world then every single one of the major challenges we face from poverty and they can ultimately only be solved by global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders now some people 's immediate reaction to this idea is that it 's either a bit utopian how i ended up here how it connects with davinia and hopefully with you i was one of those seriously irritating little kids that never ever stopped asking why you might have been one yourself i used to ask my mum the most annoying questions i 'd ask her questions like mum why i can 't i dress up and play with puppets all day why laughter the worst haircut and when i was twelve and in my first year of high school i started raising money for communities in the developing world we were a really enthusiastic group of kids and we raised more money than any other school in australia and so i was awarded the chance to go to the philippines to learn more it was there i became friends with sonny boy who lived on what was literally a pile of steaming garbage called it but don 't let the romance of that name fool you because it was nothing more than a rancid landfill that kids like sonny boy spent hours rummaging through every single day to find something anything of value that night with sonny boy and his family changed my life forever because when it came time to go to sleep we simply laid down on this concrete slab the size of half my bedroom with myself sonny boy and the rest of his family seven of us in this long line with the smell of rubbish all around us and cockroaches crawling all around and i didn 't sleep a wink but i lay awake thinking to myself why should anyone have to live like this when i have so much why should sonny boy 's ability to live out his dreams be determined by where he 's born or what warren buffett now i only later came to understand that the poverty i 'd seen in the philippines was the result of decisions made or not made by a succession of colonial powers and corrupt governments who had anything but the interests of sonny boy at heart sure they didn 't create smoky mountain but they may as it wouldn 't work just to try to send him a few dollars or to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived i came to see that community development should be driven by communities and that although charity is necessary it 's not sufficient and the best thing i could do is try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home to insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change i joined with a group of college friends in bringing the make poverty history campaign the edge and pearl jam who all agreed to headline i got a little bit excited that day as you can see but to our amazement the australian government heard our it felt like it felt like this incredible validation by rallying citizens together we helped persuade see there was a change in government and six years later all that new money disappeared what did we learn we learned that one off spikes are not enough we needed a sustainable movement not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician or the hint of an economic we asked ourselves how do we gain enough pressure and build a broad enough army to win these fights for the long term we could only think of one way we needed to somehow turn that short term excitement of involved with the make poverty history campaign into long term passion it had to be part of their identity but this is not about any one organization this is about citizens taking action and research data tells us that of the total population who even care about global issues so we had to somehow recruit and activate millions of citizens in dozens of countries to put pressure on their leaders to behave altruistically and we did so we discovered something really thrilling we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with people who are passionate about targeting all these interrelated we made sure that these festivals coincided with the un general assembly meeting so that leaders who need to hear our voices couldn 't possible ignore them but there was a twist you couldn 't buy a ticket you had to earn it i had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel good thing for me citizenship means you and amazingly it worked and last year we signed up more than one hundred thousand new members each and every week of the whole year and this is where i believe we can learn a lot from davinia who started taking action as a global citizen back in two thousand and twelve it wasn 't rocket science she started writing letters emailing politicians ' offices she volunteered her time in her local community that 's when she got active on social media and started to collect pennies a lot of pennies now maybe that doesn 't sound like a lot to you how will that achieve anything alongside one hundred making that announcement see when thousands of global citizens find inspiration from each other it 's amazing to see their collective power modi of india affirmed his commitment to put a toilet in every household and school across india by two thousand and nineteen global citizens encouraged by the late night host stephen colbert erna solberg the country 's prime minister got the message committing to double global citizens together with rotarians called on the canadian uk and australian governments to boost their investment into polio eradication but despite all of this momentum see you might be thinking to yourself how can we possibly persuade world leaders to sustain a focus on global issues the powerful american politician tip o 'neill once said all politics is local that 's what always got politicians elected to seek gain and hold onto power through the pursuit of local or at very best national interests i experienced this for the first and behind closed doors i shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty i said minister australia has this looked down on me with cold dismissive eyes and he said hugh no one gives a funk about foreign aid except he didn 't use the word funk he went on he said we need to look after our own backyard first parochialism offers this false dichotomy because it pits the poor in one country political leaders ought to give a funk because the impact of climate change and extreme poverty comes right to our shore now global citizens they understand this we live in a time that favors the global citizen in an age where every single voice can be heard see do you remember when the millennium development goals were signed back in the year two thousand the most we could do in those days was fire off a letter and wait for the next election billions of citizens have more more tools more access to information more capacity to influence than ever before both the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us and those of us who look beyond our borders are on the right side of history so where are we but have we achieved our mission the concept of global citizenship self evident in its logic has coincided with this particular moment in which we are privileged to live we as global citizens now have a unique opportunity global citizens will partner with the world 's leading ngos to end diseases like polio and malaria global citizens will sign up in every corner of this globe quality and impact of their actions these dreams are within reach imagine an army of millions engaged and unwilling to take no for an answer sadly i 've been unable to we met long before social media and his address has now been relocated by the authorities as often happens with slums i 'd love to sit down with him wherever he is and share with him how much the time i thanks to him and so many others i came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people and embrace the amazing possibilities of the world we share"
