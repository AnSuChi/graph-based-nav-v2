  "transcript": "debate is over the proposition what the world needs now is nuclear energy i 'd like to actually take a show of hands okay i 'm reading that at about in favor at the start which means we 're going to take a vote at the end and see see how that shifts if at all so here 's the format they 're going to have six minutes each and then after one little quick exchange between them i want two people on each side of this debate in the audience to have thirty seconds to make one short crisp pungent powerful point so in favor of the proposition possibly shockingly is one of truly the founders of the environmental movement the founder of the whole earth catalog someone we all know and love stewart brand those who know the most those who know the most are the least worried a classic example is james hansen a nasa climatologist pushing for three hundred and fifty parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere he came out with a wonderful book recently called storms of my grandchildren as are most climatologists who are engaging this is the design situation a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban look at the client base for this five out of six of us live in the developing world and in the cities and in the countryside electricity for cities at its best is what 's called and so far there are only three major sources of that scalable energy [ solar ] and wind and the other renewables aren 't there yet because they 're inconstant nuclear is and has been for forty years if all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear the waste from that lifetime of electricity would go in a coke can a pretty heavy coke can about two pounds but one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal then what happens to the waste the nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don 't have underground storage yet it 's just as well because it can stay where it is while the carbon dioxide vast quantities of it so when you add up the greenhouse gases in the lifetime of these various energy sources nuclear is down there with wind and hydro below solar and way below all the fossil fuels wind is wonderful i love wind i love being around these and so it takes a very large footprint on the land a very large footprint in terms of materials five to ten times what you 'd use for nuclear and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity is on the order of two hundred and fifty square miles of wind farm in places like denmark and germany they 've maxed out on wind already they 've run out of good sites the power lines especially here in california we 're discovering that the eighty solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze one thousand square miles of southern california desert well when you add all these things up saul griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get thirteen clean terawatts of energy and that area would be roughly the size of the united states an area he refers to as renewistan a guy who 's added it up all this very well is david mackay a physicist in england and in his wonderful we haven 't even started i think of most interest to a ted audience would be the new generation of reactors that are very small they 're referred to as nuclear batteries they 're incredibly safe weapons babcock & wilcox that make nuclear reactors here 's an integral fast reactor thorium reactor that nathan myhrvold 's involved in the governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive and these will go been at the nitty gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years in two thousand he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming after co2 his team have been making detailed calculations his first time at ted possibly a disadvantage we shall see from stanford professor mark jacobson good luck mark jacobson thank you so my premise here is that nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide puts out more air pollutants enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up than real renewable energy systems namely wind solar so let 's start just by looking at the co2 emissions from the life cycle co2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted and if you look wind and concentrated solar have the lowest co2 emissions if you look at the graph nuclear there are two bars here one is a low estimate and one is a high estimate the low estimate is the nuclear and then four to nine years for actual construction and in china right now they 're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear and the average just for the construction time of these is seven point one years you have to run the regular electric and the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid csp same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics you can see a separation that to battery electric vehicles hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on right now in the united states fifty to one hundred thousand people die per year from air pollution and vehicles are about twenty five thousand of those in two thousand and twenty the number will go down to fifteen thousand if you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol you 'd actually increase the death rate slightly you do get a big reduction but it 's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation north korea did that to some extent and venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb created that was used to destroy a city such as mumbai or or some other big city megacity the additional death rates due to this averaged over thirty years and then scaled to the population of the u s would be this so do we need this that because the footprint and you can power the entire u s vehicle fleet with seventy three thousand to one hundred and the spacing is something else that 's the footprint that range land or open space over the ocean and you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with now lots is worse than nuclear or wind for example cellulosic ethanol to power the entire u s vehicle this is how much land you would need that 's cellulosic second generation biofuels from prairie grass here 's corn ethanol it 's smaller this is based on there 's a larger area but much smaller footprint and now if you go back to looking at geothermal it 's even smaller but it 's still pretty small and this is to power the entire u s vehicle fleet to power the entire world with fifty percent base load is actually irrelevant we want to match the hour by hour and it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour by hour power demand here are the world wind resources there 's five to ten times more wind available worldwide than this is the choice blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power all right so while they 're having their comebacks on each other and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran i need two people from either side put up two hands if you 're against put up one and i want two of each for the mics now then you guys have you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said challenge it whatever sb i think a point of difference we 're having mark and these diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases a lot of those studies include well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we 'll have cities burning and stuff like that which is kind of finessing it a little bit i think the reality is that there 's what twenty one nations that have there are two nations north korea and israel that have nuclear weapons and don 't have nuclear power at all north america all of which have sorted out their situation in relation to nuclear weapons so that leaves a couple of places like iran maybe venezuela venezuela that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff once we know all that so the other thing is solving the world 's problems can be done if you really put your mind to it and use clean renewable when i joined the board of environmental defense fund that was one of the crafters of the kyoto protocol i 've come around in the last ten years i used to be against nuclear power i 'm now supporting stewart 's position softly from a agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of and that is we face a situation where it 's carbon carbon caps on this planet against david fanton hi i 'm david fanton i just want to say a couple quick things the first is be aware of the propaganda the propaganda from the industry has been very very we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions be very aware of the propaganda secondly think about this if we build all these nuclear power plants all that waste is going to be on hundreds if not thousands of trucks and trains moving through this country every day tell me that those accidents aren 't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years and then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn 't a potential terrorist target there 's a basic arithmetic problem here the capability of the sun shining the wind blowing so if we want to keep the lights on we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the i campaigned against nuclear weapons in the ' 80s and i continue to do so now but we 've got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time and ultimately the arithmetic problem isn 't going to go away we 're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone we need a solution that generates all of the time if we 're going to keep the lights on last person who was in favor made the premise that we don 't have enough alternative renewable resources and our against proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do and so the fallacy that we need this resource and and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is is not possible i will also add one other thing ray kurzweil and all the other talks we know that the the stick is going up exponentially it will blow you away what we 'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible disastrous nuclear power ca point well made thank you so each of you has really just a couple sentences thirty seconds each it all balances out chart that you had there it was a sunny day and a windy night and just now in england none of those things were stirring this keeps happening i used to worry about the ten thousand year factor and the fact is we 're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along and especially the small reactors need to go forward i heard from nathan myhrvold and i think here 's the action point it 'll take an act of congress to make the nuclear regulatory commission start moving quickly on these small reactors which we need very much here and in the world we 've analyzed the now with regard to the resources we 've developed the first wind map of the world from data alone at eighty meters we know what the wind resources are you can cover fifteen percent fifteen percent of the entire u s has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost competitive and there 's much more solar than there is wind there 's plenty of resource you can make it reliable people of the ted community i put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy all those in favor raise your hands now that is my take on that just put up hands up people who changed their minds during the debate who voted differently those of you who changed your mind in favor of for put your hands up okay so here 's here 's the read on it both people won mood of the ted community shifted from about to about sixty five to in favor you both won i congratulate both of you"
