  "transcript": "a linguist said that of the six thousand languages spoken on earth three thousand aren 't spoken by the children so that in one generation we 're going to halve our cultural diversity he went on to say that every two weeks an elder goes to the grave carrying the last spoken word of that culture so an entire philosophy a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically and this happens every two weeks so for the last twenty years since my dental experience i have been traveling the world and coming back with stories about some of these people this is tamdin she is a nun she was thrown in prison in tibet for two years for putting up a little tiny placard protesting the occupation of her country and when i met her she had just across to india thirty days and there 's a lot of snow at eighteen thousand five hundred feet in march his whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising when the dalai lama had to leave and he was beaten starved and it really impressed me i met him two weeks after he got out of prison so i was in dharamsala meeting these people and i was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of tibet into dharamsala and it just so happened on the fifth week there was a public teaching by the dalai lama and they gave us a little fm radio and we could listen to the translation of his teachings and what he said was treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels because it 's your enemies that build your tolerance and patience on the road to your enlightenment telling these people that had been through this two months later i went into so i snuck in a bunch of little and i would hand them out and when i gave them to the people and this is so i was going in interviewing these people and doing their portraits and i usually hand out polaroids when i do these because i 'm setting up lights and checking my lights he was found to be the buddha of compassion at the age of two out in a peasant 's way out in the middle of nowhere at the age of four he was installed as the dalai lama as a teenager he faced when they discovered there was a plot to kill him they dressed him up like a beggar and snuck him out of the country on horseback and took the same trip that tamdin did and he 's never been back to his country since and he still is holding this line so this is our icon to and this area of the ecuadorian amazon and in this period of time since that time as much oil or twice as much oil as was spilled in the exxon valdez accident was spilled in this little area of the amazon and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move and moi belongs to the huaorani tribe and they 're known as very and we spent i was with a team and the knowledge that these people have about the natural environment is incredible they could hear things smell things see things i couldn 't see and i couldn 't even see the monkeys that they were this is yadira and yadira is five years old she 's in a tribe that 's neighboring the huaorani and her tribe has had to move three times in the and we never hear about that and the latest infraction against these people is as part of plan colombia we 're spraying paraquat or round up whatever it is we 're defoliating thousands of acres of the ecuadorian amazon in our war on drugs and these people are the people who take the brunt of it and he said he said to us you know i 'm an older man now i 'm getting tired you know and i was i usually travel alone when i do my work but i did this and when i went down with the team i was deep into the huaorani tribe and as it turned out these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in one of the things i did just before nine eleven august of two thousand and one dax who was sixteen at the time but i wanted him to see people that live on a dollar a day or less i wanted him to get an experience in the islamic world and i also wanted him to i was going there to work with a group do a story on a group called the kalash that are a group of animists three thousand animists that live very small area surrounded by islam there 's three thousand of these and he brought a soccer ball and we had soccer every night in this little village and then we went up and met their shaman and this is john doolikahn who 's the shaman of the and he 's up in the mountains right on the border with afghanistan in fact on that other side is the area tora bora the area where and we watched and stayed with and the shaman i did a whole series on shamanism which is but around the world they go into trance in different ways and in pakistan and they 're all praying to the mountain gods as they getting kids used to different realities i think is so important what dan dennett said the other day having a curriculum where they study different religions just to make a mental flexibility give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems i think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place and all the security issues they they cause us so one thing we did five years ago we started a program that links kids in indigenous communities with kids in the united states so we first hooked up a spot in the navajo nation with a classroom in seattle he lives in this log cabin no running this is and the way we 've done this we teach digital storytelling to these kids and we have them tell stories about issues in their community that they care about and this is in peru where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up and the way we do it is we do it in workshops and we bring people who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling and have them work with the kids and just this last year we 've taken a group of teenagers in and this has worked the best so our dream is to bring teenagers together community service experience as well as this is teaching photoshop in the tibetan children 's village in dharamsala this is all their movies we 've got about sixty movies that these kids have made and 're quite incredible the one i want to show you after we get them to make the movies we have a night where we show the movies to the community and this is in takaungu we 've got a generator and a digital projector and we 're projecting it up against a barn and showing one of the movies that they made the other thing i wanted to give indigenous people national geographic just did a roper study of eighteen to twenty six year olds in our country and in nine other industrialized countries it was a two million dollar study united states came in second to last in geographic knowledge seventy percent of the kids couldn 't find afghanistan or iraq on a map and this is a study that was just done a couple of years i 'd like to show you now in the couple of minutes i have left is a film that a student made in guatemala we just had a workshop in guatemala a week before we got to the workshop a massive landslide caused by hurricane stan last october came in and buried six hundred people alive and this kid lived in the village he wasn 't there at the time and this is the little movie he put together about we can play it this is an old mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather"
