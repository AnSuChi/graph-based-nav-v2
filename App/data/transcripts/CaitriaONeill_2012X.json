  "transcript": "that was me in front of our house in monson massachusetts last after an ef3 tornado ripped straight through our town and took parts of our roof off i decided to stay in massachusetts instead of pursuing the master 's program i had moved my boxes home that afternoon for morgan o 'neill we started faking it this experience changed our lives and now we 're trying to change tornadoes don 't happen in massachusetts after a lamppost flew by my family and i sprinted into the basement transformers were burning in the street mo actually it gets weirder i was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit playing with the tornado display and start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area we live across the street from a historic church that had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm it had become a community gathering place overnight the town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits and so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church co we found problems there were a couple large sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church but nobody knew where to send them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet as we watched they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own mo we built a recovery machine co we should inventory the donations co and we need a hotline can you make a google voice number mo sure and we need to tell people what not to bring i 'll make a facebook hey there 's a news truck i 'll tell them co you got my number off the news we don 't need more freezers donate three water heaters but someone needs to come pick them up co my car is in my living room mo my boyscout troop would like to rebuild twelve mailboxes co my puppy is missing and insurance doesn 't cover chimneys mo my church group of fifty would like housing and meals for a week while we repair properties and now i 'm covered in poison ivy to solve problems in a minute or less otherwise something more urgent would come up and it wouldn 't get done mo we didn 't get our authority from the board of selectmen or the emergency management director or the united way we just started answering questions and making decisions because someone anyone had to i 'm good at facebook and the point is if there 's a flood or a fire or a hurricane you or somebody like you are going to step up and start organizing things the other point is that it is hard mo lying on the ground after another 17 hour day caitria and i would empty our pockets and try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context all bits of information that had to be remembered and matched in order to help someone after another day and a shower at the shelter we realized it shouldn 't be this hard co in a country like ours where we breathe wi fi leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no brainer systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time and if some community member is in this organizing position in every area after every disaster these tools should exist mo i decided to stay in the country give up the master 's in moscow and to work full time to make this happen in the course of the past year we 've become experts in the field of community powered disaster recovery and there are three main problems that we 've observed with the way things work currently mo but they often fulfill very specific missions and then they leave this leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers thousands of donations and all with no training and no tools so they use post its or excel or facebook but none of these tools allow you to value high priority information amidst all of the photos and well wishes co the timing disaster relief is essentially a backwards a political campaign you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action you build both gradually until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election in a disaster however you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity and you 've only got about seven days to capture fifty percent of all of the web searches that will ever be made to help your area then some sporting event happens and you 've got only the resources that you 've collected thus far to meet the next five years of recovery needs this is the slide for katrina and you 've only got about four days of interest in dallas mo data is inherently unsexy but it can but if the town can mobilize now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get when you 've just sent out two thousand volunteers and you can 't prove it co these are three problems with a common solution if we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together we can create new standards in disaster recovery mo remote volunteer access all in an and we 've been flying into disaster areas since this past january setting up software training residents and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters mo one of our first launches was after the dallas tornadoes this past we flew into a town that had a static outdated website and a frenetic facebook feed trying to structure the response and we launched our platform but by the time they lost the news cycle that 's when the needs came in yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give and they 've been able to meet the needs of their residents co so it 's working but it could be better emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place so that 's what we 're working on we 're working on getting the software to places so people expect it so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that that drives recovery mo it 's not rocket science these tools are obvious and people want them in our hometown we trained a half dozen residents to run these web tools on their own because caitria and i live here in boston they took to it immediately of nature there are over three volunteer groups working almost every day and have been since june one of last year to make sure these residents get what they need and get back in their homes they have hotlines and spreadsheets and data co and that makes a difference june one this year marked the one year anniversary of the monson tornado and our community 's never been more connected or more empowered we 've been able to see the same transformation in texas and in alabama because it doesn 't take harvard or mit to fly in and fix problems after a disaster it takes a local no but if you give locals the tools"
