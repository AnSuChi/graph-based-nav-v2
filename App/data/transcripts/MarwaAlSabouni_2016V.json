  "transcript": "six years of war homs is now a half destroyed city my family and i were lucky our place is still my husband and i used to run an architecture studio in the old town main the merchants who had stalls in the old city market now trade out of sheds on the streets under our apartment all sorts of jobs to get by when i look at my destroyed city of course i ask myself what has led to this senseless war syria was largely a place of tolerance historically accustomed how did my country a country with communities living harmoniously together and comfortable in discussing their differences displacement there were many reasons that had led to the war social political and economic there is one key reason that has been overlooked important to analyze because from it will largely depend whether we can make sure that this doesn 't happen again and that reason is architecture architecture in warring factions and this is probably true for other key role in whether a community crumbles or comes together syrian society has long lived the coexistence of different traditions and backgrounds syrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade they have enjoyed the true meaning back to back in the interwoven souks and public venues and the proportions and sizes based on principles of humanity and harmony this architecture of mixity integrating with it and embracing its spirit so did its communities people lived and worked with each other in a place that gave them a sense of belonging and made them feel at home they shared a remarkably unified existence but over the gradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with first by the urban planners of the colonial period when the french went enthusiastically about transforming what they saw as the un modern syrian cities they blew up city urbanism and architecture of our cities assured identity and belonging not by and the new coveted the harmony of the built environment and social environment got trampled over by and the same was happening to the community as the shape of the built environment changed so the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities also started changing and communities started drifting apart from the while many reasons had led to the syrian war we areas without proper infrastructure made of endless rows of bare block boxes containing people that used to bind the city together whether they were social through me an aside when i read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world i recognize the beginning of the kind of instability we have witnessed so disastrously here in syria we have severely destroyed cities i have to ask is what are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes the main focus should be on creating places that make need to recapture some of the traditional values that did just that creating the conditions for coexistence and peace values of beauty that don 't exhibit ostentation but rather mixed designs that encourage a sense of community there is a neighborhood here in homs that 's called baba amr that has been fully destroyed almost two years ago i introduced this design into a un habitat competition for rebuilding it echoing parking and playing and leisure trees and shaded areas it obviously i drew it during the few hours of electricity we get and there are many possible ways to express belonging and community through architecture disconnected the coherent urbanism of the old islamic city while rows of soulless housing or tower blocks even when they are luxurious tend to promote isolation and otherness even simple things like shaded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city can make a difference in how people feel towards the place and whether they consider it a generous place that gives a place in order for a place to give its architecture should be giving too and whether in the shape of informal concrete slums or broken social housing or trampled old towns the contemporary urban archetypes that have emerged all across the middle east have been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities we can learn from this we can learn how to rebuild in another way how to create an architecture that doesn 't contribute only to the practical and economic aspects of people 's lives but also to their social spiritual we need to create again cities that are shared by the communities that inhabit them because they will all feel at home"
