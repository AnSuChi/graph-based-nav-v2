  "transcript": "going to ask you three multiple choice questions use this device use this device to answer the first question is how did the number of deaths per year from natural please please answer and we go to the next question did it remain more or less the same or did it halve now answers you see deaths from natural disasters in the world you can see it from this graph here from one thousand nine hundred to two thousand in one thousand nine hundred there was about half a million people who died every year from natural this is how they answered fifty percent thought it had doubled thirty eight percent said it 's more or less the same twelve said it had halved this is the best data from the disaster researchers and and it goes to to the second world war that it starts to fall and it keeps falling and it 's down to much less than half the world has been much much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this you know so i went to the zoo and i asked the chimps so the chimps that 's you you were beaten but that 's not enough you shouldn 't compare yourself to swedes you must have let 's look at the next answer here women in school and that gives you a hint right answer is probably the one the fewest swedes picked that everyone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties they are stopped when they go to school but in the majority of the where most people in the world live most countries girls today go to school as long as boys more or less that doesn 't mean that gender equity is achieved not at all they still but schooling is there in the world today now we miss the majority when you answer you answer according to the and you ah you almost made it to the chimps of course they think so because they don 't even know what has happened the first thing to think about the future is to know about the present these questions were and ola rosling he 's cofounder and director and he wanted ola told me we have to be more systematic when we fight devastating ignorance so already the pilots reveal this this is how it was in one thousand nine it 's the number of people on each income from one dollar a day see and then there was one hump here somewhere between ten and one hundred dollars the world was two groups it was a camel world like a camel with two humps and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world with one hump only but that can be ended now is to get away from that understand where the majority is and that is very clearly shown we asked what is the percentage of the world 's one year old children who have got those basic vaccines against measles and other things that we have had for many years this is what the u s public and the swedish answered look at the swedish result you know what the right answer is who the heck is a professor of global health in that country and i think there were about two and this was one of the comments i bet no member of the media passed the test give it to them and measure what the media know and ladies and gentlemen and then lately from the european union media you see the problem is not that people don 't read and the problem is that the media doesn 't know themselves what shall we do about fortunately i will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault actually then but first let 's look at why are we so ignorant and it all starts in this place it 's a neighborhood where i grew up actually it has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods we have all different experiences from communities and people we meet well i like schools but teachers tend to because they learned something when they went to school and now they describe this world to the students without any bad and there is really no practice to keep the teaching material up to date so that 's what we are focusing on so we have these outdated facts added on top of our personal bias what happens next is news okay an excellent journalist knows how to pick the story that will make headlines and people will read it because it 's sensational unusual events are more interesting no and they are exaggerated and especially things we 're afraid of a shark attack on a swedish person will get headlines for weeks in sweden so these three skewed sources of information were really hard to get away from they kind of bombard us and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas and on top of it we put the very thing that makes us humans it was good in evolution it helped us generalize and jump to conclusions very very fast it helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of and we seek causality where there we then get an illusion above the average everybody answered that question yeah i drive cars better this was good evolutionarily but now when it comes to the worldview it is the exact reason why it 's upside down the trends that are increasing are instead falling and the other way around and in this wasn 't it so by measuring it we can understand what is the pattern of ignorance we started the pilot last year and now we 're pretty sure that we will encounter a lot of ignorance across the whole world and the idea is really to scale it up to all domains or dimensions of global finance all different sectors have facts so i and asking them what are your favorite facts which you think the public doesn which you can use if you 're a large organization a school a university or maybe a news agency to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable basically meaning we don 't hire people who score like you will be sitting in an interview having to fill out this crazy so there is of course one way which is to sit down late nights and learn all the facts by heart by reading all these reports that will never so now i 'm going to show you some tricks where the misconceptions are turned around let 's start with the first misconception this is very widespread everything is don 't go for the worse that will help you score better on our tests if you feel unsure go now the next preconceived idea is so if you are unsure they 're only rules of thumb so of course they don 't apply to everything but i 'm very afraid of sharks so as soon as i see a question about things i 'm afraid of which might be earthquakes other religions maybe i 'm afraid of terrorists or sharks anything that makes me feel of course there are dangerous things that are also great that 's how you should think with these four they cannot generalize these kinds of okay that 's a systematic approach now the question is this important yeah it extreme poverty and how to to fight you might have a chance to understand what 's coming next in the future we 're going back to these two humps in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five that 's when i was born and i selected the west let 's now see how the rest and the west compares in terms of how rich you are these are the people who can afford to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five only thirty percent of them lived outside eu and north so first let 's look at the change up till today two thousand and fourteen so i can use that i did that but i went even further i used those five years for the next twenty in the rich consumer market these are just projections of gdp per capita into the future seventy three percent of the rich consumers are going to live outside north america and europe so yes i think it 's a good idea for a company to use this certificate to make sure to make fact based decisions in thank you very much"
