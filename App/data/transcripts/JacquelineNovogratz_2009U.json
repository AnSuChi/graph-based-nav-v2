  "transcript": "i 've been working on issues of poverty for more than twenty years and so it 's ironic that the problem that and question that i most grapple with is how you actually define poverty what does it mean so often we look at dollar terms people making less than a dollar or two or three a day and yet complexity of poverty really has to look at and i had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that i have it was in kenya and i want to share it with you i was with my friend susan meiselas the photographer in the mathare valley slums now mathare valley is one of the oldest slums in africa it 's about three miles out of nairobi and it 's a mile long and about two tenths of a mile wide and it 's known for prostitution violence drugs a hard place to grow and when we were walking through the narrow alleys it was literally impossible not to step in the but at the same time it was also impossible not to see the human vitality the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there women washing their babies washing their clothes hanging them out to dry i met this woman mama rose who has rented that little tin shack for thirty two and she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside it was also the day after the inauguration and i would see kids on the street corners and they 'd say obama he 's our brother and i 'd say well obama 's my brother so that makes you my brother too and they would look quizzically and then be high five she started off by telling me her dream she said i had two my first dream was to be a doctor and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my mother was a single mom and when she turned twenty found herself pregnant with a second child and so she ultimately turned to organized in the way we often think of it she would go into the city at night with about twenty girls and she said you know the poverty wasn 't so bad it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all in two thousand and one her life changed she had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization jamii bora that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were as long as you provided a commensurate amount in and so she spent a year to save fifty dollars and started borrowing and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine she started tailoring and she repurposes them with and ribbons and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women for their daughter 's sweet sixteen or first holy communion and she does really good business in fact i watched her walk through the streets hawking and before you knew it there was a crowd of women around her and i reflected as i was watching her sell the dresses and also the jewelry that she makes and so she can 't move out she lives with all of that insecurity and in fact in january during the ethnic riots she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack in which she would live jamii bora understands that and understands that and so with patient capital from acumen and other organizations loans and investments that will go the long term with them they built a housing development about an hour outside nairobi central insisting on responsibility and accountability so she has to give and in the next couple of weeks she 's going to be among the first two hundred families to move into this development when i asked her if she feared anything or whether she would miss anything from i 'm hiv positive i 've dealt with it all i said well what about your and i fiercely love my children and they love me back but what i really wanted to be was somebody who served and and if you are still alive you have to serve ' and she said i 'm not a doctor who gives out pills but maybe me i give out something better because i give them hope and in the middle of this economic where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear i think we 're well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out recognizing that being poor doesn 't mean being ordinary because when systems are broken like the ones that we 're seeing around the world it 's an opportunity for invention and for innovation it 's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings i truly believe it 's where dignity starts"
