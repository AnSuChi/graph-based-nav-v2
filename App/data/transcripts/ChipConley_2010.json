  "transcript": "talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century in the 21st century we need to actually look at and what i 'm actually going to encourage you to consider today is to go back to our school days let me start by telling you a little story this is van quach she came to this country in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six from vietnam she changed her name to vivian because she wanted to fit in here in america her first job was at an inner city motel in san francisco as a maid i happened to buy that motel about three months after vivian started working there so vivian working together for twenty three years with the youthful idealism of a 26 year old in one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven i started my company and i called it joie de vivre a very impractical name because i actually was looking to create joy of life and this first hotel that i bought motel was a in the inner city of san francisco as i spent time with vivian i saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work it so i spent time with vivian and i saw that she didn 't find joy in cleaning toilets her job her goal and her calling was not to become the world 's greatest toilet scrubber what counts for vivian was the emotional connection she created because vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home served me well during the last economic downturn we had in the wake of the dotcom crash and nine eleven san francisco bay area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of american hotels well not exactly of course not we started eating freedom fries well my name of my company joie de vivre i started getting these letters from places like alabama and orange county we 're based in san francisco and i 'd get a terse response oh that 's worse so but given my befuddled state of mind i ended up in the self help section very quickly that 's where i got reacquainted with abraham maslow 's hierarchy of needs but as i sat there for four hours the full afternoon reading maslow i recognized something that is true of most leaders and that is that we 're all human so as i started reading more maslow what i started to realize is that so i realized in that dotcom crash and that 's what i did a few years ago when i took that five level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what i call the transformation pyramid which is survival success and transformation it 's not just fundamental in business it 's fundamental in life and we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs these transformational needs for our key employees these three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five what kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees ' sense of meaning or our customers ' sense of emotional connection with us we actually started asking our employees do they understand the mission of our company what we found is we created more loyalty we tripled in size as i went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure so i went out and studied a bunch of things and i found a survey that showed that ninety four percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their but we don 't have a clue how to measure them so here 's another einstein quote not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can 't be counted or valued aren 't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane it was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my ceo hat off for a week and fly off to the himalayan peaks i flew off to a place that 's been shrouded in mystery for centuries a place some folks call the teenage king of bhutan was also a curious man but this was back in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away at age seventeen he started asking the kinds of questions that you 'd expect of someone with a beginner 's mind early in his reign as as king he was asked by an indian journalist about the bhutanese gdp the size of the bhutanese gdp gdp why don 't we care in essence the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success what has come to be known as gnh or gross national happiness most world leaders didn 't take notice and those that did thought this was just buddhist economics but the king was serious this was a notable moment because this was the first time a world leader in almost two hundred years had suggested that that intangible of happiness that that leader two hundred years ago thomas jefferson with the declaration of independence this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure and it 's something we should actually value as government officials for the next three three dozen years as king this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in bhutan including just recently taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy so as i spent time with leaders in the gnh movement i got to really understand what they 're doing and i got to spend some time with the prime minister over dinner i asked him an impertinent question how can you create and measure something which evaporates in other words happiness we create the conditions for happiness to occur in other words we create a habitat of happiness one of those key indicators is how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day it how do you feel about how you spend your time each day time is one of the scarcest resources and yet of course that little intangible piece of data doesn 't factor into our gdp calculations anybody one thousand nine hundred and fifty four he wrote a book called the real enjoyment and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want i think the bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have imagine gratitude divided by having what you want gratification the bhutanese aren 't on some aspirational treadmill constantly focused on what they don 't have their religion their isolation their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their gnh movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude gratitude about what they do have in the denominator do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out an object that we 're supposed to get or maybe many objects actually in fact if you look in the dictionary many dictionaries define pursuit as to chase with hostility do we pursue happiness with hostility but back to bhutan bhutan 's bordered on its north and south by thirty eight percent of the world 's population bhutan 's created the ultimate export a new global currency and there are forty countries around the world today that are studying their own gnh this last fall nicolas sarkozy in france announcing the results of an 18 month study by two nobel economists focusing on happiness and wellness in france what some french are just three days ago three days ago here at ted we had a simulcast of david cameron potentially the next prime minister of the uk quoting one of my favorite speeches of all time robert kennedy 's poetic speech from when he suggested that we 're myopically focused on the wrong thing and that gdp is a misplaced so it suggests that the momentum is shifting i 've taken that robert kennedy quote and i 've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here this is a collection of things that robert kennedy said in that quote as you look at these two columns it make you feel like it 's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count a new way to imagine what 's important to us in life certainly robert kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that he said gdp measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile so how do we do that let me say one thing we can just start doing but all of those questions are tangible they how many people you live with and whether you own your home or not that 's about it we 're not asking meaningful metrics we 're not asking important questions 's intangible he said if the only tool you have is a hammer everything starts to look like a nail excuse that expression we 've been fooled by our tool of the world 's gdp today is in that intangible industry we call service the service industry the industry i 'm in and only thirty six percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture so maybe it 's time that we get a bigger toolbox right maybe it 's time we get a toolbox that doesn 't just count what 's easily counted the tangible in life the things that are intangible i was also a curious economics major as an undergrad i learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same in fact as leaders what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling in vivian 's case her unit of production isn 't the tangible hours she works it 's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work this is dave arringdale who 's actually he tells me between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business we don 't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits we can have both in fact inspired employees quite often help make what really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people i learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country what can you start counting today thank you very much"
