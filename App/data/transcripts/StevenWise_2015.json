  "transcript": "i 'd like to have you look at this pencil and so are books you might have or the cars you own they too are i can do that to a legal thing i can do whatever i want to my book or my car these great apes you 'll see the photographs are taken by a man named james mollison who wrote a book called james & other apes and he tells in his book how they don 't have the capacity for legal they count in law and they 're the masters all human beings are legal persons being human and being a legal person has never been and is not today synonymous with humans and legal persons are not synonymous on the one side there have been women children were great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries has been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed but alas that hole has closed up but they 've never only been limited to human india a court held that a hindu idol was a legal person that a mosque was a legal person and in two thousand and twelve just i read peter singer 's book in one thousand nine hundred and eighty when i had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed i was moved by it because i had become a lawyer because i wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defenseless and i 'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the trillions of nonhuman animals are and i began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by one thousand nine hundred and eighty five i realized that i was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients all the animals whose interests i was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so i decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal now at that time there was very little known about or spoken about about truly animal rights about the idea of having legal personhood or legal rights for a and so in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five i figured that it would it would take about thirty years before we 'd be able to even begin a strategic litigation long term campaign in order to to be able to punch another hole through through that wall it turned out that i was pessimistic that what we had to do in order to to begin was not only to write law review articles and so one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was a legal cause of action and a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use to their arguments in front of courts it turns out whereby a black slave had used the legal system and had moved from a legal thing to a legal person i was so interested in it that i eventually wrote wrote an entire book about it and so one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of godparents because to and so in the fall of one thousand seven hundred and seventy one we don 't know exactly what happened but then james dropped out of sight an enraged charles stewart then hired slave catchers to canvass the city of london find him bring him not back to charles stewart but to a ship the ann and mary that was floating in and the ship was to set sail for jamaica where james was to be sold in the slave markets and be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had harvesting sugar cane in well now james godparents swung into action and they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus on behalf of james somerset and a writ of habeus corpus is called the great writ capital capital w and it 's meant to protect any of us who are detained against our will a writ of habeus corpus is issued the detainer is required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily bodily well lord mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because if james somerset was a legal thing he was not a writ of habeus corpus only if he could be a legal person and he issued the writ of habeus corpus and james 's body was brought in by the captain of the ship there were a series of hearings over the next six months on june twenty two one thousand seven hundred and seventy two lord mansfield said that slavery was so odious and he used the word odious that the common law would not support it and he ordered james free at that moment james somerset underwent a legal the free man who walked out of the courtroom looked exactly like the slave who had walked in but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common the next thing we did is that the nonhuman rights project which i founded then began to look at what kind of values and principles do we want to and a fundamental a fundamental liberty right protects a fundamental life saving medical treatment a judge will not order it forced upon you because they will respect your self determination and your autonomy now an equality right is the kind of right to which you 're entitled because you resemble someone else in a relevant way and there 's the rub relevant way so if you if you are that then because they have the right you 're like them you 're entitled but you have to at the bare minimum you must that line has to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end self determining being like you 're seeing behind me then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be we decided upon chimpanzees not just jane goodall was on our board of directors and so we chose chimpanzees and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition we found them in japan they wrote one hundred pages of affidavits in which they set out more than forty ways in which their complex cognitive these included for example especially alone it 's the thing that we do to our worst criminals and we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it have some kind of moral capacity when they play economic games with human beings they 'll spontaneously make fair offers even when they 're not required to do so they can engage in language or to stay out of the language wars they 're involved in intentional and referential communication in which they pay attention to the attitudes of those with whom they are speaking they have culture scientists in the in the ta forests in the ivory coast found chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open the incredibly hard hulls of nuts it takes a long time to learn how to do that and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture this way of doing it these rocks had passed down for at least four thousand three hundred years through two hundred and twenty five chimpanzee generations tommy was a chimpanzee we found we found him in a small room that was filled with cages we found them and so on the last week of december two thousand and thirteen the nonhuman rights project filed three suits all across the state of new york using the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument that had been used with james somerset and we demanded that the judges issue these common law writs of habeus corpus we wanted the chimpanzees and we wanted them brought to save the chimps a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in south florida which involves an artificial artificial lake and these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee with other we shall this is a long term strategic we shall and to quote but they are perhaps the end of the beginning"
