  "transcript": "i 'm here to show you how something you can 't see can be so much fun to look at you 're about to experience available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives what i have here is a cinder block and and you can see that it 's porous it absorbs water so what 's superhydrophobic superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface the rounder it is the more hydrophobic it is and if it 's really round it 's superhydrophobic a freshly waxed car the water molecules slump to about ninety degrees and we 've coated one of the gloves and let 's see if you can tell which one and i 'll give you a hint when you have nanotechnology and and nanoscience what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits and we and to put some scale to that but very useful and it 's not just water that this works with it 's a lot of moving onto the next demonstration we 've taken a pane of glass and we 've coated the outside of it we 've framed it with the nanotechnology coating and you 're going to see it 's going to spread out on glass like you 'd normally think it would except when it hits the coating it 's that afraid of the water the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface you 'd think it 'd be smooth but it 's actually not and it has and those spaces so if i put this inside this water here you can see a silver reflective and it 's dry so what are the applications i mean many of you right now are probably going through your head everyone that sees this gets excited and says oh i could use it for this and this and this it could be anything that 's it could be it could be and it could be things that need to be but before i do that i would like to say thank you and think small about us cutting out the design from ted"
