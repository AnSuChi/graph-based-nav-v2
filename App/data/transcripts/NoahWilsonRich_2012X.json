  "transcript": "this man is wearing what we call a bee beard a beard full of bees now this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees i understand that but so this really demonstrates our relationship with and that goes deep back for thousands of years we 're very co evolved because we depend on bees for pollination and even more recently as an economic commodity but they 're gone we don 't even find dead bodies this is called colony collapse disorder and it 's bizarre researchers around the globe still do not know know what 's causing it so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture we 're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood garden in the south end that 's where i call home i have a beehive in the backyard and perhaps a green roof in the future when we 're further utilizing urban areas where there are stacks of check out this image above the orange line in boston try to spot the beehive it 's there it 's on the rooftop right on the corner there and it 's been there for a couple and that 's why i want you today to try to think about this think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works so we know flowers we know fruits and vegetables even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat rely on and let 's think about urban living not today and not in the past but what about in a hundred years we have huge so we need to change the way that we see cities and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today you can see how gray and brown it is we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the we save on the costs of transportation we save and we also educate and create new jobs locally we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living here 's some data that we collected through our company with best bees where we deliver install and manage and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is so let 's look at the first metric here overwintering survival now this has been a huge problem for many years basically since the late overwintering success is hard and that 's when most of the colonies are lost and we found that in the cities bees are surviving better than they are in the country a bit counterintuitive right we think oh bees countryside they also produce more honey the urban honey is delicious the bees in boston on the rooftop of the seaport hotel where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that i 'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health we can go back to the year nine hundred and fifty and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in ireland so the problems of bees today isn 't necessarily something new so one thing i want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is you think in the city maybe the temperature 's warmer why are bees doing better in the city this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be perhaps there 's more pollen in the city with the trains coming in to urban hubs they can carry pollen with them very light pollen and it 's just a big supermarket in the city a lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks and colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees honeybees and it 's a huge huge grand challenge of our time and you can see at the top right the years are changing we 're coming up to modern times and you can see and that is when the game changed for for honeybees in the united states many of us will remember our childhood growing up maybe you got stung by a bee you saw bees on flowers think of the kids today so we need bees and they 're disappearing and it 's a big problem what can we do here so what i do is honeybee research i got my ph d studying honeybee health i started in two thousand and five studying honeybees in two thousand and six honeybees started disappearing so suddenly like this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs i 'm not one of the many researchers around the world who 's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees we 're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines through yogurt like probiotics and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees and this process is so easy even a 7 year old can do it we exercise we eat healthy we take vitamins why don 't we think about honeybees in that same type of way bring them to areas where they 're thriving i spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles like years years at the bench oh my gosh it 's three a m and i 'm still pricking that 's what we do i mean really open your mind with this you can hide a hive inside your home and they 're beautiful here i mean we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets and these bees are terrific and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden that 's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking and the honey they do live events they 'll use that honey at their bars honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there we also have a classroom hives project where this is a nonprofit venture we 're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting behind glass and used as an educational tool this hive that you see here has been in fenway high school for many years now the bees fly right into the outfield of fenway park nobody notices it if you 're other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban beekeeping terrific is in new york city beekeeping was illegal until two thousand and ten locally in we have also some images of honey from brooklyn now this was a mystery in the new york times where the honey was very red and the new york state forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping they 've had hives and we should do this and i 'll show you an ending note here"
