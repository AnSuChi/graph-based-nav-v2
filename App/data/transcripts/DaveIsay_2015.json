  "transcript": "i 'm going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you and in yours when i was twenty two years old i was lucky enough to find my calling when i fell into making radio stories at almost the exact same time i found out that my dad who i was very very close to and i was crushed at some point in one of our strained conversations my dad mentioned the stonewall riots told me that one night in a group of young black and latino drag queens fought back against the police at a gay bar in manhattan called the stonewall inn and how this sparked the modern gay rights movement so i decided to pick up my tape recorder and find out more with the help of a young archivist named michael shirker we tracked down all of the people we could find who had been at the stonewall inn that night i saw how the microphone gave me the license to go places i otherwise never would have gone and talk to people i might not otherwise ever have spoken to i had the privilege of getting to know some of the most amazing fierce and courageous human beings i had ever met and it changed my working to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media i 'd see how this simple act of being interviewed could mean so much to people particularly those who had been told that their stories didn 't matter i could literally see people 's back straighten as they started to speak into the microphone in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight i made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels on the bowery in manhattan guys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades they lived in cubicles the size of prison cells covered i remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book and showing one of the guys his page he stood there staring at it in silence then he grabbed the book out of my hand the thought was to take documentary work and turn it on its head broadcast documentary has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people but i wanted to try something where the interview itself was the purpose of this work and see if we could give many many many people the chance to be listened to in this way we built a booth where anyone can come to honor someone else by interviewing them about their you sit across from say your grandfather for close to an hour and you listen and you talk many people think of it as if this was to be our last conversation what would i want to ask of and say to this person who means so much to me you walk away with a copy of the interview and another copy goes to the folklife center at the library of congress so that your so we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world and invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation with another human being i had no idea if but from the very beginning it did people treated the experience with incredible respect and amazing conversations happened inside i want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original grand central booth this is 12 year old joshua littman interviewing his mother sarah josh has asperger 's syndrome as you may know kids with asperger 's are incredibly but have a tough time socially so this is josh talking with his mom sarah at grand central nine years ago josh littman do you think your life would be different without animals sarah littman i think it would be an eight without animals because they add so much pleasure to life jl how else do you think your life would be different i could do without things like cockroaches and snakes jl well i 'm okay with snakes as long as they 're not venomous or constrict you or anything sl yeah i 'm not a big snake person jl but cockroach is just the insect we love to hate sl yeah it really is jl have you ever thought you couldn 't cope with having a child you had really bad colic so you would just cry and cry jl what 's colic sl it 's when you get this stomach ache and you were pretty loud but amy 's was more high pitched jl but being friendly comes easily to amy whereas i think for you it 's more the important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends and really that 's what you need in life jl did i turn out to be the son you wanted when born did i meet your expectations sl you 've exceeded my expectations sweetie because sure you have these fantasies of what your child 's going to be like but because you think and it 's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person and i 'll always thank you for that jl and that helped when amy was born sl and that helped when amy was born but you are so incredibly special to me and i 'm so lucky to have you as my son sarah littman and her son josh who is now an honors student and it 's not because they 're sad most of them aren 't i think it 's because you 're hearing something authentic and pure at this moment when sometimes it 's hard to tell what 's real and what 's an advertisement it 's kind of the nobody comes to get famous it 's simply an act of generosity and love so this experiment in grand central worked and we expanded across the country it 's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered we 've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience most serve a year or two with storycorps traveling the and if you ask them all of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing they 've learned from being present during these interviews is that people are basically good and i think for the first years of storycorps you could argue that there was some kind of a selection bias happening but after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person in eighty different languages across the political spectrum you have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something i 've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen like this interview between a betting clerk in brooklyn named danny perasa who brought his wife annie to storycorps to talk about his love for her danny perasa you see the thing of it is it 's like you write a love letter to me every morning dp well the only thing that could possibly be wrong is i couldn 't find a silly pen ap to my princess the weather outside today is extremely rainy i 'll i love you there 's a shelter when you get home there 's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying get your hands off me being married is like having a color television set you never want to go back to black and white di danny was about five feet tall with crossed eyes and one single snaggletooth but danny perasa had more romance in his little pinky than all of hollywood 's leading men put together what else have i learned i 've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity for the human spirit to forgive i 've learned about resilience and i 've learned about strength israel and mary johnson when oshea was a teenager he murdered mary 's only son laramiun byrd in a gang fight and when he was finally released from the penitentiary oshea actually moved in next door to mary this is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had soon after oshea was freed mary johnson i 'll have the opportunity to see you graduate i hopefully one day i 'll be able to experience that with you it motivates me to you still believe in me and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain i caused you it 's amazing mj even with us sitting here looking at each other right now i know it 's not an easy thing i admire that you can do this oi i love you lady mj i love you too son and i 've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people and how the arc of history truly does bend towards justice who was born arthur martinez in the harold ickes projects in chicago in the interview she talks with her daughter lesley about joining a gang as a young man and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be this is alexis and her daughter lesley difficult things for me was i was always afraid that i wouldn 't be allowed to be in my granddaughters ' lives and you blew that completely out of the water you and your husband lesley martinez but they 're free to talk about have to tiptoe we 're not going to cut you off and that 's something i 've always wanted you to just know that you 're loved am but now i walk in love and i try to live that way every day now i walk in love i 'm going to tell you a secret about storycorps it takes some courage to have these conversations participants know this recording will be heard long after they 're gone who has worked closely with us on recording interviews with people who are dying forgive me i forgive you it 's a chance to have a sense of and it 's hard but that 's why we 're alive right when i first heard from ted and chris a few months ago about the possibility of the i was completely floored i wrote my fifty words and a few weeks later chris called and said go for it so here is my wish that you will help us take everything we 've learned through storycorps and bring it to the world so that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history how are we going to do that with this and it has powers i never could have imagined eleven years ago when i started storycorps it has a microphone it can tell you how to do things and it can send audio files those are the key ingredients so the first part of the wish is already underway over the past couple of months the team at storycorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring storycorps out of our booths so that it can be experienced by anyone anywhere but at this very moment we 're releasing a public beta version of the storycorps app the app is a digital facilitator that walks you through the storycorps interview process helps you pick questions and gives you all the tips you need to record a meaningful storycorps interview and then with one tap upload it to our the real challenge is up to you to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across america and around the world so that instead of recording thousands of storycorps interviews a year we could potentially record tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even more imagine for example a national homework assignment where every high school student studying u s history across the country records an interview with an elder over thanksgiving so that in one single weekend an entire generation of american lives and experiences are captured or imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world sitting down not to talk about that conflict but to find out who they are as people and in doing so begin to build bonds of trust 75th birthday or that people in your community go into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons armed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society and and how they want to be remembered ten years ago i recorded a storycorps interview with my dad who was a psychiatrist and became a well known gay activist this is the picture of us at that interview it was june i listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died and i knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that i thought i couldn 't believe in storycorps any more deeply than i did but it was at that moment that i fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings"
