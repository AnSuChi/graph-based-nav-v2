  "transcript": "probably not but people like me do i 'm an archeological geneticist at the center for evolutionary medicine at the university of zurich and through this work i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future there are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine and one way is to extract human dna from ancient but this is only one half of the story the most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation microbes and parasites and our immune response but there are a lot of challenges for this and first of all what do we even study but of course all of the soft tissue has decomposed and the skeleton itself has limited health information and they 're actually extremely interesting you can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease but they are very rare to address this problem i put together a team of international researchers in switzerland denmark and the u k to study a very poorly studied little known it 's a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus many of you and in a typical dentistry visit you may have about fifteen to thirty milligrams removed but in ancient times and what 's really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton and and what they had found was things like pollen and what we found is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth we also have but what was surprising to us and also quite exciting is we also found bacteria that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems so it gives us virtual access to the lungs which is where many important diseases reside and so by applying ancient dna sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet infection and immunity thousands so what started out as an idea is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long term evolutionary history of human health and disease right down to the genetic and from this information we can learn about how pathogens evolve and as a final parting thought on behalf of future archeologists i would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth"
