  "transcript": "the imagination as we know it came into being when our species descended from our progenitor homo erectus infused with consciousness began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world for a time we shared the stage with our distant cousins neanderthal who clearly had some spark of awareness but whether it was the increase in the size of the brain or the development of language or some other evolutionary catalyst we quickly left neanderthal gasping for survival and i spent two months in the caves of southwest france with the poet clayton eshleman who wrote a beautiful book called juniper fuse and you could look at this art and you could of course see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being we weren 't and he viewed a kind of original attempt through ritual to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost so he saw this art not as hunting magic but as postcards of nostalgia and viewed in that light it takes on a whole other resonance and the most amazing thing about the upper paleolithic art and it was also the beginning of our discontent because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the paleolithic it would come down to two words adaptive imperatives we all have children the elders who fall away into their elderly years all of this is part of our common experience and this shouldn 't surprise us because after all biologists have finally proven it to be true but the corollary of that is that if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material all human populations share the same raw human genius the same intellectual acuity and so whether that genius is placed into technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the west or by contrast into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation there is no progression of affairs in human experience there is no trajectory of progress there 's no pyramid that conveniently places victorian england at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so called primitives of the world but what do i mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence ten thousand square kilometers by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their these are sailors who in the darkness in the hull of the vessel can distinguish as many as thirty two different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time distinguishing local wave disturbances from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean that can be followed with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea indeed if you took all and i recently made a film called the buddhist science of the mind why did we use that word science what is i travelled for a month in nepal with our good friend the well being of all sentient creatures and he sat with and told us about the four noble truths the essence of the buddhist path the cause of suffering is ignorance by that the buddha did not mean stupidity he meant clinging to the illusion that life is static and predictable the third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome and the fourth and most important of course was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart but had two thousand five hundred years of empirical and so when this door opened onto the face of a woman who had not been out of that room in fifty five years you did not see a mad woman you know we don 't really believe you went to the moon but you did you may not believe that we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime but we do and if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical to the sacred geography of peru the population has its own reciprocal obligations i spent thirty years living amongst the people of chinchero you start off at eleven thousand five hundred feet you and of course the waylakama spin the trajectory of the route is marked by holy mounds of earth where coke is given to the earth libations of alcohol to the wind the vortex of the feminine is brought to the and at forty eight i was the only outsider ever to go through this only one to finish it i only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the 4 000 year history of the plant but these localized rituals become pan andean and these fantastic festivals like that of the it 's kind of like an andean woodstock sixty thousand indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred the metaphor is so clear you bring the crosses from your community in this wonderful fusion of christian and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses now these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to like machu picchu machu picchu was never a lost city on the contrary it was completely linked in to the fourteen thousand but more importantly it was linked in to the andean notions of sacred geography the hitching post to the sun is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light that falls on the sacred apu of machu picchu which is sugarloaf climb huayna picchu find another the second of the most important mountains of the incan empire but what is enveloping machu picchu from below the but it 's also the trajectory that viracocha walked at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being and where does the river right on the slopes of the koariti so five hundred years after columbus these ancient rhythms of landscape are played out in ritual now when i was here at the first are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization if those of you who are here remember that i mentioned that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother 's womb values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the to see if this could possibly be true as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist they consume more coca leaves than any human population the gourd you see here is everything in their lives is is symbolic their central metaphor is a loom they say upon this loom i weave my life they refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient as threads when they pray for the dead they make these gestures with their hands spinning their thoughts into the heavens you can see the calcium buildup on the head of the gourd is a feminine aspect the stick is a male you put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes well they 're not ashes they 're burnt limestone to empower the coca leaf to change the ph of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride the measure of a man 's life has fields are planted in such an extraordinary way that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women the other side is planted like that by the men metaphorically you turn it on the side and you have a piece of cloth and they are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization the greatest goldsmiths of south america who in the wake of the conquest retreated into this isolated volcanic massif that soars to twenty thousand feet above the caribbean coastal plain there are four societies the kogi kankwano and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man danilo villafane if we just jump back here for a second when i first met danilo in the colombian embassy in washington i couldn 't help but say you know you look a lot like an old friend of mine well it turns out he was the son of my friend adalberto from and i said danilo you won 't remember this but when you were an infant i carried you on my back up and down the mountains and because of that danilo invited us to go to the very a man who i 've known since one and this is one of those initiates no it 's not true that they 're kept in the darkness for eighteen years but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men 's circle for eighteen years this little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men 's hut for all that time until he begins his journey of initiation for that entire time the world only exists as an before we could begin our journey we had to be cleansed at the portal and it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest and you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet there must be nothing between the feet and the earth for we traveled high into the paramo and then of course as we reached our final destination a place called mamancana we were in for a surprise because the farc were waiting to kidnap us we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night in a quite dramatic scene it 's going to look like a john ford western the mamos went into a circle of divination we were able to because we had trained people taking the elements from the highlands to the sea there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well being they call themselves the elder brothers they dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the younger brothers now if we slip to another end of the world i was up in the high arctic to tell a story about global warming inspired in part by the former vice president 's wonderful book and what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the inuit a people who don 't fear the cold but take advantage of it a people who find a way with their imagination to carve life out of that very frozen a people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death but an affirmation of life and yet tragically when you now go to those northern communities you find to your astonishment that whereas the sea ice used to come in in september and stay till july in a place like kanak in northern greenland it literally comes in now in november and stays until march so their entire year has been cut in half you know if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see you discover that the world is not flat the world remains a rich tapestry it remains a rich topography of the spirit these myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being new failed attempts and when asked that question they respond with six thousand different voices and collectively those voices become our human repertoire for dealing with the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia right now as we sit here in this room of those six thousand languages spoken the day that you were born fully half aren 't being taught to children so you 're living through a time when virtually half of humanity 's intellectual social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away this does not have to happen these peoples are not failed attempts at being modern quaint and colorful and destined to fade away as if by natural law in every case these are dynamic living we can also be and must be the facilitators of cultural survival"
