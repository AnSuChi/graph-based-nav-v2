  "transcript": "in kenya people cross oceans and they kill lions might be wondering who are these people these are the i 'm actually one of them the boys are brought up to be warriors the girls are brought up to be mothers when i was i found out that i was engaged to be married as soon as i reached puberty my mother my grandmother my aunties they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by cool yeah and everything i had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age twelve my day started at five i did everything that i needed to do ' women or girls were going to 's because my mother was denied an education and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living why did she say that my father worked as a policeman we didn 't see him for sometimes even two years it was a different case my mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat but when my father came he would sell the cows he would sell the the products we had and he went and drank with his friends in and by default everything in my family and if my mother ever questioned him he beat her abused her and really it was difficult they wear nice dresses high heeled shoes i found out later that they are uncomfortable but i admired it most of all the teacher was just writing on the board not hard work that 's what i thought it was a determining factor in our tradition there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become this was the crossroad i was going to become a wife so i talked i had to come up with a plan to figure these things out i talked to my father i did something that most girls have never done i told my father i will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school my father will have a stigma so he figured out it 's a whole week long of excitement it 's a ceremony people are enjoying it and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in yes we danced and danced we walked out to the courtyard and as we danced and danced and we approached this circle of women men women children everybody was there and this woman was waiting to hold us and it off i was lucky because one also mom did something that most women don 't do i was so determined to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference i met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the university of oregon this man was wearing a white t shirt jeans camera white sneakers and i 'm talking about white sneakers there is something about clothes i think and shoes they were sneakers i told him and he told me well what do you mean you want to go don 't you have a husband waiting for you and i told him don 't worry about that part just tell me how to get there but the problem is my father is not the only father i have everybody who is my dad 's age male in the community is my father by default my uncles all of them and they dictate what my future is i applied and i couldn 't come and here again when the men heard and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school we can 't do this there 's a belief among our people that because there 's good news in so i went to him very early in the morning as the sun rose the first thing he sees when he it 's me my child what are you doing here well dad i need help can you support me to go to america i will come back anything they wanted after that i will do it for he said well but i can 't do it alone he gave me a list of another fifteen men that i went sixteen more men every single morning i went and visited them they all came together the village the women the men everybody came together to support me i found snow i enjoyed myself i learned that it was called i learned that i did not have to trade part of my body three million girls in africa are at risk of going through i learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman after i graduated from here i worked at the u n i went back to school to get my graduate work the constant cry of these girls was in my face i had to do something i started talking to the men to the village and mothers and i said i want to give back the way i had promised you that i would come back and help you what do you need as i spoke to the women they told me you know what we need we really need a school for the mother is blamed for that if she got pregnant the mother is blamed for that and she 's punished she 's beaten they said we wanted to put our girls in a safe place and i went to talk to the fathers the fathers of course you can imagine what they said we want a school for boys and i said they donated land angeline came to apply for the school and she did not meet any criteria that we had angeline had been moving from one place because she 's an orphan she has no mother she has no father moving from one grandmother 's house to another one from aunties to aunties she had no and i looked at her i remember that day and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angeline we gave her the opportunity to come to the class five months later that is angeline a transformation had begun in her life angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world but in the entire division that we are in that 's sharon that 's five years later that 's evelyn five months later that is the difference that we are making as a new dawn is happening in my school a new beginning is happening as we speak right now one hundred and twenty five girls will never be mutilated one hundred twenty five girls will not be married when they 're twelve years old one hundred twenty five girls are creating and achieving their dreams this is the thing that we are doing giving them opportunities where they can as we speak right now women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we 've started in our community i want to challenge you are i want to challenge you today because people will follow you be the first people will follow you be bold stand up be fearless move out because as you change your world as one country at a time you are going to change your country and think about that if you do that and i do that thank you very much"
