  "transcript": "i work with a species called bonobo and i 'm happy most of the time because i think this is the happiest species on the planet well kept secret this species lives only in the congo because of their sexual behavior their sexual behavior is too human like for most of us to be comfortable with but we have a lot to learn from them because they 're a very egalitarian society and they 're a very empathetic society and sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside it permeates their and i think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of divided our lives up into lots of parts but i don 't think that we were that way initially there are many hard wired maybe it 's something special in his brain i don 't know there were tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire so when you compare them to the bonobo the bonobo is a little hairier and we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are i think we 've attributed it to our biology he 's a bonobo right now he 's in a forest in georgia his mother originally came from a forest in africa and she came to us when she was just at puberty about six or seven years of age clearly the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking just as we are this shows the bonobo compared to an australopithecine like lucy as you can see there 's not a lot of difference between the way a bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked as they turn toward us you 'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and now we see all grow densely in the area almost three decades ago one discovery was that wild bonobos often walk go say hello to austin first and then go to the a frame ss this is kanzi and i in the forest none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained tricks they all happened to be captured on film spontaneously by nhk of japan we need more sticks too i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one that 's a wasps ' nest you can get it out i hope i have a lighter can use the lighter to start the fire ss so kanzi but i think he 's learning about how to keep a fire going he very happy about this part you 've got to put some water on the fire you see the water 's got the pedals down but not the wheel she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel knows that that individual in the mirror is her video narrator by raising bonobos in a culture that is both bonobo and human and documenting their development across two decades scientists are exploring how cultural panbanisha is trying to give nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors in the wild parent bonobo is known to groom its offspring here panbanisha uses scissors instead of her hands to groom nyota subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this nyota tries to imitate panbanisha by using the scissors himself carefully tugs to get the scissors back kanzi 's learned to make stone tools video kanzi now makes his tools just as our ancestors may have made them two and a half million years ago by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other he can make much larger sharper flakes kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough even with requiring great skill kanzi 's rock is from gona ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two and a half million years ago the flat sharp edges are like knife compare them to the tools our ancestors used they bear a striking resemblance to kanzi 's panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods something we didn 't think they would do video for several days now panbanisha has not been outside ss i normally talk about language video then panbanisha does something unexpected ss but since i 'm advised not to do what i normally do i haven 't told you that these apes have language it 's a geometric language she writing ss she 's also saying the name of that with her voice video now she comes up to dr sue and starts writing again ss these are her symbols on her keyboard they speak when she touches them video panbanisha is communicating to dr sue where she wants to go compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest first we didn 't really realize what she was doing until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it video this lexigram the curved line is very similar to the lexigram the next symbol panbanisha writes represents collar it indicates the collar that panbanisha must wear when she goes out requirement video this symbol is not as clear as the others researchers began to record what panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk soon she began to write as well the bonobo 's abilities have stunned scientists around the world because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others that are important to you are saying to you the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them this environment brings out unexpected potential in kanzi and panbanisha then he peers eagerly into his mother 's mouth is he looking for where the sound came from dr sue thinks it 's important to allow such curiosity to flourish she wasn 't forced to learn the piano saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun filled environment which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities stay away from them now now you can chase them again time to chase them now you have to stay away get away run away run now we can chase them again and they 're learning to become like us because we believe that it 's not it 's culture so we 're sharing tools and technology and language with another species"
