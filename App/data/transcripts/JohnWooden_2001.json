  "transcript": "being a little bit disappointed and [ disillusioned ] perhaps by the way parents of the youngsters in my english classes expected their youngsters to b they thought a c was all right for the neighbors ' children because they were all average but they weren 't satisfied when their own it would make the teacher feel that they had failed or the youngster had failed and that 's not right the good lord in his infinite wisdom didn 't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned any more than we 're equal for size not everybody could earn an a or a b and i didn 't like that way of judging and i did know how if you won them all you were considered to be reasonably successful because i found out but it seemed that we didn 't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted quite frequently i really felt that they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic manner but and give the youngsters under my supervision be it in athletics or the english classroom aspire other than just a higher mark in the classroom or more points in some athletic contest i thought about that for quite a spell and and i knew how mr webster defined it as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige or something of that sort worthy accomplishments perhaps but in my so i wanted to come up with something of my own and i recalled i 'm sure at the time he did that i didn 't it didn 't well somewhere i guess in the hidden recesses of the mind it popped out years later never try to be better than someone else learn from others the master said ' thou didst thy best i coined my own definition of success which is peace of mind attained only through if you make the effort to do the best of which you 're capable trying to improve the situation that exists for you i think that 's success and i don 't think others can judge that it 's like character reputation your reputation is what you 're perceived to be your character is what you really are and i think that character is much more important than what you are perceived to be you 'd hope they 'd both be good but they won 't necessarily be the same well that was my idea that i was going to try to get across to the youngsters i ran across other things i love to teach and it was mentioned by the previous what i should be but i think i 'm better than i would have been if i hadn 't run across certain things one was just a little verse that said no written word no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be nor all the books on all the shelves it 's what the teachers are themselves that made an impression on me and i tried to use that more or less in my teaching whether it be in sports or whether it be in the english classroom i love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow maybe it 's because dad used to read to us at night by coal oil lamp we didn 't have electricity i ran across this one verse i ran across another one someone asked a lady teacher why she taught and after some time she said she wanted to think about that then she came up and said they ask me why i teach and i reply unbiased wise another daniel webster silver tongued a doctor sits beside him whose quick steady hand may mend a bone or stem the life blood 's flow upward rise the arch of a church he builds wherein that minister may speak the word of god and lead a stumbling soul to touch the christ and all about a gathering of teachers farmers merchants laborers and i may say i may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow but yet again i may they ask me why i teach and i reply ' where could i find such splendid company ' and i believe the teaching profession it 's true you have so many youngsters and i 've got to think of my youngsters many many teachers and other professions and that that gives you a great deal of pleasure to see them go on i always tried to make the youngsters feel that they 're there to get an and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two and you 're not going to have any very long so that was the idea that i tried to get across i had three rules pretty much that i stuck with practically all the time i 'd learned these prior to coming later on i said certain things the players if we were leaving for somewhere had to be neat and clean there was a time when i i made them wear jackets and then i saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks and thought it 's not right for me to keep this other [ rule ] so i let them just they had to be neat and clean so i wouldn 't let him go he couldn 't get on the bus he had to go home and and get cleaned up to get to the airport but i felt at practice for example we start on time we close on time the youngsters didn 't have to feel that we were going to keep them over when i speak at coaching clinics i often tell young coaches and at coaching clinics more or less they 'll be the younger coaches getting in the profession when you get older it doesn 't make any difference but and another one i had was not one word of profanity one word of profanity and you and the third one was never criticize a teammate but i am paid to do it not like the coaches today for gracious sakes no it 's a little different than working hard and enjoying what you 're doing coming up to the apex you have to have patience to we want things to happen we talk about our youth being impatient a lot they are they want to change everything they think all change is progress and we get a little older we sort of i believe that we must believe truly believe providing we do what we should i think our tendency is to hope things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time but we don 't do the things that are necessary to make those things i worked on this for some fourteen years and i think it helped me become a better teacher but it all revolved around that original definition you know a number of years ago there was a major league baseball umpire by the name of george moriarty he spelled moriarty with only one ' i ' i 'd never seen that before but he you 'd be surprised how many that was one more than he had in his head at various times but he wrote something where i think he did what i tried to do in this pyramid he called the road ahead or the road behind he said sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can 't win is yet there lives on the ancient claim we win or lose within ourselves the shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow 's game you and i know deeper down there 's always a chance to win the crown but when we fail to give our best we simply haven 't met the test of giving all and saving none until the game is really won of showing what is meant by grit of playing through when others quit of playing through not letting up it 's bearing down that wins the cup of dreaming there 's a goal ahead of hoping when our dreams are dead of praying when our hopes have fled yet losing not afraid to fall if bravely we have given all for who can ask more of a man and so the fates are seldom wrong no matter how they twist and wind it 's you and i who make our fates we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind reminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us don 't whine don 't complain don 't make excuses just get out there and whatever you 're doing do it to the best of your ability and no one can do more than that i tried to get across too that my opponents will tell you you never heard me mention winning never mention winning my idea is that and i just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game i used to say that when when a game is over and you see somebody that didn 't know the outcome i hope they couldn 't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you that 's what really matters if you make an effort to do the best you can regularly the results will be about what they should be not necessarily what you 'd want them to be but they 'll be about what they should only you will know whether you can do that and that 's what i wanted from them more than anything else and as time went by and i learned more about other things i think it worked a little better as far as the results but i wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct i believe it was one great philosopher who but it 's the getting there that 's the fun as a basketball coach at ucla i liked our practices to be the journey and the game would be the end the end result i liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play and see whether i 'd done a decent job there again it 's getting the players to get that self satisfaction in knowing that they 'd made the effort to do the best of which as far as the individuals are concerned i i was asked one time about that and they said suppose that you in some way could make the perfect player what would you want but i 'd want one i 'd want one to realize that that defense usually wins championships but i 'd want one who would play offense too i 'd want him to be unselfish and and i 'd want one that could pass and would pass i 've had some that could and wouldn 't and i 've had some that would and could i wanted them to be good inside too i 'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends too why not just take someone like keith wilkes and let it go at that he had the qualifications not the only one but he was one that i used in that particular category because i think he he made the effort to become the best there was a couple i mention in my book they call me coach and one was doug mcintosh when i saw them i thought oh gracious if these two players either one of them they were different years but i thought about each one at the time he was there oh if he ever makes if he 's good enough to make it and you know one of them was a starting player for a season and a half the other one his next year played thirty two minutes in a national championship game did a tremendous job for us the next year he was a starting a starting player on the national championship when he was so those are the things that give you and neither one could jump very well and so they did well rebounding they remembered that that every shot that 's taken they assumed would be missed i 've had too many stand around and wait to see if it 's missed of them they weren 't very quick but they played good position kept in good balance and so they they played pretty good defense for us so they had qualities that they came close to as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had so i consider them to be as successful as or many of the others that we had there were some outstanding players have i rambled enough i was told that when he makes his appearance"
