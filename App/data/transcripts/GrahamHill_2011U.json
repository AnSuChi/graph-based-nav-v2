  "transcript": "whatever it is must be pretty important because i 've traveled with it moved it from apartment you know that we americans have about three times the amount of space we did fifty years ago three times so you 'd think with all this extra space we 'd have plenty of room for all our stuff so we 've got triple the space but we 've become such good shoppers huge environmental footprints and perhaps well i 'm here to suggest there 's a better way that less might actually equal more i bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less college in your dorm whatever it was for you i bet that among other things this gave you a little more freedom so i started a project called life edited at to further this conversation and to find some i wanted it all home office sit down dinner for ten by buying a space that was four hundred and twenty sq ft instead of six hundred immediately i 'm saving two hundred grand but also a smaller footprint so how can you live to edit ruthlessly we 've got to clear the arteries of our lives and that shirt that i hadn 't worn in years it 's time for me to let it go and we 've got to learn to stem the inflow we we want space efficiency we want things that are designed for how they 're used the vast majority of the time why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three so we want things that nest we want things that stack finally we want multifunctional spaces and housewares a sink combined with a toilet a dining table becomes a bed same space a little side table stretches out to seat ten in the winning life edited scheme in a render here look at the coffee table move the moving wall so i 'm not saying that we all need to live in four hundred and twenty sq ft but consider the benefits of an edited life go from three thousand to two thousand from one thousand five hundred to one thousand so when you go home and you walk through your front door take a second and ask yourselves maybe a little more time what 's in the box it doesn 't really matter i know i don 't need it just maybe less might equal more so let 's make room for the good stuff"
