  "transcript": "when i was growing up i really liked playing hide and seek but i fell and broke my arm i actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso seven days per week i barely did it because i found it boring and painful and as a result it took me another six weeks to get better which leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder the person i believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food a process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises in order to regain the range of movement lost due to an or injury patient noncompliance can be as high as seventy percent this means the majority of patients don 't do their exercises and therefore take a lot longer to get better but patients lack the motivation to do them all of us software geeks we started building mira a p c software platform that uses this kinect device a motion capture camera to transform traditional exercises into video games let 's see how this looks the first game asks me to fly a bee up and down to gather pollen to deposit i control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion just like when i was seven years old after the cast was taken off when designing a game we speak to physical therapists at first to understand what movement patients need to do motivating objectives to follow but the software is very customizable and physical therapists can also create their own exercises i can follow my therapist 's example on the left side of the screen while on the right i see myself doing the recommended movement i feel more engaged and confident as i 'm exercising alongside my therapist with the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me this basically extends the application for therapists to create whatever exercises they think are best designed to strengthen muscles and improve balance and when i stand up i bid for the items i want to buy in two days my grandmother will be eighty two years old and there 's a fifty percent chance so reversing these problems through targeted exercise will help keep older people like my grandmother safer and independent for longer when my schedule mira briefly shows me how i progressed throughout my session adults and seniors these can be used with orthopedic or neurologic patients but we 'll i 'm so pleased this version is now in use in over ten clinics across europe and the u s and we 're working on the home version we want to enable physical therapists to prescribe this digital treatment and help patients play their way to recovery at home if my mom or i had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy then we would have been more successful thank you tom rielly so cosmin tell me what hardware is this that they 're rapidly putting away what is that made of and how much does it cost it 's a microsoft surface pro three for the demo you just need a computer and a kinect which is one hundred and twenty dollars tr right and the kinect is the thing that people use for their xboxes to do 3d games right cm exactly but you don 't need the xbox you only need a camera tr right so this is less than a four hundred dollars you can definitely use it tr so right now you 're doing clinical trials in clinics cm yes tr and then the hope is to get it so it 's a home version and i can do my exercise remotely and the therapist at the clinic can see how i 'm doing and stuff like that"
