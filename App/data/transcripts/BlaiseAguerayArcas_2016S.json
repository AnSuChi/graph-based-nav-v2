  "transcript": "the engineering discipline of making computers and devices able to do some of the things that brains do and this makes us interested and especially interested in the things that our brains do that are still far superior to the performance of computers historically one of those areas has been perception the process by which things out there in the world this is essential for our own the machine perception algorithms for example that our team makes are what enable your pictures on google photos to become searchable turning a concept into something out there into the world so over the past year our work on machine perception has also unexpectedly connected with the world of machine creativity and machine art this is a famous quote of his every block of stone has a statue inside of it and the job of the sculptor is to discover it so i think that what michelangelo was getting at is that we create by perceiving and and i 'd like to begin with a brief bit of history about what we know about brains because unlike say the heart or the intestines you really can 't say very much about a brain by just looking at it at least with the naked eye the early anatomists who looked at brains gave the superficial structures of this thing all kinds of fanciful names like hippocampus meaning little shrimp but of course that sort of thing doesn 't tell us very much about what 's actually going on inside the first person who i think really developed some kind of insight into what was going on in the brain who used microscopy and special stains that could selectively fill in or render in very high contrast the individual cells in the brain and 19th century this is from from and these structures these cells that have these arborizations these branches that can go very very long distances this was very novel at the time 19th century the revolutions of wiring and electricity we 're still more than a century later trying to finish the job that ramn y cajal started these are raw data from our collaborators at the max planck institute of neuroscience and what our collaborators have done is to image little pieces the structures you see are mitochondria and these are consecutive slices through this just for comparison 's sake the diameter of of an average strand of hair is about one hundred microns we 're looking at something much much smaller than a single strand of hair and from these kinds of serial electron microscopy slices one can start to make reconstructions in 3d of neurons that look like these so these are sort of it would be so crowded so full of of structure of wiring all connecting one was a little bit ahead of his time and progress on understanding the brain proceeded slowly over the next few decades and by world war ii our technology was advanced enough to start doing real electrical experiments on live neurons to better understand how they worked this was the very same time when computers were being invented very much based on the idea of modeling the brain of machinery as alan turing called it one of the fathers of computer science warren mcculloch and walter pitts looked at ramn y cajal 's drawing of visual cortex which i 'm showing here this looked like a circuit diagram so there are a lot of details in mcculloch and pitts 's circuit but this basic idea that that visual cortex works like a series of computational elements that pass information one to the next in a cascade is essentially correct let 's talk for a moment about what a model for processing visual information would need to do the basic task of perception is to take an image like this one and say that 's a bird which is a very simple thing for us to do with our brains but the classical computing paradigm is not one in which this task is is easy to do so what 's going on between the pixels between the image of the and those feed forward into one layer after another layer after another layer of neurons all connected by synapses of different weights and at the end of the day you have a neuron or a small group of neurons that light up saying bird now i 'm going to represent those three things the input pixels and the synapses in the neural network and bird the output x w and y there are maybe a million or so x 's a million pixels in that image there are billions or trillions of w 's which represent the weights of all these synapses in the neural network and there 's a very small number of y 's of outputs that that network is only four letters right and we all know that if you have one equation you can solve one variable by knowing the other two things so the problem of you know the pixels as you can see that 's actually a relatively straightforward problem you multiply two times three and you 're done i 'll show you an artificial neural network that that we 've built recently doing exactly that this is running in real time on a mobile phone amazing in its own right that mobile phones can do so many billions and trillions of operations per per second what you 're looking at is a phone looking at one after another picture of a bird and actually not only saying yes it 's a bird but identifying the species of bird with a network of this sort and the y is the unknown i 'm glossing over the very difficult part of course which is how on earth do we figure out the w the brain that can do such a thing how would we ever learn such a model if we were doing this with the with the simple equation in which we think about these as numbers we know exactly how to divide by two and we 're done the problem is with this operator so division we 've used division because it 's the inverse to multiplication but the multiplication is a bit of a lie here this is a very very complicated very non linear operation it has no inverse so we have to figure out a way to solve the equation and the way to do that is fairly straightforward you just say and that 's the sort of thing computers are very good at as it does that it 's getting successive approximations to w = two point nine nine nine which is close enough and this is the learning process remember that what 's what 's been going on here is that we 've been taking a lot of known x 's and known y 's and solving for the w in the middle through an iterative process this is not a bird so now we 've held x and w fixed to solve for y that 's everyday fast perception we figure out how we can solve for w that 's learning which is a lot harder because we need to do error minimization using a lot of training examples and about a year ago alex mordvintsev on our team decided to experiment with what happens if we try solving for given a known w and a known y but what is the picture of a bird and the result turns out to be a picture of birds and doing that iteratively here 's another fun example this was a work made by mike tyka in our group which he calls animal parade it reminds me a little bit of william kentridge 's artworks in which he makes sketches rubs them out makes sketches rubs them out and creates a movie this way in this case what mike is doing is varying y over the space of different animals in a network designed to recognize and distinguish different animals from each other and you get this strange escher like morph from one animal to another here he and alex together have tried reducing the y 's to a space of only two dimensions thereby making a map out of the space of all things recognized by this network doing this kind of synthesis or generation of imagery over that entire surface varying y over the surface you make a kind of map a visual map of all the things the network you can do this with other kinds of networks as well this is a network designed to recognize faces to distinguish one face from another psychedelic picture of me from multiple points of view at once the reason it looks like multiple points of view at once is because that network is designed to get rid of the ambiguity of a face being in one pose or another pose being looked at with one kind of lighting another kind of lighting so when you do this sort of reconstruction if you don 't use some sort of guide image or guide statistics then you 'll get a sort of confusion of different points of view so you can see it 's not but you start to get something more like a coherent face rendered using my own face as a guide you don 't have to start with a blank canvas or with white noise when you 're solving for x you can begin with an x that is itself already some other image that 's what this little demonstration is this is a network that you could also use the face network to hallucinate into this and you get some pretty crazy stuff or mike has done some other experiments in which he takes you can get a sort of fugue state of the network i suppose or a sort of free in which the network is eating its own tail so every every image is now the basis for what do i think i see next what do i think i see next what do i think i see next i showed this for the first time in public to to a group at a lecture in seattle called higher education this was right after marijuana was legalized like to finish up quickly by just noting that this technology is not constrained i 've shown you purely visual examples because they 're really fun to look at it 's not a purely visual technology and then a computer in his backpack writes a poem using neural networks based on the contents and that poetry neural network has been trained on i think that per michelangelo i think he was right perception and creativity are very intimately connected what we 've just seen are neural networks that are entirely trained to discriminate or to recognize different things in the world able to be run in reverse to generate one of the things that suggests to me is not only that michelangelo really did see the sculpture in the blocks of stone but that any any creature any being any alien that is able to do perceptual acts of that sort is also able to create because it 's exactly the same machinery that 's used in both cases also i think that we start to have computer models that can do exactly these sorts of things and that ought to be unsurprising the brain is computational and finally it was very much modeled after the idea of how could we make machines intelligent and we finally are starting to fulfill and i think that computing is not just about accounting or playing candy crush or something from the beginning we modeled them after our minds thank you very much"
