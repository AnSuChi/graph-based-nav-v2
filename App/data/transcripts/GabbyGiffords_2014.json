  "transcript": "you were meeting with constituents which is something that you loved doing as a congresswoman and mark you were happily preparing for your next space shuttle and suddenly everything that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever she didn 't have much other information she just said gabby was shot a few minutes later i called her back and i actually thought for a second well maybe i just imagined getting this phone call i called her back and that 's when she told me that gabby had been shot in the head and from that point on i knew that our lives were going to be a lot different pm and when you arrived at the hospital what was the prognosis that they gave you about gabby 's condition and what recovery if any you could expect mk well for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury they typically can 't tell you much every injury is different it 's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable which is another tbi kind of injury so they didn 't know how long gabby would be in a coma didn 't know know when that would change and and what the prognosis would be pm gabby has your recovery been an effort to create a new gabby giffords or reclaim the old gabby when you look at the picture behind us to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do i don 't know anybody that 's as tough as my wonderful wife right here pm and what were first signs that recovery was not only going to be possible but you were going to have some semblance of the life that you and gabby had planned mk well the first thing for me was gabby was still kind of but she did something when she was in the icu hospital bed that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a and at that point i knew pm and there were certain words too didn 't she surprise you with words in communication she latched on to the word chicken which isn 't the best but certainly is not the worst laughter what 's been the toughest challenge for you during she wants to say she just can 't get it get it out she understands everything but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture the part of your brain which is where the bullet passed through pm so you have to do a very dangerous thing speak talking being able to move your arm and leg gg but i 'm optimistic pm that seems to be the number one characteristic of gabby french horn mk it 's only my wife who could be and then about a month ago she says i want to learn spanish again pm well let 's take a little closer look at and she 's on a motor scooter there but it 's my understanding that 's a very tame image she used to race motorcycles velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar pm i have a feeling we might see that picture next so what attracts you to gabby mk well when we met it was the last time we were in vancouver about ten years ago we met in vancouver on a trip that we were both taking to china that i would actually from my background i would call it a boondoggle and we met here at the airport before a trip to china pm would you describe it as a whirlwind she invited me on a date where 'd we go gabby which was just outside gabby 's state senate district were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment in the state of arizona so she couldn 't get anybody else to go with her and i 'm like of course i want to that might have contributed to the reason that gabby decided to marry you you were willing to go to death row after all special relationship we 've gone through some tough times and it 's only made it stronger gg stronger pm after you got married however you continued very independent lives actually you didn 't even live together mk we had one of those commuter marriages in our case it was washington d c houston and we didn 't really live together within an hour of gabby gabby being shot i was on an airplane to tucson and that was the moment where that had changed things pm and also gabby you had run for congress after being a state senator legislation is often at a but my wife and i have to admit a lot of other members of congress that i know work incredibly hard i mean gabby would run around like a crazy and whenever she was awake she was working and she really really thrived on that and still does today gg yes yes pm installing solar panels on the top of her house i have to say so after the tragic incident mark you decided to resign your position as an astronaut even though you were supposed to take the next talked you into going back and you did end up taking mk kind of i 'm in tucson you 've got to find a replacement for me so i didn 't actually resign from being an astronaut but i gave up my job and they found a replacement which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position it 's a challenging role but at some point you 've got to figure out when you 're going to get your life back and at the time i couldn 't ask gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again and i knew it was the right thing to do pm and yet i 'm trying to imagine mark what that was like going off onto a mission one presumes safely but it 's never a guarantee and knowing that gabby is mk well not only and you 've got two vehicles moving at seventeen thousand five hundred miles an hour i 'm actually flying it looking out the window a literally at that time having the final surgery to the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic yeah which is the whole side of her head if any of you guys would ever come to our house in tucson for the first time gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of tupperware that has the real skull and you got out of the rehabilitation center got yourself to washington so that you could walk on the floor of the house i can barely talk about this without getting emotional and cast a vote the debt ceiling mk yeah we had that vote i guess about five months after gabby was injured and she made this bold decision to go back a but she wanted to be there to have her voice heard one more time pm and after that resigned and began what has been a very slow and what 's life like day to day did a great job with this dog he 's a fabulous service dog pm so gabby what have you learned from your experiences the past few years this is a picture of family and friends gathering but i love these pictures because they show the gabby and mark relationship now and you describe it gabby over and over as deeper on so tragic happens in a family it can pull people together here 's us watching the space shuttle fly over over tucson the space shuttle endeavour the one that i was the commander on its last flight on its final flight on top of an airplane on a seven hundred and forty seven on its way to l a nasa was kind enough to have it fly over tucson and yet gabby how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook gg i want to make the world a better place pm and you 're doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you you are people who have done service to your country and you are continuing to do that with a new initiative a new purpose and gabby what 's on the agenda now gg americans for responsible solutions mk that 's our political action where we are trying to get members of congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country and to try to pass some reasonable legislation gg yes yes mk you know this affected us very personally but it wasn 't what happened to gabby that got us involved it was really the twenty murdered first graders and kindergartners newtown connecticut and the response that we saw afterwards where look what 's happened so far so far the national response has been pretty much to do nothing we 're trying to change that pm there what are you doing that 's different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities gun owners we support gun rights at the same time we 've got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill it 's not too difficult to do that and we 're trying to bring some balance to the debate you just keep challenging yourself and the sky seems to be the limit i have to share this video of your most recent adventure take a look at gabby who was injured in combat had a really rough time gabby visited him when he was at bethesda and went through a really tough period he started doing better months later gabby was shot in the head and then he supported her while she was in the hospital in houston so they have a very very nice connection hello everyone it 's been a long hard and you can too get involved with your community set an example be passionate be courageous be your best"
