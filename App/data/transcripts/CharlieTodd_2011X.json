  "transcript": "now this took place and that 's me right there in a brown coat it 's about thirty degrees outside i 'm wearing a hat i 'm wearing a scarf and the girl 's going to notice me right here and as you 'll see now i 'm not wearing pants so at this point at this point she 's noticed me but in new york there 's weirdos on any given train car one person 's not that unusual she goes back to reading her book which is unfortunately titled so she 's noticed the unusual thing but she 's gone back to her normal life now in the meantime i have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well they 're going to be entering this car one by one we 'll act as though we don 't know each other and we 'll act as if it 's just an unfortunate mistake we 've forgetting our pants on this cold january day point she decides to put the rape book away and she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings now in the meantime the two danish guys to the left of the camera they 're cracking up they think this is the funniest thing they 've ever seen before and watch her make eye contact with them right about now and then once it became a shared experience it was funny and something that she could laugh at so the train is now pulling into the third stop so the video won 't show everything this goes on for another four stops a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear at the eighth stop a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar like you might sell batteries or we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants put them on and said thank you that 's exactly what i needed today and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions thank you so that 's a still from the video there and i i love that girl 's reaction so much and watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what i do and really one of the points of improv everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people it 's a prank but it 's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell and her reaction inspired me to do a second annual no pants subway ride and we 've continued to do it every year this january we did the 10th annual no pants subway ride where a diverse group of five hundred people rode the train in their underwear in new york almost every single train line in the city and also in fifty other cities around the world people participated as i started taking improv class at the upright citizens brigade theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians i started amassing a mailing list which had just been built and she was very much onstage and i couldn 't figure out why she was doing so it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this so i got inspired by that looking at the entire facade there were seventy total windows and i knew what i had to do and i stood in the park giving signals the first signal was for everybody to hold up these four foot tall letters that spelled out look up more and then we had dancing we had everyone dance and then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them so then i gave a new hand signal which signaled the next soloist down below in forever twenty one and he danced and i was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement and because it was in union square park right by a subway station there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing there 's a better photo of it so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened to stumble upon the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger a high school kid in texas wrote me in two thousand and six and said you should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a best buy and stand around we had about eighty people show up to participate entering also don 't shop just stand around and don 't face products now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt everybody else is one of our actors several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us a lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers you can see them in this footage they 're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt and we were there probably ten minutes before the managers decided to dial nine hundred and eleven so they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming watch out the cops were ultimately the police had to inform best buy management that it was not in fact illegal to wear a blue polo so we had been there for twenty minutes we were happy to exit the store one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras but the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the best buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to so i like that concept of using their own technology against them and one morning so i decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning so this was in the winter of two thousand and nine eight thirty in the morning it 's morning rush hour it 's very people are coming in from queens transferring from the e train to the six train and they 're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs and he washed his hands before and afterward and although no one seemed to care so i 'd say over the years one of the most common criticisms i see of improv everywhere left anonymously on youtube comments is these people have too much time on their hands the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way you know looking at a football game saying all those people in the stands they have too much time on their hands and of course they don 't it 's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a but i think it 's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with two hundred people in the grand central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical or diving into the ocean in coney island wearing formal attire you know and i think that 's sort of the point of improv everywhere it 's that there is no point and that there doesn 't have to be a point we don 't need a reason as long as it 's fun and it seems like it 's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time then that 's enough for us and thank you very much"
