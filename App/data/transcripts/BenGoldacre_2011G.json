  "transcript": "and nobody really knows what epidemiology is epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you and it 's best understood through example as the science of those crazy and these are just some of the examples these are from the daily mail every country in the world has a newspaper like this it has this bizarre ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimate divorce wi fi toiletries and coffee some things they say prevent cancer crusts red pepper licorice and coffee so you can see there are contradictions coffee both causes and prevents cancer as you start to read on you can see that maybe there 's some political valence behind some of this and what i hope to show is that unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims isn 't a kind of nasty it 's socially useful but it 's also an an extremely valuable it 's what happens and nobody minds that we actively welcome it it 's like a consenting intellectual s & m activity and i will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong we 'll start with the absolute weakest form of evidence known to man and that is authority in we don 't care how many letters you have after your name we want to know what your reasons are for believing something how do you know that something is good for us or bad for us gillian mckeith every country has somebody like this she is our tv diet she it she also boasts that she 's a certified professional member of the american association of nutritional consultants which sounds very glamorous you get a certificate this one belongs to my dead cat hettie she it arrives in the post that 's not the only reason we think this person is an idiot she also and anybody who 's done school biology remembers that chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight we need proper science proper evidence so red wine can help prevent breast cancer this is a headline from the daily telegraph in the uk a glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer so you find this paper and piece of science it 's a description of the changes in the behavior of one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish but on the question of your own personal risk of getting breast cancer if you drink red wine it tells you absolutely bugger all actually it turns out that your risk of breast cancer this is from britain 's leading diet nutritionist in the daily mirror our second biggest selling newspaper an australian study in two thousand and one found that olive oil in combination with fruits vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection obviously nobody has been able to go and then we see how many wrinkles you 've got later you have but that 's because who eat fruit and veg and olive oil are freaks they have better social support are less likely to smoke for a host of fascinating interlocking social political and cultural reasons they 're less likely to have wrinkles that doesn what you want to do is a trial people think they 're familiar with the idea of a trial trials are old the first one was in the bible daniel one twelve it 's straightforward take a bunch of people split them in half treat one group one way the other group the other way a while later you see what happened to each of them i which is probably the most this is the trial of fish oil pills the claim fish oil pills they said we did a trial all the previous ones were positive this one will be too that should ring alarm bells if you know the answer to your trial you shouldn 't be doing one either you 've rigged it by design or these huge fish oil pills six of them a day measure their school exam performance and compare now can anybody spot a flaw in this design and no professors of clinical trial methodology are allowed to answer this question so there 's no control we all develop over time and of course there 's the placebo effect one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine it 's not just taking a pill and performance or pain improving it 's about our beliefs and expectations the cultural meaning of a treatment and this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of that 's an outrageous and ridiculous finding but it 's true we know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment than a sugar pill a dummy pill with no medicine in it not because the injection pills do anything physically to the body but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention so we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated which is why we do trials where we control but that 's not enough what i 've just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes what i find really fascinating but slightly more sophisticated versions of them everybody thinks a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo but in a lot of situations that 's wrong repeatedly which is useless for a doctor like me trying to but that 's not the only way you can rig your data you can also rig your data so people aren 't properly treated a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in the promise was they would have fewer side effects so people set about doing trials of the new drugs against the old drugs and it 's a foregone conclusion if you give a drug at that high a dose it will have more side effects and your new so you see trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone but very much at the high end of normal so you 're bound to make your new drug look better and so it 's no surprise that overall industry funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials but and it 's a big but when you look at the methods used by industry funded trials that they 're actually better than independently sponsored trials so how does this work how can we explain this strange phenomenon well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action it 's withheld from doctors and patients and this is the most important aspect of the whole story it 's at the top of the pyramid of evidence we need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective there are two different ways you can spot whether some data has gone missing you can use statistics or you can use stories i prefer statistics so that 's what i 'll do first this is a funnel plot a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have this is a graph of all of the trials done on a particular treatment as you go up towards the top of the graph what you see is each dot is a trial as you go up those this is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias and i think that 's the funniest epidemiology joke you will have prescribed to patients and i 'm a very nerdy doctor i hope i go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature i read the trials on this they were all positive all well conducted i found no flaw unfortunately it turned out that many of these trials were withheld in fact now if you think about it if i tossed a coin a hundred times then i can convince you that i have a coin with two heads if we remove half of the data we around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld but it goes way beyond that the nordic cochrane group were trying to get ahold of the data on that to bring it all together cochrane groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown and they need to have access to all of the trial data but the companies so did the european medicines agency for three years this is a problem that is currently lacking a solution and to show how and they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug which will but i don 't care about that governments don 't care i 'm sorry if you have the flu i know it 's horrible but we 're not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day which are based in italy has been trying to get the full data in a usable form this is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem so it 's a little bit difficult from there but i would say this i think that sunlight is the best disinfectant finger around at the mechanics and peer in thank you very much"
