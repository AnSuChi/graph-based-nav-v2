bottle labeled d stevenson glen lane paisley but as the remaining ginger beer was poured into her tumbler a decomposed snail floated to the surface of her three days later she was admitted to the glasgow royal infirmary and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock the case of donoghue vs stevenson that followed set a very important legal precedent stevenson the manufacturer of the ginger beer was held to have a clear duty of care towards may donoghue even though there was no contract between them and indeed she hadn 't even bought the drink one of the judges lord atkin described it like this you must take care to avoid acts or omissions indeed one wonders now please hang on to that paisley snail story because last the hansard society a nonpartisan charity which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy and encourage greater public involvement in politics alongside their annual audit of political engagement an additional section tabloid newspapers do not appear to advance the political citizenship of their readers are twice as likely to agree with a negative view of politics than readers of no newspapers they 're not just less politically engaged they are consuming media that reinforces their negative evaluation of politics thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical attitude to democracy and their own role within it little wonder that the report concluded that in this respect and especially over the past decade or so a great deal of thinking has been developed around the notion mentally or economically this is principally focused on obvious areas such as our empathetic response to children and young people to our service personnel and to the elderly and infirm to equally important arguments around the fragility of our present system of government participatory democracy and the more you think about it the stranger that is a the pleasure of opening a brand new school in the northeast of england it had been renamed by its pupils as academy three hundred and sixty as i walked through their impressive glass covered atrium in front of me emblazoned on the wall in letters of fire was marcus aurelius 's famous injunction the head teacher saw me i kept thinking can it really have taken us over two thousand years to come to terms with that simple notion as being our minimum expectation of each other isn 't it time that we develop this concept of a duty of care and extended it to include a care for our shared but increasingly endangered after all the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence and that being the case can we be really comfortable with the thought that we 're in effect being negligent in respect could anyone honestly suggest on the evidence that the same media which hansard so roundly condemned have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen would be likely to undermine or even damage it has to be possible to balance freedom of expression with wider moral and social let me explain why by taking the example from my own career as a filmmaker throughout that career i never accepted that a filmmaker should set about putting their own work outside or above what he or she believed to be a decent set of values for their own life and the future of the society in which we all live filmmakers journalists even bloggers are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium obviously this is not a mandated duty but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger it strikes me as being utterly inescapable we should always remember that our notion of individual freedom and its partner creative freedom is comparatively new in the history of western ideas and it can prove very very hard to reclaim and and its first line of defense has to be our own standards not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation our own standards and our own integrity our integrity as we deal with those with whom we work and these standards of ours need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda they 're part of a collective responsibility the responsibility of the artist or the journalist to deal with the world as it really is and this in turn must go hand in hand with the responsibility of those governing society and as a policies of the parties of protest and their appeal to a largely disillusioned older demographic along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial that typifies at least some of the young taken together these and other similarly contemporary aberrations the most ardent of libertarians might argue that donoghue v stevenson should have been thrown out of and that stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he 'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it but most of us i think accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care and the key word here is reasonable far from signifying overbearing state power it 's that small common sense test of reasonableness after all set the tone and the content for much of our democratic discourse and they do so in an atmosphere which strives for the type of understanding that leads not agreement then at least a productive and workable compromise it 's about reconciling conflicting preferences wherever and whenever possibly based on fact but if the facts themselves are distorted resolutions are likely only to create further conflict with all the stresses and strains on society that inevitably follow the media have to decide do they see their role as being to inflame it comes down to a combination of trust and leadership"
