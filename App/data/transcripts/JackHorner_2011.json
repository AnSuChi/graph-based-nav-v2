  "transcript": "when i was growing up in montana and i wanted to have a pet and so i wasn 't very good at reading things in fact i don 't read much of anything and so reading is the hardest thing i do but instead i go out and i find things then i just pick things up i basically practice for finding money on the street and i wander about the hills and i have found a few things and i have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests the first dinosaur embryos and and it happened to be at a time when and so at that time i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies brought food to their babies and traveled in i have gone on to find more things and and discover that that dinosaurs really were very social we have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults the adults can recognize the juveniles and so we 're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like and they didn 't just all chase jeeps around but it is that social thing that that i guess attracted michael crichton and in his book he talked about the social animals and then steven spielberg the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of jurassic park michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life you all know the story right i assume everyone here has seen jurassic park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap otherwise known as amber that has some blood sucking insects in it good ones because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur dna out and you take your dna back to the laboratory and you clone it and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg or something like that and then you wait and lo and behold out pops and everybody 's happy about that and they 're happy over and over again they keep doing it they just keep making these things and and then then then and then then the dinosaurs being social and they conspire and of course that 's what makes steven spielberg 's movie conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you and you did it over and over and over again you 'd have a room full of mosquitos applause and probably a whole bunch of trees as if you want dinosaur dna i say so that 's what we 've done back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the national science foundation and one of my former doctoral students mary schweitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so and she actually found some very interesting structures in there they found these red and they 're in what appear to be the and so she thought well what the heck so she but she did find which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin we tried and tried and we couldn 't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell creek project and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern montana there 's a lot of space a lot of badlands and not very many people and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of and we called it b rex and b rex was found but it was a very special b rex and i and my colleagues cut into it and we don 't really know how long dinosaurs lived because we haven 't found the oldest one yet we gave samples to mary schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the medullary tissue is the calcium build up now but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find dna but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples and we did we got better material the cells looked better the vessels looked better so we have discovered that dinosaur dna and all dna just breaks down too going to be able to do what they did in jurassic park we 're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on but we actually classify them as dinosaurs we now call them avian dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don 't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them but look at the velociraptor the velociraptor is cool the chicken is not the chicken is a dinosaur i mean it really you can 't argue with it because we 're the classifiers and we 've classified it that way but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken laughter so that 's what i 'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken so we have a number of of ways that we actually can we actually have some evolutionary tools we we have selection wolf like creature and we ended up with a maltese definitely genetic modification or any of the other funny looking little dogs that 's how people make glofish you take a glow gene out of and they obviously make a lot of money off of them glow rabbits and glow all sorts of things i guess we could make a glow chicken but i don 't think that 'll satisfy the sixth graders either but there 's another thing there 's what we call atavism activation and atavism activation is basically an atavism is an ancestral characteristic and so there are a number of and here 's an example this is a chicken with teeth a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in we can save that one we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth that 's better than a glowing chicken and he 's looking at them by looking at the embryo he 's also interested in the transformation and i said and so he agreed and so that 's what we 're looking into if you look at dinosaur hands a a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else another bird has kind of a weird looking but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks so we can get a chicken that hatches out birds have basically and so we know that as the animal is developing it actually has but a gene turns on and resorbs the so that 's the other gene we 're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so what we 're trying to do really is modify it and make the chickenosaurus and people always say why do that why make this thing what good is it well that 's a good question actually i think it 's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and quite frankly i think if sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece anyway when our dino chicken hatches thank you"
