  "transcript": "a sculpture i made which is a way of kind of freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom this is a bronze ball an aluminum arm here and then this wooden disk and the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you 'd want to hold on to and that would glide easily through your hands durable material that could roll on the ground inside of the bronze ball there 's a lead weight that on an axle that 's across it like this that counterbalance this this weight so it it allows it to to roll and the sphere has that balance property that it always it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction but if you put something on top of it it disbalances it and so it would tip over but in this case because and then there was a second level to which is that it i wanted it to convey some proportions that i was interested in which is the diameter of the moon and the diameter of the earth in proportion in proportion to each other i was exploring really early on wanting to make things float in the air and i thought up a this is sculpture that i made that it 's magnetically levitated thing is is that it 's slightly dangerous normally it 's sort of cordoned off when it 's in a museum but it 's uh let 's see if i can manipulate it a little bit without um which stabilizes it in all directions except there is a slight tether here keeps it from going over the top of its field it 's sort of surfing i have a sort of a collection of videos that i took of different installations which i could narrate this is a sculpture of the sun representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two so here is the earth it 's a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze and then in a series of fifty five balls it reduces proportionately this is in a this one is about the the moon and then the distance to the earth in proportion and then this is and so this is the size of the and then each of these little spheres is the size of the earth in proportion to the sun i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist so this on the and it 's floating and this is in france right at the center of gravity or just slightly above the center of gravity which means that the the lower half of the object is but it 's being balanced like that in it 's susceptible to motion by the air currents this is another species of work that i do these are these arrays these spheres are all suspended but they have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses so all the red sides for example face one direction south and the blue side the compliment faces the other way so as you turn around you 're seeing different colors this is based on the structure of a diamond it was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure and then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows then i had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres so they would catch parts of the images and this is something i did of a tactile communication system it was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture and then putting it into a communication this is a clock i designed it has buckminster fuller 's dymaxion map edited here it turns once per day this is like projects that fresh water that can fly from place to place this would be grown i suppose with nanotechnology in the future sometime in the course of doing doing my work i sort of have a broad range of interests and some of it is just the idea of creating media media as a sculpture something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever changing by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of and i had a lot of always interested in the concept of a crystal ball and the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future i in the late ' 60s when i was just starting out i was under the influence of thinking about buckminster fuller 's grand project for an electric globe across from the united nations and and other things that were happening the space program at that time and whole earth catalog things like that i was thinking about so this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations but this the the current version of it is is a flying airship that is about thirty five meters in diameter about one hundred and ten feet the whole surface of it is covered with sixty million diodes red blue and green that allow you to have i came with a plan i brought it to paul maccready 's company aerovironment to do a feasibility study and they analyzed it and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen this is the control room inside of the ship the idea of this air genie is it 's something that can just transform and become anything it 's like a traveling show it has speakers on it and it has cameras over the surface the cabin it has on board generators it can generate about a million kilowatts in order to be the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show it really would be dedicated to to the arts and to interacting there would be on board a crew of artists musicians that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment and to interact as an entity that it could be interacted with large crowds in the default image on the object would probably be but then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues or migrations all of the things that we 're concerned with today could interact with that"
