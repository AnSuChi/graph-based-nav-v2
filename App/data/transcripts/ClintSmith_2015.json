  "transcript": "growing up i didn 't always understand why my parents made me follow the rules that they did why couldn 't i put jelly beans in my oatmeal my childhood was abound with questions like this normal things about being a kid it was best to listen to my parents even when i didn 't exactly understand why and it 's not that they didn 't want me to think critically their parenting always sought to reconcile the tension between having my siblings and i understand the realities of the world while ensuring that we never accepted the status quo as inevitable i came to realize that this in and of itself was a very purposeful form of education one speaks quite explicitly about the need for education to be used as a tool for critical awakening and shared humanity in his most famous book pedagogy of the oppressed he states no one can be authentically human while he prevents others from being so and specifically who in this world is afforded the privilege of being perceived as fully human over the course of the past several months these events and all that has transpired after them have brought me back to my own childhood and the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in america that growing up i didn 't always understand in the way that i do now i think of how hard it must have been how profoundly unfair it must have felt for them to feel like they had to strip away parts of my childhood just so that i could come home at night when i was around twelve years old on an overnight field trip to another city soakers and turned the hotel parking lot into our own water filled battle zone before i could but you can 't act the same as your white friends you can 't pretend to shoot guns you can 't run around in the dark you can 't hide behind anything other than your own teeth that some man would mistake this water these are the sorts of messages i 've been inundated with my entire life take off your hood when the sun goes down my parents raised me and my siblings in an armor of advice an ocean of alarm bells so someone wouldn 't steal the breath from our lungs so that they wouldn 't make a memory of this skin so that we could be kids not casket or concrete and it 's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else it 's simply because they wanted to keep us alive given to us when we became old enough to be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered to the ground when people made our melanin synonymous with but what does it do to a child to grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child but this cannot be what defines us because we have parents who raised us to understand that our bodies and not just to signal surrender and that the only thing we should give up is the idea that we aren 't worthy of this world so when we say that black lives matter it 's not because others don 't it 's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear when so many things tell us we are not i want to live in a world where my son will not be presumed guilty the moment he is born where a toy in his hand isn 't mistaken for anything other than a toy and i refuse to accept that we can 't build this world into something new some place where a child 's name doesn 't have to be written on a t shirt or a tombstone where the value of someone 's life isn 't determined by anything other than the fact that they had lungs"
