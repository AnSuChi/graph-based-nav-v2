  "transcript": "seeing some of my friends leaving the school because their parents could not afford textbooks when i was twenty seven hearing the plight of a desperate slave father whose daughter was about to be sold to a brothel at the age of fifty along with my own son dear friends for centuries teachers priests everyone taught us how to control and suppress our anger but i ask why why can 't we use our anger to challenge and change the evils of the world that i tried to do like when i was but i will come to that later on let me begin with i had been a big admirer of mahatma gandhi since my childhood but more importantly he taught us how to treat the most vulnerable sections the most deprived people with dignity and respect and so when india was celebrating mahatma gandhi 's birth centenary in and sixty nine at that time i was fifteen an idea came to my mind i knew as perhaps many of you might know that in india a large number of people are born in the lowest segment of caste these are the people forget about they cannot even go into the houses and shops so i i was very impressed with the leaders of my so inspired by that i thought let us set an example by inviting these people i went to some it 's not possible it never happened they are against untouchability they will come if nobody comes we can set an example these people thought that they were convinced my friends and i took our bicycles and invited rather empowered i thought great idea we can set an example we can bring about change in the society all these they i could recall that they brought new utensils it was the moment of change they gathered food was cooked it was seven o 'clock by eight o 'clock we kept on waiting because it 's not very uncommon that the leaders become late for an hour or so we took our bicycles and went to these leaders ' homes just to remind them one of the leader 's wives he is having some headache perhaps he cannot come i went to another leader and his wife told he will definitely join so i thought that i went back to the venue which was a newly built mahatma gandhi park none of the leaders showed up that made me angry rather exhausted i broke down in tears and suddenly i felt a hand and it was the healing motherly touch of an untouchable woman and she told me kailash why are you crying you have eaten the food cooked by untouchables which has never happened in our memory i saw my mother and elderly women were crying and they were pleading to these elderly people because they had threatened to outcaste my whole family and you know outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of and the punishment was purification that means i had to go six hundred miles away from my hometown and after that i should organize a feast for priests one hundred and one priests wash their feet and drink that water and i refused to accept that punishment i was barred from entering into my own kitchen and my own dining room my utensils were separated but i decided to outcaste the entire caste system and that was possible because the beginning would have been to change the family name or surname later on i gave a new name to myself maybe one of you can tell me what i was an engineer an electrical engineer and then i learned how the energy coal raging river currents fierce winds i also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy so i 'll come back to i was very happy freeing a dozen children from slavery tiny that 's not done and i believed in the power of consumers and let me tell you that this was the first time when a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world to educate and sensitize the consumers to create a demand for rugs in europe and america we have been successful it has resulted in a fall in child labor in south asian countries by eighty percent not only that but this first ever consumer 's power or consumer 's campaign maybe chocolate maybe apparel maybe shoes it has gone beyond my anger at the age of eleven when i realized how important education is for every child i got an idea to collect used books and help the poorest children i created a book bank at the at the age of but i did not stop later on i cofounded the world 's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the global campaign for education that has helped in changing and that has concretely helped the reduction of my anger at the age of twenty seven to free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel has given me an idea to go for a new strategy of raid and rescue freeing children from slavery and i am but my colleagues and i have been able to physically liberate eighty three thousand child slaves and hand them over back to their families and mothers i knew that we needed global policies organized the worldwide marches against child labor and that has also resulted in a new international convention and the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down by one third in the last fifteen years anger is an energy and the law of nature is that energy can never be created and never be vanished so why can 't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world a more just and equitable world anger is within each one of you and i will share a secret for a few seconds that if and the circles of then the anger will turn out to be hatred but if we are able to break the circles then the same anger could we can break the circles by using our inherent compassion and connect with the world through compassion to make this world better that same anger could be transformed into it and the angriest among us is the one inspiration to others who or what inspires you and why chris let me tell you and that is the truth each time when i free a child the child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother the first and the mother who has lost all hope that the son or daughter can ever come back and sit in her lap i see the glimpse of god in it this is my biggest inspiration and i am so lucky that not once as i said before but thousands of times thank you"
