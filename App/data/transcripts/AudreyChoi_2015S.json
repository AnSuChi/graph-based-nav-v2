  "transcript": "and i believe that we as individuals have unique power to influence the direction that those institutions take now these beliefs did not come naturally to me because trusting big institutions not really part of my family legacy my mother escaped north korea when she was ten years old to do so she had to elude every big institution in her life repressive governments later when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the united states she had to defy an entire culture that said the girls because of her bravery and passion i 've had all the opportunities that she never did and that has made my story so different instead of running away from big institutions i 've actually run toward them i 've had the chance over the course career to work for the wall street journal the white house where i lead sustainable investing and i 've become convinced that the institution of the global capital markets that that may be one of our most powerful forces for positive social change at our disposal if we ask it to be now i global capital markets positive social change not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph it 's uncaring force of nature but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don 't affect the tides don 't change the shape or size or direction of the waves and most of the rest of the capital markets is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority and their capital from us why aren 't we able to make our voices heard why can 't we make some waves so let me ask you a different question did any of you buy fair trade coffee the last time you were at a supermarket or at starbucks ok do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout miso glazed chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have do any of you drive hybrid cars or even do these things right one electric car doesn 't amount to much in a fleet of one point two billion combustion engine vehicles one fish is just one fish in the sea and one cup of coffee doesn 't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world but we do these things because we believe they matter that our actions add up that our choices might influence others and what an impact we can have so in my bag i have a coffee mug that i bought a couple of years ago it 's a reusable mug it has all these things printed on it look at some of the things that are on it that it says this one cup can be used again and again this one cup may inspire others to use one too this one cup helps save the planet i had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful so why do we think that our choice of a four dollar but what we do with four thousand dollars in our investment account for our ira doesn 't why can 't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets that we care that we care about fair labor standards that we care about sustainable production methods and about healthy communities why aren 't we voting with our investment dollars but we would vote with our lattes the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness do you remember the grimm 's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot if you said to the pot boil little pot boil it would fill up with sweet porridge and if you said stop little pot stop it would stop and things could go terribly awry only those words said exactly that way will make the pot fill up with gold add in some extra words like protect the spell might not work put in the wrong words like promote social justice and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely according to this fable so we asked people what do you really think overwhelmingly people wanted to add those extra words into the formula seventy one percent of people said which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance seventy one percent wanted that seventy two percent said that they believe that companies who did that would actually do better so people really do believe that you can do well by doing good but here was the weird thing fifty four percent of the people still said if they put their money so is it true do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade grown coffee instead of drinking it well you know the investors in companies like burt 's bees or ben & jerry 's wouldn 't say so right both of those started out as small socially conscious companies that ended up becoming so popular with consumers that the giants unilever and clorox bought them for hundreds of millions of dollars but here 's the important thing those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments they had to preserve that socially conscious but maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule right harvard business school actually researched this and they found something fascinating if you had invested a dollar twenty years ago in a portfolio of that one dollar would have grown to fourteen dollars and forty six cents that 's not bad until you consider that if instead you 'd invested that same dollar in a portfolio of companies that focused on growing their business and on the they didn 't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen they did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes like making sure the ceo contracts had the ceos incentivized for the not just quarterly results oxford also did a research study where they examined one hundred and twenty different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results and they found time and time and time again lower cost of capital and then there 's al gore so twenty years ago when i worked for al gore in the white house he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments to pay attention to the challenges of climate change far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix he actually significantly sustainable investing the good news is it doesn 't require a magic spell and it doesn 't require some investment secret it 's not just groovy sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or it 's about stocks and bonds and fortune five hundred companies it 's about mutual funds it 's about all the things we already see in the market today so here 's why i 'm convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal first preserving all the same good principles of it makes sense the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads and once you get rid of the fable you can actually start appreciating those facts we 've been talking about and third the future is already here sustainable investment today is a twenty trillion dollar market and it 's the it has grown enormously as you can see it now represents one out of every six dollars so what are we waiting for for me it goes back to the inspiration that i received from my mother she knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices and to have her voice heard and write her own story she was passionate about that goal no obstacle no big institution stand in her way and she became a teacher an award winning author and ended up sending her daughters to harvard and these days you can tell that she is amply comfortable holding court in the most it seems almost too prophetic that her name in korean means passionate clarity passionate clarity and clarity that we are able to help chart we have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices we have more power than ever before so invest in the change you want to see in the world change the fables thank you"
