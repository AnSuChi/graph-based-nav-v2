  "transcript": "emily dickinson who said that it 's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be and a tradition we may have forgotten and yet when i look at the environment outside it 's so hard to change a wall we applaud the well mannered to create a space that never existed is what interests me to create something that has never been and i think that 's really what architecture is based on architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil the greatest spaces that we have had and i think that is indeed what architecture is it is a story but it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities if you think of the great buildings of the cathedrals of the temples of the but by people so anything that has been made can be unmade anything that has been made can be made better but i think these are the necessary and i therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward it 's the only profession but architecture is and it is that belief that i think drives society and today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us and yet it is in times like this that i think architecture can thrive with big ideas ideas that are not small think of the great cities think of the empire state building the rockefeller center they were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way and yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy so again i am a believer in the i think expression and it 's like espresso coffee you know you take the essence of the coffee that 's what expression is it 's been missing in much of the architecture because we we think architecture is the realm of the neutered the realm of the kind of a state that i believe it is the expression expression of the city expression of our own space that gives meaning to and i but to reach out across the abyss of history to places we have never been and would have perhaps been had we not been so lucky so again radical versus conservative it 's something which is rooted it is actually a living it 's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending it 's actually a story you know the soviet architecture it 's about conserving emotions conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward and i think our architecture is a confrontation with our own there is a lot of i 've always been an opponent of it i think emotion is needed life without emotion would really not be life there is no reason which does not take a position in the ethical sphere in the philosophical mystery of what we are so i think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space into city life and i think that is what makes the world a wondrous place and but the fact that they incarnate emotions but of those who live there as well but it is not a language that can be reduced but the story is very short which says we have no story to tell you in light they connect themselves into various sources into a kind of complex vector matrix that isn 't really frontal but is really embedded in the lives and in the history of a city and of a people so again the notion that a building should just be explicit but the computer should not just be the glove of the hand the hand should really be in all its physiological though we don 't have to be mystical about it we realize that the hand has been given us and i think but are not computer drawings drawings that can come from sources that are completely not not seen yet the hand and that 's what i really to all of you who are working how can we make the computer i think that 's part of what because and i think brain surgery atomic genetics and as wondrous as it is it cannot be reduced to a kind and yet our lives are complex our emotions are complex our intellectual desires are complex so i do believe that architecture as i see it of course that means that architecture is political the political is not an enemy of architecture the politeama is the city it 's all of us and i 've always believed that the act of architecture even a private house when somebody else will see it is a political act because it will be visible to others and we live in a world which is connecting us more and more so again and i do believe that this interaction with the history with history that is often very difficult to grapple with it to create a it 's also just like life the asking of questions but the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart the human soul and architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere so the reality of architecture is the bed such prosaic objects and yet i try in every building to take that virtual world which is so enigmatic and so rich and create something in the real world create a space for an office a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real you know it 's true the cathedrals as unexpected will always be unexpected you know frank gehry 's buildings they will continue to be unexpected in the future so not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability but an architecture that is full of tension an architecture that goes beyond itself and yet the raw i would say is the naked experience so the rawness i think but a space that might be cool in terms of its a space that but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities other experiences that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture and of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy and so i do like something which is pointed not blunt something which is focused through its leverage to transform even a very small space so architecture maybe is not so big like science but through its focal point it can leverage in an archimedian way what we think the world is really about and often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done what has been done how the world i do believe that in there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought that blunt technique but something that pinpoints and can point in various directions without interested in the forgettable which of course get accolades of critics critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way but i rather play something completely unheard of and even with flaws than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness so again memory is the city memory is but those who remember us which means that architecture is not mute it 's an art of communication it tells a story the story can reach into obscure desires it can reach into sources that are not explicitly available it can reach into millennia so again i think the notion that the best architecture is silent and that indeed is the architectural mission that i believe is important is to create that are vibrant that are pluralistic that can transform the most prosaic activities and of course risk you know it costs a lot of money and so on but yes it should not play it safe it should not play it safe because if it it 's not moving us in a and i think of course risk is what underlies the world world without risk would not be worth living risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of it 's about creating with minimal means something which can and there of course is the space that we need to breathe is the space we need to dream it 's not about the changing fashions changing it 's about carving out a space for trees it 's carving out a space where nature can and i think that is there is so many interests and compromise i was inspired when i came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others looking at america from that point of view demonstrated have you come to to peace with the process that happened at ground zero and the loss of the original incredible design that you came up with daniel libeskind look and shape the process in the best way possible i was taught not to be a loser not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight you have to fight for what you believe you don 't always win everything you you want to win but for the world"
