  "transcript": "like most journalists i 'm an idealist i love unearthing good stories especially untold stories i just didn 't think that in two thousand and eleven women would still be in that i 'm the president of the journalism and women symposium jaws that 's sharky i joined ten years ago because i wanted female role models and i was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession and what that meant for our image in the media we make up half the population of the world but we 're just twenty four percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories it 's possible to remove women from the picture completely you can see hillary clinton on the right let 's see how the photo ran in an orthodox jewish newspaper based in brooklyn the paper apologized but said it never runs photos of women they might be sexually provocative but the fact is women are only nineteen percent of the sources in stories on politics and only twenty percent in stories on the economy the news continues to give us a picture where men outnumber women in nearly all occupational categories except two students even in stories on gender based violence men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime case in point this march the new york times ran a story by james mckinley about a gang rape of a young girl eleven years old in a small texas town mckinley writes that the community is wondering how could their boys have been drawn into this drawn into this like they were seduced into committing an act of violence and the first person he quotes says these boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives except that she wore clothes that were a little old for her your stories are constructed as reporters we research we interview we also have our own unconscious biases i disagree with that the times revisits the story this time it adds another byline to it with mckinley 's erica goode what emerges is a truly sad horrific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty she was raped numerous times by many men but her bed was still covered with stuffed animals it 's a very different picture perhaps the addition of ms goode is what made this story more complete the global media monitoring project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters at kunm here in albuquerque elaine baumgartel did some graduate research on the coverage of violence against women so for her graduate work she did a three part series on the murder of eleven women found buried on albuquerque 's west mesa she tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work and she tried to show the challenges that journalists face from external sources their own internal biases and cultural norms she 's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts wired magazine november here 's the thing wired almost never puts women on its cover oh there have been some gimmicky ones pam from the office manga girls a voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds reading wired chris anderson the editor wired defended his choice and said there aren 't enough women prominent women in technology to sell a cover to sell an issue here 's my problem with that argument how many people knew the founders of facebook and google putting them there made them more recognizable now fast company magazine embraces that idea the issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology editor robert safian told the poynter institute silicon valley is very white so it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving by the way apparently wired took all this to heart this was its issue in april that 's limor fried the founder of adafruit industries in the rosie the riveter pose it would help to have more women in positions of leadership in media a recent global survey found that shankar vedantam is the author of the hidden brain how our unconscious minds elect presidents control markets wage wars and save our lives he told the former former ombudsman at national public radio who was doing a report on how women fare in npr coverage unconscious bias flows he used to work for two editors who said every story had to have at least one female source but that the dallas morning news won a pulitzer prize in for a series it did on women around the world but one of the reporters told me she 's convinced it never would have happened if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor particularly one on female genital mutilation men would just not be allowed into those situations because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue such as afghanistan what we 're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is traditional areas she was the cbs news correspondent almost immediately pundits weighed in blaming her and saying things like maybe women shouldn 't be sent to cover those stories i never heard anyone say this about anderson cooper and his crew who were attacked covering the same story one way to get more women into leadership is to have other women mentor them one of my board members is an editor at a major global media company but she never thought about this as a career but this is not just a job for analyze your news and speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage like people at the new york times did suggest female sources to reporters and editors remember a complete picture of reality may depend upon it and i 'll leave you with a video clip that i first saw in it 's for the guardian newspaper it 's actually long before i ever thought about becoming a journalist but i was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world but it 's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what 's going on"
