  "transcript": "drawing of the brain it optic nerve flowing out from the back imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works and all you could see was a keyboard a mouse a screen nobody was able to do that with formless there 's no structure it won 't tell you anything new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring the computer was cracked open so what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the golgi stain and it works in a very particular way instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue it somehow only stains about one percent of them it clears the forest reveals the trees inside if everything had been labeled spanish neuroanatomist santiago ramon y cajal who 's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience applied this golgi stain which yields data which looks like this and very quickly cajal realized that neurons don 't operate alone but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer now green fluorescent protein which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent is very useful because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell that cell will glow green and so coming back to the brain this is from a genetically engineered mouse called of neurons molecules rather than the entire cell but it recognize specific molecules inside of the brain recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually and a lot of the images i 've been showing you here are very beautiful but they 're also very powerful they have great explanatory power this for example is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain and in order to understand how serotonin works it 's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is and antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question tissue were developed and"
