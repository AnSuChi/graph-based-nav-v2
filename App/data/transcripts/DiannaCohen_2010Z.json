  "transcript": "i turn them into two and three dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations upon working with the plastic after about the first eight years some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic and i thought great it 's ephemeral just like us upon educating myself a little further about plastics i actually realized this was a 's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits because it 's always still plastic and what we 're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment i then in the last few years learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre and my initial reaction and i think this is a lot of people 's first reaction to learning about it is oh my god we 've got to go out there and clean this thing up so i actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers a crane a chipping machine and a cold molding machine chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in i began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so and that actually i needed to back up and look at the bigger picture and the bigger picture is we need to find a way to turn off the faucet we need to which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale i wasn 't just concerned about plastic that you 're trying to imagine out in the middle of the pacific ocean of which i have learned there are now eleven gyres potentially of plastic in five major oceans in the world it 's not just that gyre of plastic that i 'm concerned about it 's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket i 'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic all of my beverages are packaged in plastic even at the health food market so i came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue and we created the pollution coalition but some of them are very basic one is if eighty to ninety percent of what we 're finding in the ocean of the marine debris that we 're finding in the ocean is plastic then why don 't we call it what it is it 's plastic pollution recycling everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling you put in a bin and you don 't have to think about it again while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again old school i myself am now collecting these cool pyrex containers and using those instead of glad and tupperware containers to store food in and i know that i am doing a service to myself and my family it versus purchasing but this is a problem that we 've created as consumers and we can solve we can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives so whenever possible to choose alternatives to single use plastics we can cut the stem tide the stem of this into our oceans save our planet save ourselves"
