  "transcript": "in a very small country town in victoria i i fought with my younger and when i was fifteen a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community achievement award and my parents said hm that 's really nice but there 's kind of one glaring problem with that she hasn 't actually achieved anything and they were low key after school job in my mum 's hairdressing salon and i spent a lot of time watching buffy the vampire slayer and dawson 's creek yeah i know what a contradiction but they were right you know i wasn 't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all i wasn 't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation years later and i was about twenty minutes into a year eleven legal studies class when are you going to start doing your speech and i said what speech you know i 'd been talking them about defamation 's usually in the big hall and that 's when it dawned on me this kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects to this kid and it 's not his fault i mean that 's true for many of us we 're not real people we are there to inspire i am sitting on this stage looking like i do in this wheelchair and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire i 'm afraid i 'm going to disappoint you dramatically i i am here to tell you that we have been lied to yeah we 've been sold the lie that disability is a bad thing and in the past few years we 've been able to propagate this lie even further you may have seen images like this these are just a couple of examples but there are a lot of these images out there you know you might have seen the one the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her you might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs and these images there are lots of them out there they are what we call inspiration porn laughter and i use the term porn deliberately because they objectify one group of people for the benefit of another group of people so in this case we 're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of so that we can look at them i could be that person i 've lost count of the number of times that i 've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think i 'm brave or inspirational and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile they were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name and it is objectifying these images those images objectify disabled they are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren 't so bad for you to put your worries and life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult we do overcome some things but the things that we 're overcoming are not the things that you think they are not things to do with our bodies i use the term disabled people quite deliberately because i subscribe to what 's called the social model of disability which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in so i have lived in this body a long time i 'm quite fond of does the things that i need it to do and i 've learned they 're not doing anything out of the ordinary they are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity so is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do to share those images and i know what you 're thinking you know i 'm up here bagging out inspiration and you 're thinking jeez stella aren 't you inspired sometimes by some things and the thing is i am i 'm learning not that i am luckier than them though i am learning that it 's a genius idea to use a pair of barbecue tongs to pick up things that you dropped laughter i 'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery genius we are learning from each others ' strength and endurance not against our bodies and our diagnoses but against a world that exceptionalizes and objectifies us i really think that this lie that we 've been sold about disability is the greatest injustice quote the only disability in life is a bad attitude the reason that that 's bullshit no amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp it 's just not i really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception but the norm i want to live in a world where we don 't have such low expectations of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning i want to live in a world where we value genuine and i want to live in a world where a kid in year eleven in a melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user but questioning what you think you know about it does"
