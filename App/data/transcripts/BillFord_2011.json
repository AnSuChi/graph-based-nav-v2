  "transcript": "i 've worked at ford motor company i worried about how am i going to but today i worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks triples or even quadruples and i decided about that time about age ten that it would be really cool if i was a test driver so until i think i was about twelve my dad brought home a lincoln and i snuck out and thought it 'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure eights in the snow my dad finished dinner early that evening and he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time i hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car and almost ended up in the front hall so it kind of cooled my test driving for a little while began to love cars then and my first car was a one thousand nine they 're quite literally in my so when i was born i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me and that 's a belief that i share share my other great passion is the environment and as a young boy i used to go up to northern michigan and fish in the rivers that hemingway fished in and then later wrote about and when i would and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it and so even at a young age that really resonated with me and the whole notion of environmental preservation and i really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict you can imagine my surprise when i would go to class and a number of my professors would say that ford motor company and my family was everything that was wrong with with our country they thought that and that we filled the skies with smog i joined ford but i decided that i wanted to go and see if i could affect change there and but i wanted to and i really discovered that my professors weren 't completely wrong i had some very interesting conversations as you can imagine there were some within ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that i needed to stop hanging out with environmental wackos i was considered a radical and i 'll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists and in time my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today i mean i think most people in the industry understand that we 've got to get on with it and the good news is today we are tackling the of cars and the environment and with new technology we 're reducing and i believe someday we 'll eliminate co2 emissions we 're starting to sell electric cars which is great we 're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word but i can see where we will but even as we 're in the process of doing that another huge problem is looming and people aren 't noticing and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened put in its simplest terms is one of mathematics and within our lifetime that number 's going to grow to about nine billion and at that population level our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth and with that growth comes some severe practical problems one of which is our transportation system simply won 't be able to deal with it when we look at the population growth in terms of cars it becomes even clearer today there are about eight hundred million cars on the road but with more people and greater prosperity around the world that number 's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives today the average american spends about a week a year stuck in traffic but that 's nothing compared to what 's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest today the average driver in beijing has a five hour commute and last summer many of you probably saw this there was a hundred mile traffic jam that took eleven days to clear in china in the decades to come and fifty of those cities will be of ten million people or more so you can see the size of the issue that we 're facing when you factor in population growth it 's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow frankly four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam so if we make no changes today what does tomorrow look like well i think you probably already have the picture traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge and they 're really very very inconvenient but that 's all they are but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care so what 's going to solve this well the answer isn 't going to be more of the same my great grandfather once said before he invented the model t if i had asked people then what they wanted so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads we built the interstate highway system today we need that same leap in thinking for but we also need to build smart roads smart parking smart public we need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world and up above you 've got a series of pedestrian walkways on new york city 's gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created and all of this will will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in new york from about an hour today at rush hour to about twenty minutes now if you look at hong kong they have a very interesting system called octopus there it 's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets and they 're frankly starting to save some fuel but what really inspires me is what 's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other very soon the same systems that we use today to bring music and and entertainment and gps information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network every morning i drive about thirty miles from my home in ann arbor to my office in dearborn michigan and every night i go home my commute and i often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home but very soon we 're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other so if the car ahead of me and these systems are being tested so just imagine one day very soon you 're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system so you get in your and as you get in your car your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive no more driving around looking for one which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today 's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots or think about being in new york city and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don 't have to wait in the cold to hail one or being at a future ted conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles but as we and also fossil fuels there is no one silver bullet the solution is not going to be more cars more roads or a new rail system it can only be found i believe in a global network of interconnected solutions but we 've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven 't even thought of yet our overall venture capitalists they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity as well as an enormous social and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge and it 's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power how much money and how much serious thought has really over the last three years just poured into the green energy field and we need people from all walks of life not just inventors we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they 're going to respond to this challenge this isn 't going to be solved by any one person or one group it 's going to really require a because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels traffic jams and we must have an infrastructure that 's designed to support this flexible future most people never traveled more than twenty five miles from home in their entire lifetime and since then the we don 't want to regress and lose that freedom we 're on our way to solving and as i said earlier i know we 've got a long way to go the one big issue that we 're all focused on that threatens it and that 's the environmental issue but i believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity because if you can envision as i do a future of zero emissions so let 's get started now thank you"
