  "transcript": "and it 's in the area of additive manufacturing also known as 3d printing you see this object here it looks fairly simple but it 's quite complex at the same time it 's a set of concentric geodesic structures with linkages between each one it has a symmetry such that you can 't injection mold it you can 't even manufacture it and we 're going to take the risk tonight wish us luck now 3d printing is actually a misnomer it 's actually 2d printing over and over again and it in fact uses the technologies associated with think about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page in microelectronics they use something called lithography to do the same sort of thing to make the transistors and integrated circuits and build up a structure several times these are all 2d printing and we began to be interested in 3d printing and very often as you know new ideas and that 's our story operate in this fashion where you have an object arise out of a puddle in essentially real time with essentially no waste to make a great object okay just like the movies and could we be inspired by hollywood and come and our approach would be if we could do this then we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back 3d printing from being a manufacturing process one 3d printing takes forever there are mushrooms that grow faster the layer by layer process leads to defects in mechanical properties and if we could grow continuously we could eliminate those defects and we could also start using materials self curing and we could have amazing properties so if we could pull this off imitate hollywood we could in fact address our approach is to use some standard knowledge in polymer chemistry to harness light and oxygen to grow parts continuously light and oxygen work in different ways light can take a resin and convert it to a solid can convert a liquid to a solid oxygen inhibits that process so light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another and we refer to this as clip [ continuous liquid interface production ] it has a reservoir that holds the puddle just like the t 1000 at the bottom of the reservoir is a special window i 'll come back to that the third component is a digital light projection system underneath the reservoir illuminating with light in the ultraviolet region now the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir 's not only transparent to light but it 's permeable to oxygen it 's got characteristics like a contact lens so we can see how the process works you can start to see that as you lower a stage in there in a traditional process with you make a two dimensional pattern and so in order to introduce the next layer you have to separate it introduce new resin what we 're able to do is with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it and we form a dead zone this dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick and we pull this object up and we use very the result is pretty staggering to one hundred times faster than traditional 3d printers as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface and that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of and as a chemical engineer i get very excited at heat transfer and the idea that we might one day have printers because they 're going so fast in addition because we 're growing things we eliminate the layers you don 't see the surface structure you have molecularly smooth surfaces and the mechanical properties of most parts made in a 3d printer but when you grow objects like this these look like parts which is very different than traditional 3d manufacturing and we 're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties you really want in a 3d printed object there it is that 's great you always take the risk that something like this won 't work onstage right think about vibration control or great sneakers for example we can make materials that have incredible strength high strength to weight ratio really strong materials really great elastomers so throw that and so the opportunity now if you actually make a part you can actually transform manufacturing what happens is the so called digital thread in digital manufacturing we go from a cad drawing a design to a prototype to manufacturing often digital thread is broken right at prototype because you can 't go all the way to manufacturing because most parts don 't have the properties to be a final part we now can connect the digital thread all the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing and that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things from about if you need a stent in an emergency situation instead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf that was just standard sizes having a stent that 's designed for you for your own anatomy printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties such that the stent could go away after eighteen months dentistry and making these kinds of structures even while you 're in the dentist chair these are amazing microscale structures you know the world is really good at moore 's law has driven things from ten microns and we 're really good at that but it 's actually very hard to make things from ten microns to one thousand microns the mesoscale but this process is so gentle we can grow these objects up from the bottom using additive manufacturing so the opportunity of making a part in real time that has the properties to be a final part really opens up 3d manufacturing and for us this is very exciting because this really is owning the intersection between hardware software and molecular science and i can 't wait to see what designers engineers around the world are going to be able to do with this great tool thanks for listening"
