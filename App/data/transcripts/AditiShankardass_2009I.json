  "transcript": "when i was ten years old a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school and as a special treat he took me to the pathology lab and there it was years later when i finally grew up my dream came true and it was while on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that i encountered a startling fact that i 'd like to share with you all today suffer from some developmental disorder this is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without even doing an ecg or a chest x ray to look at the heart it seemed so intuitive to me it would be necessary to look at the brain directly looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle yet despite all the advances in medical technology the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions audition a program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain and another program called statistical probability mapping allowing us to provide a much more accurate and so i became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team and we 're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders and i 'm happy to say that i 'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in india i 'd like to tell you about one such child whose story was also covered by there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time and he would probably never have too much language when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin 's brain the results were startling it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic he was suffering from brain seizures but that were actually causing symptoms that and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ almost fifty percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures these are the faces of the children that i have tested with stories just like justin all came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism attention deficit disorder mental retardation language problems instead our eeg scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn 't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments so these eeg scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment but we are now in a new era of neuroscience one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects and find the true source of so many disabilities in children so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be and one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system and all this by simply watching the child 's brainwaves"
