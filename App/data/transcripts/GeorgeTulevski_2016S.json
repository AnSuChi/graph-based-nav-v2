  "transcript": "michelangelo had this elegant way of describing it when he said every block of stone has a statue inside of it and it 's the task the sculptor to discover it somehow gluing millions of these particles together to form a statue i know that 's an absurd notion it 's probably impossible the only way you get a statue from a pile of dust is if the statue built itself if somehow we could compel millions of these particles to come together to form the statue now as odd as that sounds that i don 't build with stone i build with nanomaterials they 're these they 're so small that if this controller was a nanoparticle a human hair would be the size of this entire room and they 're at the heart of a field we call nanotechnology which i 'm sure we 've all heard about and we 've all heard how it is going to change everything and the reason is when objects get really small they 're governed by a different set of physics that govern ordinary objects like the ones we it 's like this ultimate toolkit you really felt empowered you felt like you could make anything and we were doing it and by we i mean my whole generation of graduate students we were trying to make blazing fast computers using we were constructing quantum dots that could one day go in your body and find and fight disease there were even groups trying to make an elevator to space using carbon nanotubes you can look that up that 's true but that was fifteen years ago we were never able to translate that science into new technologies into technologies that could actually impact people double edged sword the same thing that makes them so interesting their small size also makes them impossible to work it 's literally like trying to build a statue out of a pile of dust and we just don 't have the tools that are small enough to work with them so because of that all of the promise and all of the excitement has remained just that and the thing that i 'm most interested in no new types of computing now that last one that 's a really important one we just have come to expect the pace of computing advancements to go on indefinitely we 've built entire economies on this idea and it 's this convergence that this incredible pace as an example if i took the room sized computer that sent three men to the moon and back and somehow compressed it compressed the world 's greatest computer of its day so it was the same size as your smartphone your actual smartphone that thing you spent three hundred bucks on and just toss out every two years would blow this thing away you would not be impressed it would be slow you couldn 't put any of your stuff on it you could possibly get through the first two minutes of a walking dead episode if you 're lucky it 's exponential it compounds on itself year after year to the point where if you compare a technology from one generation to the next yet we know this progress may not last forever in fact the party 's kind of winding down it 's like last call for alcohol right if you look under the covers by many metrics like speed we have to do what we 've always been able to do and that is to innovate so our group 's role and our group 's mission is to innovate by employing carbon nanotubes because we think that they can provide a path to continue this pace and their nanoscale size that small size gives rise to these just outstanding electronic properties so there we have it we have this really important problem and we have what is basically the ideal solution the science is screaming at us this is what you should be doing to solve your problem let 's not go down that same 's just figure out what 's missing what are we not dealing with what are we not doing that needs to be done it 's like in the godfather right when fredo betrays his brother michael we all know what needs to be done fredo 's got to go but michael he puts it off fine i get it their mother 's still alive it would make her upset we just said what 's the fredo in our problem what are we not dealing with what are we not doing but needs to be done to make this a success and the answer is that the statue has to build itself we have to find a way somehow to compel to convince billions of these particles to assemble themselves into the technology now as it turns out this is not that alien of a problem but if you look around and there 's examples everywhere you can go to the beach you 'll find these simple organisms that use proteins basically molecules to template what is essentially sand just plucking it from the sea and building these extraordinary architectures with extreme diversity she 's elegant and smart building with what 's available molecule by molecule making structures with a complexity she 's been there for hundreds of millions of years we 're the ones that are late to the party 're going to use the same tool that nature uses and that 's chemistry chemistry is the missing tool and chemistry works in this case because these nanoscale objects are about the same size as molecules so we can use them to steer these objects around much like a tool that 's exactly what we 've done in our lab we 've developed chemistry that goes into the pile of dust into the pile of and pulls out exactly the ones we need then we can use chemistry to arrange literally billions of these particles into the pattern we need to build circuits and because we can do that we can build circuits that are many times faster than what anyone 's been able to make using nanomaterials before and eventually and we hope this is within a handful of years but there are others in renewable energy in medicine in structural materials that 's where the biggest but if we 're going to do that the scientists of today and tomorrow are going to need new tools and help to deliver on the promise of nanotechnology thank you so much for your time"
