  "transcript": "just to put everything in context and to kind of give you a background to where i 'm coming from so that a lot of the things i 'm going to say and the things i 'm going to do or things i 'm going to tell you i 've done you will understand exactly why and how i got motivated to i graduated high school in cleveland ohio and just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad we went back home finished university education got a medical degree one thousand nine hundred and eighty six and by the time i was i could barely afford to maintain my mother 's 13 year old car and i was a paid doctor this brings us to why a lot of us who are professionals are now as they say in diaspora and we don 't go back perhaps not i should certainly hope not that 's where nigeria is and just there is the delta region that i 'm sure everybody 's heard of people getting kidnapped where the oil comes from the oil that sometimes i think has driven us all crazy in nigeria but critical poverty this slide is from a presentation i gave not that long ago tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care very interesting how many people do you think what used to be the capital that 's a taxi and you have police on them so three so when these we all do i 've been on one of these and i didn 't have a helmet either and it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off has an accident and needs a hospital believe it or not some of us do survive some of us do survive and like i tell my family and my wife reminds me every time you know that if you actually need critical care critical care of any sort if you have an accident of which there are many there are accidents everywhere where do they go where do they go when they need i 'm not saying instead of typhoid the list goes on i 'm saying where do they go when they 're like me when i go back home and i do i train but i catch one of these things or i 'm chronically ill with one of those i think it 's quite significant this is where they go these are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden this is a major hospital in from a major teaching hospital in nigeria now that is less than a year old you remember all that oil yes you can say some of this is education you can say it 's i 'm saying we need more than just you know vaccination because i want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there in fact when i start boys and girls you 're cardiologists in the u s can you come home with me and do a mission i want them to think well there 's some anesthesiology and critical care look at that bag it 's been if something like this which has happened in the u k that 's where they go this is the intensive care unit this is a slide from a talk i gave about intensive care units in nigeria and jokingly we refer to it as expensive scare because it 's scary ok so these are the problems there are no prizes for telling us what the problems are i think we all know and several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems these are a few of them so what did i do there we go we 're going on a mission we 're going to do some open heart surgery i was the only brit on a team of about nine american cardiac surgeons cardiac nurse intensive care nurse i do believe in missions i do believe in aid but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier because it 's not everyone that 's going to benefit from a mission health is wealth in the words of hans rosling you get wealthier faster if you are healthy first so here we are mission big trouble open heart surgery in nigeria does he look like he 's happy you know does he look happy yes that 's the medical advice the committee chairman says yes i told you you weren 't going to be able to you can 't do this i just know it look that 's the technician we had so yes you go on all right i got him to come with me anesthesia tech come with me from the u k yes let 's just go work this thing out we get a lot of donated equipment equipment that 's obsolete equipment that doesn 't quite work or it works and you can 't fix it and there 's nothing wrong with that it looks like all these americans are here and yes but it was one of these even older than the one you saw the reason i have this picture here this x ray it 's just to tell you where and how we were viewing x rays do you nowadays everything 's on pax anyway you look at your x rays on a screen but we still need this stuff this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready people still believe in voodoo heart disease tetralogies you still get people who believe in it and they came at sixty seven percent we had to do these for adults so we did succeed we had explosions because the kit was designed was designed and installed by people who weren 't used to it the oxygen tanks didn 't quite work right but how many did we do the first one and just watch that chair all right this is what i mean about appropriate technology propping up the bed because the bed simply didn 't work have you seen one of those before no doesn 't matter it worked i 'm sure you 've all seen or heard this before we the willing have been doing so much with so little for so long this was my first company this one 's sole aim is to provide the very things that i think are missing so we put my hand in my pocket and say guys let 's just buy stuff let gives them the tools they need to keep going this one will do everything and it will do it at half the price and doesn 't need compressed air if you 're in america and you don 't know about this one we do because we make it our duty to find out what 's appropriate technology for for africa does the job and we move on anesthesia machine multi parameter this little unit here that 's exactly how the outlets are designed yes it will take a solar panel yes and guess what we have a little pedal charger too then you can customize it and currently we 're working on oxygen oxygen oxygen delivery is not new and what we will have in a few months i hope is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce 's not new zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is seventy eight percent of air if you take nitrogen out what 's left oxygen pretty much so that 's not these are the basic features of my device or our device this is what makes it so special apart from the awards it 's won it 's portable and it 's certified it 's registered the mhra and the ce mark for those who don 't know for europe is the equivalent of in the u s if you compare it with what 's on the market ease of use complexity this picture was taken last year these are members of my graduating class there are too many of us outside and everybody just to borrow a bit from hans hans rosling he 's my guy if the size of the text represents what gets the most the problems but what we really need are african solutions looking at the people looking at how much money they 've got africans have to do it thank you"
