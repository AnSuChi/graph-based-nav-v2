  "transcript": "and many corporate leaders welcome that as a chance to increase profits machines are more efficient well i want our organizations to remain human in fact i want them to become beautiful soon the only work left for us humans will be the kind of work that must be done beautifully rather than efficiently to maintain our in the this second machine age we may have no other choice than to create beauty beauty is an elusive concept for the writer stendhal it was the promise of happiness for me it 's a goal by lionel messi so bear with me as i am proposing four admittedly very subjective principles that you can use to build a beautiful organization first do the unnecessary [ do the unnecessary ] a few months ago hamdi ulukaya the ceo and founder of the yogurt company chobani some called it a pr stunt others a genuine act of giving back but there is something else that was remarkable about it it came completely out of the blue they create something out of nothing i once worked at a company that was the result of a merger of a large it outsourcing firm we were merging nine thousand software engineers with one thousand creative types and the new brand color was going to be we decided last minute which we had meant i didn 't know back then and sure enough the merger eventually failed now was it because there weren 't any orange balloons mentality permeated everything else you cut everything the second principle studies show that how we feel about our workplace very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers and what are relationships other than a string of are hundreds of these every day in our organizations that have the potential to distinguish a good life from a beautiful one the marriage researcher john gottman says that the secret of a healthy relationship is not the great gesture or the lofty promise it 's small moments of attachment in other words intimacy in our networked organizations we tout the strength of weak ties but we underestimate the strength of strong ones we forget the words of the writer richard bach who once said intimacy not connectedness intimacy is the opposite of loneliness so how do we design for organizational intimacy thirty six team members and their partners to one of the khajuraho temples known for their famous erotic sculptures and there they openly discussed their personal relationships their own experiences of gender equality it also broke down invisible barriers so this is how you create intimacy no masks or lots of masks it gathered the management team and one hundred employees from across different departments seniority levels and regions for a three day strategy retreat and it asked everybody to wear costumes for the entire meeting wigs crazy hats feather boas huge glasses and so on and they left with concrete outcomes and full of enthusiasm and when i asked the woman who had designed this experience why it worked she simply said never underestimate the power of a ridiculous wig and hierarchy kills intimacy both ways for the ceo and the intern wigs allow us to use the disguise of the false and that 's not easy in our everyday work lives because the relationship with our organizations is often like that of a married couple and is now desperate to be beautiful for one another once again the risk to be ugly [ be ugly ] so many organizations these days are keen on designing beautiful workplaces that look like anything but work vacation resorts coffee shops playgrounds or college campuses based on the promises of positive psychology we speak of play and start up even says that when someone gets fired they have graduated but ugly cuts clean to the bone as the writer dorothy parker once put it to be authentic is to be ugly it doesn 't mean that you can 't have fun or must give in to the vulgar or cynical but it does mean that you speak the actual ugly truth it identified named and pinned on large boards all the issues and there were hundreds of them that had become obstacles to better performance they put them on boards moved them all into one room and the ugly room served as a mix of mirror exhibition and operating room a biopsy on the living flesh to cut out all the bureaucracy the ugliest part of our body literally and neurologically our brain renders ugly what is unfamiliar jazz maybe vr goggles for that matter strange objects sounds and people but we 've all been ugly once we were a weird looking baby a new kid on the block a foreigner and we will be ugly again when we don 't belong the center for political beauty an activist collective in berlin recently staged an extreme artistic intervention transported them all the way to berlin and then reburied them at the heart of the german capital the idea was to allow them to reach their desired but they are much needed because things tend to get ugly when there 's only one meaning one truth only answers and no questions which is the fourth and the last of the principles [ remain incomplete ] recently i was in paris and a friend of mine took me to for up all night the self organized protest movement that had formed in response to the proposed labor laws in france and at the core of this was a general assembly where anybody could speak using a specially designed sign language like occupy wall street and other protest movements nuit debout was born in the face of crisis it was messy but whether you agreed with the movement 's goals or not every gathering was a beautiful lesson in raw humanity fitting that paris the city of ideals the city of beauty it reminds us that like great cities the most beautiful organizations are ideas worth fighting for even and especially when their outcome is uncertain they are always imperfect never fully organized so they avoid ever becoming banal they have something but we don 't know what it is they remain mysterious we can 't take our eyes off them we find them beautiful to create intimacy to be ugly to remain incomplete these are not only the qualities of beautiful organizations these are inherently human characteristics and are disrupted the least we can do is to ensure that we still feel at home in our organizations and that we use our organizations to create that feeling for others beauty can save the world when we embrace these principles and design for them we must acquire and promote a new aesthetic and sentimental education because if we we might end up feeling like aliens in organizations and societies that are full of smart machines that have no appreciation whatsoever the intimate the incomplete thank you"
