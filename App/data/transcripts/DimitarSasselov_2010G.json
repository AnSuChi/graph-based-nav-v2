  "transcript": "my talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months but as you will see actually all having to do with the story i want to tell you today the first one was actually a funeral to be more precise a reburial on may there was a hero 's reburial in frombork poland by replacing the earth with the sun in the center of the solar system and then with this he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution which many call the copernican revolution now that was ironically and very befittingly the way we found his grave copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave together with fourteen others in that cathedral dna analysis one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last four hundred years that he started was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with ' hair obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on and we know that this was indeed nicolaus copernicus now the connection between biology and dna and life even back then his followers very quickly made the logical step to ask people actually answered that question positively yes but there was no evidence and here begins four hundred years of frustration of unfulfilled dreams the dreams of galileo giordano bruno many others which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time what is life what is the origin of life are we alone and that especially happened in the the end of the 20th century when the beautiful developments due to molecular biology understanding the code of life dna but further apart from answering those basic questions are there earths around other stars and now able to answer that question it 's a new telescope and that telescope 's sole purpose is to go out find the planets that orbit other stars in our and tell us how often do planets like our own earth happen to be out there except it does have an additional lens a and in the next couple of months you walk out in the early evening and look straight up and place you palm like this you will actually be looking at the field of the sky where this telescope is searching for planets the way we do that actually is with a method which we call the transit method it 's actually that occur when a planet passes in front of its star not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that and but we learn a lot from that not only that there is a planet but we also learn its size how much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the planet is we learn about its orbit the period of its orbit and so on so what have we learned well let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand the news that i 'm here to tell you today confirm as planets so we count many many such planets and they have different sizes we do that in our solar during the ancients the solar system in that sense would look on a diagram like this even back to the time of epicurus and then of course copernicus and his followers up until recently that was the solar system four earth like planets with small radius smaller than about two times the size of the earth and that was of course mercury then the copernican revolution brought in telescopes and of course three more planets were discovered now the total planet number in our solar system was nine the small planets dominated and there was a certain harmony to that which actually copernicus was very happy to note and kepler was one of the big proponents of so now we have pluto to join the numbers of small planets and that 's what the frustration was the copernican dream was unfulfilled the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star and we actually did we only see the big planets so that 's why most of those planets are really in the category of like jupiter we haven 't gone very we were still back where copernicus was we didn 't have any evidence whether planets like the earth are out there and we do care about planets like the earth because by now we understood that life as a chemical system and we didn 't have the evidence so today i 'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope kepler has been able to tell us in the last few weeks the small planets dominate the picture the planets which are marked like earth [ are ] definitely more and the statistical result is that planets like our own earth so the question is what do we do next well first of all we can study them now that we know where they are and we can find those that we would call habitable meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen so we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own milky way galaxy and the number as you might expect is pretty staggering it 's about one hundred million such planets so that 's great because then we can go and study them remotely of course with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years we can find what they 're made of would their atmospheres have water carbon dioxide methane we know and expect that we 'll see that but that is not the whole news that 's not why i 'm here why i 'm here is to tell you that the next step and here comes biology biology with its basic question which still stands unanswered which is essentially if do we expect it to be like life on earth and let me immediately tell you here when i say life i good life human life i really mean life past and present from microbes to us humans in its rich molecular diversity the way we now understand life collectively biochemistry so the question is is that chemical or is it something which depends on the planet or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them and that 's a very basic question which we we don 't need to go to space to answer that question and so that 's what we are trying to do and that 's what many people now are trying to do and a lot of the good news comes from that part so this is one example that i want to show you here when we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life we think of compartmentalization keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane isolated from the rest of the environment but yet in an environment in which they actually could originate together and in one of our labs jack szostak 's labs it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed where you have some liquid water and some clays you actually end up with naturally available molecules which spontaneously form bubbles but those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living earth looks like like this and they really help develop change divide and do some of the processes that we call life now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon in a sense you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world as building a bridge building a bridge from two sides of the river we don 't want to go blind because there 's too and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments so that 's what we are building from the left side of the river from the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that i just showed and we hope to meet in the middle one day this underlying point is that science is in the and that is going to change our worldview in a profound way ' act did but it 's equally profound and half the time what 's happened is it 's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind to the earth in a bigger space and the more we learn the more that was reinforced you 've all learned that in school how small the earth is compared we know that let 's think of life as that entire planet because life on earth is the size of the earth and let 's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms what if that copernican so in space the earth is very small can you imagine how small it is let 's say this is the size okay from here to here do you know what the size of life in this necktie will be it will be the size of a single small atom if that was the age of the universe then this is the age of life but in a cosmic proportion this is not insignificant life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent parent and offspring so what does this tell us this tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got there is immense powerful potential in life in this universe especially now that we know that places like the earth are common and that potential that powerful potential is also our potential of you and me and if we are to be stewards of our planet earth and its biosphere we 'd better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it and the good news is we can actually let 's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one and let 's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle thank you very much"
