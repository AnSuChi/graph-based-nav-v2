  "transcript": "i 've focused on efficiency for many years but efficiency can be a cult and today i 'd like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back to a far richer reality i moved to boston i lived in boston and i bicycled every day to work the shortest route from boston but after a month that i was cycling every day on the car packed mass ave i took a different route one day i just remember a feeling of surprise surprise at finding but after the feeling of how could i have been so blind for an entire month i was so trapped in my mobile app that a journey to work became one thing only no possibility of looking people in the eyes and why because i was saving a minute out of my commute how many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions most of you if not all have and don 't get me wrong it has the power to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination i became captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by jane jacobs the result of that research has been the creation of new maps maps will get you from a to b imagination will take you everywhere so with a bit of imagination we needed to understand which parts of the city people find beautiful at the university of cambridge with colleagues we thought about this simple experiment if i were to show you these two urban ask you which one is more beautiful which one would you say players are shown pairs of urban scenes and they 're asked to choose which one is more beautiful quiet and happy and i teamed up with luca and rossano and together we aggregated those winning locations in london to build a new map of the city a cartography weighted for human emotions on this cartography you 're not only able to see and connect from point a to point b but you 're also able to see the happy participants found the happy the beautiful the quiet path far more enjoyable than participants also love to attach shared memories that 's where the old bbc building was and personal memories that 's where i gave my first and memories that 's where our research is going right now what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path to avoid robbing people it 's that simple i would like to end with this thought do you remember the truman show it 's a media satire perhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency escape the fabricated world why well if you think that thank you"
