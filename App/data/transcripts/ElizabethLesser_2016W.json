  "transcript": "i 've had several careers in my life and although they 've been varied i was a valuable and sometimes surprising things like how to start a car at 2am when it 's ten degrees below zero or how to revive a father who 's fainted at the sight of blood or how to cut the umbilical cord just so to make a beautiful belly button but those aren 't the things that stuck with me or guided me when i stopped being a midwife when i looked into the face of a newborn i caught a glimpse of that worthiness that sense of unapologetic selfhood that unique spark i use the word soul to describe that spark because it 's the only word in english that comes close to naming what each baby brought into the room every newborn was as singular as a snowflake a matchless mash up of biology and then that baby grows up and in order to fit into the family to conform to the culture to the community to the gender we 're born this way but but as we grow a lot of things happen to us that make us to hide our soulful eccentricities and authenticity we 've all done this everyone in this room is a former baby but as adults we spend so much of our time uncomfortable in our own skin like we their message to me was uncover your soul and look for that even when things are a woman 's cervix normally looks like this it 's a tight little muscle at the base of the uterus and during labor it has to stretch from this if you fight against that pain you just create more pain and you block what wants to be born i 'll never forget the magic that would happen when a woman stopped resisting the pain it was as if the forces of the universe took notice but then i remember what i learned from the mothers curious ask the pain what it 's come to deliver something new wants to be born and there was one more big soulful lesson and that one i learned from albert einstein he wasn 't at any of the births but it was a lesson about time albert einstein concluded that our normal experience of life underneath surface time is this whole other dimension where the past and the present and the future there 's nowhere to get to albert einstein called this state this when i was delivering babies i was forced off the hamster wheel sometimes i had to sit for hours and hours just breathing with the parents just being and i got a big dose of sacred awe so those are the three lessons i took with me from midwifery one uncover your soul every now and then step off your hamster wheel into deep time but they really served me recently when i took on two years ago my younger sister came out of remission from a rare blood cancer and the only treatment left for her was a bone marrow transplant and we found a match for her who turned out to be me i come from a family of four girls and when my sisters found out that i was my sister 's perfect genetic match their reaction was society there 's lots of things there 's love and there 's friendship and there 's protection but there 's also jealousy and competition in that 's where we start assembling many of those first layers that cover our soul when i discovered i was my sister 's match and i discovered that and then you replace that marrow with several million healthy marrow cells from a i also learned that bone marrow transplants are fraught with danger if my sister made it through the she still would face other challenges my cells might and both could kill her those words had a familiar ring in the context of being siblings but we also had a long history of rejection and attack we didn 't have the kind of the relationship where we talked about the deeper stuff to but when i learned about the dangers of rejection or attack i thought it 's time to change this what if we left the bone marrow transplant up to the doctors but did something that we later came to call our soul marrow transplant could we listen could we forgive could we merge would that teach our cells to do the same to woo my skeptical sister i turned to my parents ' holy text the new yorker magazine i sent her a cartoon from its pages as a way of explaining why we should visit a therapist before having my bone marrow harvested and transplanted into her body here it i have never forgiven him for that thing i made up in my head i told my sister carting around made up stories and i told her that after the transplant all of the blood flowing in her veins would be and that inside the nucleus of each of those cells is a complete set of my dna i will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life i told my slightly horrified sister i think we better clean up our relationship a health crisis like quitting a job or jumping out of an airplane and in the case of my sister saying yes during which we got down to the marrow we looked at and released years of stories and assumptions about each other and blame and shame until all that was left was love people have said i was brave to undergo the bone marrow harvest but i don 't think so what felt brave to me was that other kind of harvest and transplant the soul lifting the layers uncover your soul look for here i am with my marrow cells after the harvest that 's they call it harvest like it 's some kind of bucolic and here is my brave brave sister receiving my cells after the transplant we began to spend more and more time together it was as if we were little girls again i left the hamster wheel of work and life to join my sister on that lonely island we spent months together in the isolation unit in the hospital and in her home our fast paced society does not support we worry about the emotional drain and the financial cost and yes there is a financial cost but i was paid in the kind of currency our culture seems to have i was paid in my sister and that because of the soul baring and the truth telling we had done with each other she became more unapologetically herself with everyone she said things she 'd always needed to say she did things she always wanted to do i said my truths but more important than that i sought the truth of others it wasn 't until the final chapter of this story that i realized just how well midwifery had trained me after that best year of my sister 's life the cancer came roaring back and this time there was nothing more the doctors could do they gave her just a couple of months to live she was so small and thin i could see the blood pulsing in her neck it was my blood when she died part of tried to make sense of it all how becoming one with each other and how by facing and opening to the pain of our past we 'd finally been delivered to each other we would now be connected forever my sister left you don 't have to wait for a situation to clean up the relationships that matter to you to offer the marrow of your soul we can be like a new kind of first responder like the one to take the first courageous step we can do this with our siblings and our mates and our friends we can do this for the soul of the world"
