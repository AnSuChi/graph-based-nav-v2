  "transcript": "because it 's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn 't relate to don 't talk to strangers says stick with people like you how appealing is that it 's not really 're at our best because when we do that we learn from people who are not like us my phrase for this value of being with not like us is strangeness and my point is that in today 's digitally intensive world strangers are quite frankly not the point the point that we should be worried about is how much strangeness are we getting because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data and that means that our digital relations now depend because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries they belong to a world of people i know versus people i don 't know the question isn 't whether or not i know what can we do together that benefits us both how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people the most important changes facing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future economies of the future depend on that our social lives in the future depend on that the threat to worry about the threat to worry about is whether or not we 're getting our fair share of strangeness but they weren 't thinking so dynamically about human relations and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps in his seminal essay the strength of weak ties made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks these strangers are actually more effective at diffusing information to us than are our strong ties the people closest to us he makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us these strong ties lives actually have a homogenizing effect on us they produce sameness my colleagues and i at intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives what kinds of new routines are possible we 've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions those things that used to be very restricted whether it 's our books or music and we concluded a very important insight which was that as people 's relationships to the things in their lives change so do their relations with other people and yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat it continues to try to predict what i need based on some past characterization of who i am of what i 've already done security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks categories like friends and family and contacts and colleagues don 't tell me anything about my actual relations a more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance where at any given point in time with any single person all as a function of what i need to do right now people aren 't close or distant what if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships what if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that i need right now strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that i need right now it simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity so but also by organizations organizations that are trying to embrace whether you 're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not whether you 're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few whether you 're a teenager in her bedroom who 's trying to jostle her relations with her parents strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations we have to change the norms we have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses what interesting questions how might we think differently about our relations with people how might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people how might we think differently about our relations with technologies things that effectively become social participants in their own right the range of digital relations is extraordinary in the context thank you"
