  "transcript": "the narrative of a rising africa is being challenged about ten years ago i spoke about an africa an africa of hope and opportunity an africa of entrepreneurs an africa very different from the africa that you normally hear about poverty and disease the first has to do with rwanda a country that has gone through many trials and tribulations it 's a country with mountainous and hilly terrain a little bit like here so it 's very difficult to deliver services to people so what has rwanda said in order to save lives it 's going to try using drones to deliver lifesaving drugs vaccines and blood to people in hard to reach places in partnership with a company called zipline with and also with the gavi a global vaccine alliance and it 's getting more frequent because of climate change effects when this happens they normally wait for international appeals to raise carcasses of dead animals and so on now these countries thirty two countries came together under the auspices of the african union and decided to form an organization called the african risk capacity what does it do it 's a weather based insurance and what these countries do is to pay insurance each year about three million dollars a year of their own resources so that in the event they have a difficult drought situation or flood this money money will be paid out to them which they can then use to take care of their populations instead of waiting for aid to come the african risk capacity last year paid twenty six million dollars feed children in school and in short keep the populations but that narrative is being challenged but commodity prices have fallen many of the economies are still commodity driven and now the issue of brexit doesn 't make it any easier i never knew that the brexit and i think it 's time to take stock and to say what were the things that the african countries how do we build on all of this and learn lessons so that we can keep africa rising the first is managing our economies better the were the lost decades when africa was not doing well and some of you will remember both domestic and foreign some stability so they 'll have confidence to invest in these economies so that was number one so so this debt relief in two thousand and five loss making enterprises governments were involved in business which they had no business being privatized or closed and they became less of a burden on government the fourth thing was a very interesting thing we have about move forward with some mobile technology where africa is actually leading in the development of mobile money m pesa which all of you have heard about it took some time for the world to notice that africa was ahead in this particular technology and this mobile money is also providing a platform for access to alternative energy you know people who can now pay for we also invested more in education and health not enough the other thing was that conflicts decreased there were many conflicts on the continent many of you are aware of that but they came down and our leaders even managed to dampen some coups so based on all this there 's also some differentiation on the continent that i want you to know about because even as the doom and gloom is here there are some countries cte d 'ivoire kenya let me mention eight things you have to have more things wrong than right the first was that even though we grew we didn 't create enough jobs we didn 't create jobs for our the second thing that we did is that the quality of growth was not good enough even those jobs we created were jobs so we moved people from agriculture to commerce and working in the informal sector in the urban we created more billionaires fifty billionaires worth ninety six billion dollars own more wealth poverty the proportion of people in poverty that 's the fourth thing did decrease but the absolute numbers did not because of population growth and population growth is something that we don 't have enough of a dialogue about on the continent and i think we will need to get a handle on it particularly how we educate girls from the chinese that helped some countries but it 's not enough and as the president of the african development bank said we are still exporting commodities and exporting commodities is what it 's exporting jobs our manufacturing then governance and sometimes nonexistent institutions and i think this gives way for corruption corruption is an issue we have not yet gotten a good enough handle on and we have to fight tooth and nail that and increased transparency in the way we manage our economies and the way we manage we also need to be wary of new developed countries to fight this together otherwise we create a new reality which is not the type we want for a rising africa and finally so we have to find a way to educate better so those are the things that we are not doing right now where do we go from there i believe that the way forward is to learn to manage success very often when people succeed or countries succeed they forget what made them succeed learning what you 're successful at managing it and keeping it is vital for us so all those things i said we did right we are not consistent one regime goes out another comes in and they throw away even the functioning policies that were there before what uncertainties for business they don 't know and we see our the next thing is focusing with a laser beam on those things we did not do well first and foremost is infrastructure yes countries now recognize they have to invest in this and they are trying to do the best they can to do that we must the most important thing is power you cannot develop in the and above all we have to engage our young people we have to unleash the genius of our young people get out of we have to recognize that girls and women are a gift unleash that strength so that they can contribute to the continent but the trend is will continue to rise and i tell you businesspeople in the audience investment in africa is not for today is not for tomorrow it 's not a short term thing it 's but if you are not invested in africa then you will be missing one of the most important emerging opportunities in the world thank you you mentioned corruption in your talk and you 're known well known as a strong anticorruption fighter but that 's had consequences people have fought back and your mother was kidnapped how have you been handling this ngozi okonjo iweala it 's been very difficult thank you for mentioning the issue of the kidnap of my mother it 's a very difficult but what it means is that when you fight corruption when you touch the pockets of people who are stealing money they don 't just keep quiet they fight back and the issue for you is when they try to intimidate you do you give up and the answer had with the teams i worked with and so that 's what we did and even out of government we continued to make that point nobody is going to fight corruption for us but us and therefore and we will not be intimidated"
