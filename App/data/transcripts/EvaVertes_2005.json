  "transcript": "but first i tell you a bit about the past my grandmother was on a train to auschwitz the death death camp and she was going along the tracks and the the tracks split and somehow we don 't really know exactly the whole story but the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp my grandmother survived and and when my mother was two years old the hungarian revolution and they decided to escape hungary and ended up in to make a long story short they came to canada my grandmother was a chemist she worked at the banting institute in toronto and at forty four she died of stomach cancer i never met my grandmother but i carry on her name her exact name eva vertes and i like to think i carry on her scientific passion too i found this passion not far from here actually when i was nine years old my family was on a road trip and and and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called the hot zone it was all about the outbreak of the ebola virus and something about it just kind of drew me towards it there was this big sort of bumpy looking virus on the cover and and from when i was reading that book i knew that i wanted to have a life i wanted to be like the explorers i 'd read about in the book who went into the jungles of africa went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was so from that moment on i read every medical book i could get my hands on it wasn 't until i entered high i was fourteen and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab and hardly anyone responded but i mean why would they respond to a 14 year old anyway and i got to go talk to one professor dr jacobs who accepted me into the lab at that time i was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system so i started that and and found the results that i guess you 'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals that it really really impaired the nervous system spinal cord had breaks the neurons were crossing and from then i wanted to look not at impairment but at prevention of impairment so that 's what led me to alzheimer 's i started reading about alzheimer 's and tried to familiarize myself with the research and at the same time when i was in the i was reading in the medical library one day and i read this article about something called and they seemed to have cell and then you have this compound purine derivatives that are promoting cell growth and so i thought maybe if it can promote cell the project that i and found that so i presented those results at the international science fair which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life and there i was best in the world in medicine which allowed me to get in or at least get get a foot in the door of the big medical world and i wanted to explore it all i wanted it all at once but knew i couldn 't really get that and i stumbled across something called cancer stem cells and this is really what i want to talk to you about today about cancer at first when i heard of cancer stem cells i didn 't really know how to put the two together i 'd heard of stem cells and i 'd heard of them as the panacea of the future the therapy of many diseases to come in the future perhaps but i 'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time so how did the good and bad go together last summer i worked at stanford university doing some research on cancer stem cells and while i was doing this i was reading the cancer literature trying to again familiarize myself with this new medical field and it seemed that the more i read the more i looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it and then lung cancer arises if you drink you damage your liver and then liver cancer occurs and it was really interesting there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises these phenomenal cells if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it 's initiating cancer it 's almost as if this is a repair response and the cancer the body is saying the lung tissue we need to repair the lung and cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair because you have this excessive proliferation so this really really fascinated me really think that we can 't think about cancer let alone any disease in such black and white terms if we eliminate cancer the way we 're trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation we 're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation trying to kill it it 's almost as if we 're getting back to this starting point we 're removing the cancer cells but we 're revealing the the previous damage that shouldn 't we think about manipulation rather than elimination if somehow we can whatever that cancer has been put there to do it would it would be a repair process it seemed that the articles a lot of them focused on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer tracing where it struck me that i 'd never heard of cancer of the heart or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter and so at first i kind of thought well maybe there 's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn 't get cancer at least not that i know of i looked further into it found as many articles as i could and it was amazing because it turned out that it was very rare some articles and furthermore not only to cancer but of and what metastases are is when the tumor when a piece breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ that 's what a metastasis is it 's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous if cancer was localized we could likely remove it or somehow you know it 's contained it 's very contained but once it starts moving throughout the body that 's when it becomes deadly so the fact that not not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal but cancer didn 't seem to go to skeletal muscle there seemed to be something here so these articles were saying you know skeletal so at first the first thing i did was i emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle cancer doesn 't really go to skeletal muscle is there a reason for this and a lot of the replies i got were that muscle is terminally differentiated tissue meaning that but then again this fact that the go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely and furthermore that nervous nervous tissue brain gets cancer and brain cells are also terminally differentiated so i decided to ask why and here 's some of i guess my hypotheses that i 'll be starting to investigate this this may at the sylvester cancer and i guess i 'll keep investigating until inevitably you 're going to have more questions so i guess you could say that i 'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle and the first thing that makes me think is that tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels and you think the more highways there are in a tissue the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases you know wouldn 't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle and as well cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis which is really really the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow without angiogenesis the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and one article that really stood out to me when i was just reading about this trying to figure out why cancer doesn 't go to skeletal muscle was that it had reported sixteen percent of meaning that there there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle the angiogenesis is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels it 's the one portion of our body our heart 's always beating we 're always moving our muscles is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply so this suggests that maybe if there factor in skeletal muscle or perhaps even more an angiogenic routing factor so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow this could be a potential future therapy for cancer and another thing that 's really interesting is that there 's this whole the way tumors move throughout the body it 's a very complex system and there 's something called the chemokine network so a tumor a tumor expresses chemokine receptors and another organ a distant organ somewhere in the body will have the corresponding chemokines and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn 't express this type of molecules and the other really interesting thing is that when skeletal muscle there 's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is and furthermore when skeletal muscle is injured that 's what causes chemokines these signals saying cancer you can come to me the go signs for the tumors it causes them to highly express these chemokines so there 's so much interplay here for why tumors don 't go to skeletal muscle but it seems like by searching where cancer is not there has got to be something there 's got to be something that 's making this tissue resistant to tumors and can we utilize can we take this and apply it to cancer therapy in general now one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called and what myod essentially does so this this compound myod has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue but once myod acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells and this is why it seems as if it is so if every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way cancer occurred everybody would have cancer almost and i hate to say that but it it seems as though muscle cell possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish i really believe that the human body is very very smart and we can 't counteract something the body is saying to do it 's different when a bacteria comes into the a foreign object we want that out but when the body is actually initiating a process and we 're calling it a disease it doesn 't seem as though elimination is the right solution so even to go to go from there it 's possible although far fetched that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy if those diseases where tissues are deteriorating for example alzheimer 's the brain the brain cells die and we need to restore new brain cells new functional brain cells what if we could in the future use cancer a tumor put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells but i really believe that it may be possible these cells are so versatile these cancer and again some of these may be far fetched but i figured if there 's anywhere to present far fetched ideas it 's here at ted so thank you very much"
