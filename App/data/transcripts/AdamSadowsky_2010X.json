  "transcript": "hi there i 'm going to be talking a little bit about machines and life or more specifically what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video some of you may recognize this image this is the opening frame of the video that we created we 'll be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about now when we first started talking to ok go the name of the song is this too shall pass and we were very excited about this because of course they have a history of dancing with machines they 're responsible for this video here it goes again four guys dancing on treadmills no cuts just a static camera a fantastically viral and wonderful video so we were really excited about working with them and we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine now for those of you who don 't know a rube goldberg machine is a complicated contraption an incredibly because you know so the first is no magic everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a specifically not the other way around they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get grander so we have this warehouse we were using divided between two floors it included an exterior loading dock we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige hit play on an ipod or a tape deck or something that would start playback and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout okay and they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song they wanted it in one shot just some statistics only three actually successfully completed their run we went to home shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it 's actually in the machine so what did we learn from all of this well and we learned that small stuff stinks and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to to get right and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path it doesn 't matter what temperature it is doesn 't matter what 's in its way what else planning is incredibly important you we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things it 's been said no battle plan survives contact with the enemy i think our enemy was physics and and so while planning is important so is flexibility these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine so also put reliable stuff last stuff that 's going to run every time again small to large real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there 's no problem about it the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that 's a problem but you don 't want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn 't work right so you put that up front so that if it fails at least you know you know you don 't have to reset the whole thing months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse and the wonderful elation that we that we had when we finally completed it so it 's important to remember that whether it 's good or it 's bad this too shall we have ok go we can still do one better i think oh okay"
