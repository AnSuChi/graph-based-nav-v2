  "transcript": "this it 's built over the and so the store comes to you this is the boat that that lady was paddling around in and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles and sells directly to the people who need the boat and the paddles and this is a global business ogandiro smokes fish in makoko in and i asked her where does the fish come from up the lagoon somewhere or maybe across africa but you 'll be happy to know she said it came from here it comes from the north sea it frozen shipped down to lagos smoked and sold for a the largest garbage dump in lagos and he earns twice the nigerian minimum wage this is a shopping mall it 's traditionally called the informal economy the underground economy and aboveboard there 's nothing underground about it it 's our prejudgment that it 's underground i 've pirated the term system d from the former french colonies and that 's why i took this picture in two thousand and seven and this is the same market in two thousand and nine and i think when the organizers of this conference were talking about radical openness they i had a friend who worked at a pickle factory and the cucumbers would come flying down this conveyer belt and his job was to pick off the ones that didn 't look so good and throw them in the bin labeled relish where they 'd be crushed and mixed with vinegar and used for other kinds of profit this is the but it should come with an asterisk and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers of the world one point eight billion people around the world work in the economy that is unregulated and informal that 's a and what does that mean well it means if it were united in a single political system one it would be and that would make it the second largest economy in the world after the united states and given that projections are that the bulk of economic growth over the next fifteen years will come from emerging economies in the developing world it could easily overtake the united states and become because it means that this is where employment is one point eight billion people and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive as andrew saboru did big businesses have recognized this and what 's fascinating about this it 's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads and run around without dropping them off but the gala sausage roll is not sold in stores uac foods has recognized that it won 't sell if and it 's been sold that way for forty years it and it 's not just in africa here 's mr clean looking amorously at all the other procter & gamble products wal mart buys fifteen percent thus fifteen percent of procter & gamble 's business is with wal mart but their largest market segment is something that they call high frequency stores which is all these tiny kiosks and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses that exist in system d the and procter & gamble makes twenty percent of its money so procter & gamble says we don 't care whether a store is incorporated or registered or anything like that we want our products in that store which is a south and when they came into nigeria nigeria is the big dog in africa one in seven africans is a nigerian and when mtn came in they wanted to sell the mobile service like i get in the united states or like people get here in or in europe you 're and they came up with another plan we don 't and where 's the airtime sold it 's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets where people are and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy now most of the phones there are not second hand at all the name is a misnomer most of them are pirated they have the name brand on them but they 're not manufactured by the i guess you know china has no versace without the vowels zhuomani instead of armani s guuuci and all around the world this is how products are being distributed so for instance you can buy you can buy cuecas baratas designer underwear that isn 't really manufactured by a designer businesses tend to complain about this and their they i don 't want to take away from their entire validity of complaining about it but i did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year and they told me well you can 't quote me on this because if you quote me on this i have to kill you but the sneaker manufacturer told me that if they find that pumas are being pirated or adidas are being pirated and their sneakers aren 't being pirated they know they 've done something wrong now there 's another problem this is a real and when i think about that first of all i think that government is a social contract between but also that we 're blaming the little guy who doesn 't pay his taxes and we 're not recognizing that everyone 's fudging things all over the world including some extremely respected businesses and i 'll give you one example there was one company that paid four thousand bribes in the first decade of this millennium and and that company was the big german electronics giant siemens this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy so it 's wrong of us to blame and i 'm not singling out siemens i 'm saying everyone does it i just want to end by saying that if adam smith had framed out a theory of the flea market define things and what their facts are and third is and i 'm taking this from the great american beat poet allen ginsberg that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency alternate currencies are also very important and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks"
