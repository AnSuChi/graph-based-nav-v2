  "transcript": "i want to start with a story a la seth godin from when i was twelve years old and mount kilimanjaro and mount meru were kind of right across the chest that were also fuzzy and i it whenever i could thinking it was the most fabulous thing i owned until one day in ninth grade when i was standing with a number of the football players and my body had clearly changed and matt who was undeniably my nemesis in high school said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips but we could all ski on mount novogratz we drove to the goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously my idea being that i would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again fast forward eleven years later the and i 'm thinking no this is not possible but so curious i run up to the child of course scaring the living bejesus out of him grab him by the collar turn it over and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater i tell that we so often don 't realize what our action and our inaction i also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be that this traveled into the goodwill in virginia it destroyed the local retailing industry not to say that it shouldn 't have but that we have to get better at answering the where i was doing two things i had started a bakery with twenty unwed mothers we were called the bad news bears and our notion was we were going to corner the and because we had a good business model and i watched these women transform on a micro level but at the same time i started a micro finance bank and tomorrow iqbal quadir is going to talk about grameen which is the which now is a worldwide movement you talk about a meme but then especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade we got a lot of things right we focused on a business model we insisted on skin in the game the women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses earn more income so they could take care of their families better what we didn 't understand what was happening all around us with the ethnic strife and certainly an aid game if you will that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable the genocide happened in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream and the good news was that the institution lasted in fact it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country the bakery was completely wiped out but the lessons for me were that accountability counts understand however complex we may be incentives matter so when chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist on the one hand i absolutely agree with him because of people like tony blair and bono and bob geldof what keeps me up at night is a fear that we 'll fifty billion dollars in increased aid to africa forty billion in reduced debt as the victory as more than chapter one as our moral absolution and in fact what we need to do is see that as chapter one celebrate it close it and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution all about the how to and if you remember one thing from i want to talk about today it 's that the only way to end poverty to make it history is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services and it was that that whole philosophy that encouraged me to start my which is trying to build some mini blueprints for how we might do that and i want to talk a little bit about that and some of the examples so you can see what it is that we 're doing but before i do this and this is another one of my pet peeves i want to talk a little bit about who the poor are because we too often talk about them as these strong huge masses of people yearning to be free in fact it 's quite an amazing story on a macro level four billion people on earth make less than four dollars a day that 's who we talk about when we think about the poor if you aggregate it it 's the third largest economy on earth and yet most of these people go invisible who are these people they farmers and factory workers they work in government offices they 're drivers they are domestics they typically and they pay thirty to forty times what their middleclass counterparts pay certainly where we work in karachi and nairobi the poor also are willing to make and do make smart decisions if you give them the land is extraordinarily parched you see people on average making sixty cents to a dollar this guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named ami tabar what he did was see what was happening in israel larger approaches and figure out how to do a drip irrigation which is a way of of bringing water directly to the plant stock large scale farms so ami tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre a couple of principles build small make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor this family sarita and her husband bought a 15 dollar unit when they were living in a literally a with a corrugated iron roof after one harvest they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter acre a and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house and i swear you could see the future in that something i truly believe you can 't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets and i again give jeffrey sachs of harvard huge malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year three hundred to five hundred million cases are reported it 's estimated that africa loses about thirteen billion dollars a year to the disease five dollars can save a life we can send people to the moon we can see if there 's life on mars why can 't we get five dollar nets to five hundred million people the question though is not why can 't we the question is how can we help africans do this for themselves a lot of hurdles one production is too low two price is too high three this is a good road in in right near where our factory is located distribution is a nightmare but not impossible we started by making a loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in africa so that they could transfer technology from japan and build these here are just some pictures of the factory the company has employed another thousand women the throughput rate right now is one point five million nets three million by the end of the year we hope to have seven million so the production side is working on the distribution side though as a world we have a lot of work to do right now ninety five percent of these nets are being bought by the then given primarily to people around africa we 're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of africa people their women and so i want you to meet jacqueline my namesake twenty one years old if she were born anywhere else but tanzania i 'm telling you she could run wall street she runs two of the lines and has is creating an education fund and told me she is not and so when i told her about our idea that maybe we could take a tupperware model from the united states and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up we and quickly did a prototyping on this and she brought ten of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets five dollars apiece despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one and we learned a lot about how you sell things not coming in with our own notions because she didn 't even talk about malaria until the very end first she talked about comfort status beauty and not only is it beautiful but people can see status that you care about your children only then did she talk about saving a lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor"
