  "transcript": "to start this talk with a question to everyone people fight some battle oppressive governments others allow me to try to answer this question let me take you back two years ago he was five at the time after finishing his bedtime he looked at me and he asked a question mommy are we bad people i was shocked why do you say such things aboody he wouldn 't tell me what happened he was ready to tell two boys hit me today in school they told me ' we saw your mom on facebook you and your mom should be put in jail ' i 've never been afraid to tell aboody anything i 've been always a but those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth when it all came together i 'm a saudi woman just for giving me his car keys my own brother was detained twice leave the country with his wife and two year old son my father had to sit in a friday sermon listening to the imam condemning condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes amongst tons of worshippers some of them our friends and family of my own father i was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared gatherings in the streets and in schools they were just influenced by the adults around them and it wasn 't about me and it wasn 't a punishment for taking the wheel it was a punishment for daring to challenge but my story goes beyond this allow me to give you a briefing although i have a car and an international driver 's license but it 's been twenty years since anyone tried to do anything about it a whole generation ago he broke the good bad news in my face but there is no law banning you from driving it was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women we started receiving all these man wolves will rape you if you go and drive a courageous woman her name is najla hariri she 's a saudi woman in the city of jeddah she drove a car and she announced but she didn 't record a video so i drove i posted a video on youtube what happened next of course i started receiving threats to be killed raped just to stop this campaign the saudi authorities remained very quiet we wanted to know how the authorities so this time i asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car it went fast we were arrested signed a pledge not to drive again and i kept my abaya leaving today june seventeen comes the streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars hundred brave saudi women we broke the taboo but maybe few know why allow me to help you answer this question there was this official study that was presented to the shura council it 's the consultative council appointed by the king in saudi arabia he claims it 's done based on a unesco study and the illegitimate children prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don 't drive i know i was like this i was shocked i was like we are the last country in the world where women don 't drive so if you look at the map of the world that only leaves two countries saudi arabia and the other and it made headlines around the world customs that deal with women as if they are inferior and it becomes worse when it 's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law or the and they even fight those who try to it was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality of my person the villain back in my home country and the hero outside i 'm pretty sure when i was in jail everyone saw titles in the international media something like this it was a totally al sharif faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive i know al sharif withdraws from the campaign ah it 's okay this is my favorite al sharif breaks down and confesses ' foreign forces incited me ' and it goes on trial and flogging me in public i was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me and they looked at me as an inspiration at the same time i flew back to my home country the way they called it a betrayal to the saudi country and the saudi people and they even started a hashtag called # oslotraitor while the opposite hashtag so it 's these two totally different perceptions of my personality i 'm doing this because i believe a society will not be free if the women of that society are not free i learned to be always there and i 've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me i would listen to what they say and i would never defend myself with words only i filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver 's license there are a lot of people also very big support like those three thousand people who signed the petition to release me we sent a petition to the shura council in favor of lifting the ban on saudi women and there were like three thousand five hundred believed in that and they signed that petition and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views saudi arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women 's rights the shura council that 's appointed by the king by royal decree of king abdullah last year there were thirty women assigned to that council like twenty percent twenty percent of the council the same time finally that council after rejecting our petition four times for women driving they finally accepted it last february after being sent to jail or sentenced lashing or sent to a the grand mufti who is the head of the religious establishment in saudi arabia he said it 's not recommended for women to drive it so for me it 's not about only these 's about women themselves a friend once asked me she said so when do you think this women driving will happen i told her only if women stop asking ' when ' and take action to make it now so i have no clue really how i became an activist i will say i 'm proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban and celebrated everyone 's freedom so the question i started my talk with who do you think is more difficult to face oppressive governments or oppressive societies thank you everyone"
