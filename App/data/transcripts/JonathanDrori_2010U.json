  "transcript": "have two missions here today the first is to and to convince you that it 's more than just something that gets up your nose and secondly to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope is a flower 's way of making more flowers and it 's really rather better not to mate with yourself that 's probably true of humans as well mostly each anther can carry up to one hundred thousand grains here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen the little hole in the middle we 'll come to a bit later but that 's for the pollen tube to come out later on a very tiny tube so that 's twenty micrometers across that pollen grain there that 's about a 50th of a millimeter but not all pollen is quite so simple looking this is morina this is a who was an enterprising french gardener who issued the first seed catalog this is amazing i think that little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another morina flower just on the right species what happens like i said pollen carries the male sex cells if you actually didn 't realize that plants have sex they have rampant promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex really but about pollen itself so what are pollen 's properties i hear you ask yes we know that it 's also very biologically active as anyone with hay fever will understand now pollen from plants which are like trees and grasses and so on tend to cause the most hay fever and the reason for here are some examples they 're very smooth if you look at them of tree pollen that not really trying to attract insects this is a bee 's leg with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant and this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm very showy to attract lots of insects to do its bidding the pollen has little barbs on it if we look those little barbs obviously stick to the insects well but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this if it was the earth that tells me that it 's actually been fossilized this pollen and i 'm rather proud to say that this was found just near london and that fifty five million years ago london was full of mangroves isn 't that cool okay so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects you can tell that from the little barbs on there all these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope actually in the lab no coincidence that these were taken by rob kesseler who is an artist and i think it 's someone with a design and artistic eye like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen now all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and that 's actually quite handy if you so different species of plants grow in different places and this is where it gets interesting for forensics pollen is tiny it gets on to things and it sticks to them not only does each type of pollen look different but each habitat has a different combination of plants a different pollen signature if you like or a different pollen fingerprint by looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample you can tell very precisely where it came from now much of the pollen will still be there after repeated four very different habitats might look similar but they 've got very different pollen signatures but pollen forensics can be very subtle it 's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made where banknotes have come from to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did so you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs and finally in a rather grizzly way the bosnia war crimes some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen which showed that bodies had been buried exhumed and then reburied somewhere else"
