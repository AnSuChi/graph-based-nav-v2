  "transcript": "very nice to be here tonight so i 've been working on the history of income and wealth distribution for the past fifteen years and one of the interesting lessons historical evidence is indeed that in the long run there is a tendency for the rate of return of capital to exceed the higher the level of inequality so this is a key force that i 'm going to and there are many other forces that play an important role in the long run dynamics of income and wealth distribution also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected we know a little bit more today than we used to know but we still know too little and certainly there are many different processes economic social that need to be studied more and so i 'm going to focus today on this simple force but that doesn 't mean that other important forces do not exist so most of the data i 'm going to present comes from this database that 's available online the world top incomes database and this comes from the effort of over thirty scholars from several dozen countries so let me show you a couple of so fact number one is that there has been a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality between so back in one thousand nine hundred one thousand nine hundred and ten income inequality was actually the race between education and so you can see that one century ago it was between forty five and fifty percent in europe and a little bit above forty percent in the u s so there was more inequality in europe then there was a sharp decline during the first half of the 20th century and in the recent decade you can see that the u s has become more unequal than europe and this is the first fact i just talked about now the second fact is more about and also that although the total quantity of wealth relative to income has now recovered from the very large shocks caused by world war i the great depression world war so let me show you two graphs illustrating this is so wealth concentration was so remember for income inequality the share going to the top ten percent was between thirty and share is always between sixty and ninety percent okay so that 's fact number one and that 's very important for what follows wealth concentration is always a lot higher than income concentration fact number two is that the rise in in wealth inequality in recent decades is still not enough to get us back to one thousand nine hundred and ten so the where you had ninety percent in europe going to the top ten so today what you have is what i call the middle forty percent the people who are not in the top ten and who are not in the bottom fifty whereas they used to be poor a century ago when there was basically no wealth middle class so this is an important change and it 's interesting to see that wealth inequality has not fully recovered to has recovered okay so this is the total value of wealth relative to income and you can see that in particular in europe we are almost so there are really two different one has to do with the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate and there is nothing bad per se of course in accumulating a lot of wealth and in particular if it is so what we really want to and so let me come to some of the let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much then the level of wealth inequality should be more or less in line with the level of income inequality it will be very difficult to to explain why you have so much more wealth inequality than income inequality with a pure life cycle model so you need a story where people also care about wealth accumulation for other reasons so typically they want to transmit wealth to the next generation to their children or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth because of the prestige the power that goes with wealth so there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the data now in a large class of dynamic models of wealth accumulation with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth multiplicative shocks so for instance some families have a very large number of you also have shocks to rates of return some families make huge capital gains some made bad investments so you will always have some mobility in the wealth process some people will move up some people will move down the important point is that in any such model for a given variance of such shocks the equilibrium level of wealth inequality will be a steeply rising function of r minus g reason why the difference between the rate of return to wealth and the growth rate is important with r equals five percent and g equals one percent wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size assuming zero tax and you can just reinvest one fifth so of course some families so this allows and this was in a way very obvious to everybody for a simple reason which is that growth was close to zero percent whereas the rate of return on capital of course was not zero percent it was for land assets which was the traditional form of assets in preindustrial societies it was typically five percent you should have a capital value of twenty thousand r bigger than g was what allowed holders of wealth and assets to live off their capital income and to do something else something else in life than just to care about their own survival one important conclusion of my historical research is that modern industrial growth did not change this basic fact as much as one might have expected of course the growth rate following the industrial revolution rose typically from zero to one to two percent but at the same time the rate of return to capital also rose so that the gap between the two so during the 20th century you had a very unique combination of events first a bankruptcy during the great depression and all of this reduced the private rate of return to wealth to unusually low levels partly you know in germany in france in japan you had five percent growth rate between apparently that 's not going to last for very long or at least the population growth is supposed to decline in the future and the best projections we have growth is going to be closer to one to two percent rather than four to five percent so if you look at this these are the best estimates we have of world gdp growth and rate of return on capital average rates of return on capital so you can see that during most of the history of mankind and the process that brought growth to a smaller gap with the rate of return here i use the united nations population projections so of course they are uncertain it could be that we all start having a lot of children in the future and the growth rates are going to be higher but from now on these are the best projections we have and this will make global growth decline and gap between the other unusual destruction taxation of capital so this is the pre tax and this is what brought below the growth so let me say that the balance between returns on capital technology and the development of this would be a bigger share of the total capital stock that it is today well we are very far from this and from now what 's going on in the real estate sector the energy sector is much more important for the total capital stock and capital important issue is that there are scale effects in portfolio management together with financial complexity financial deregulation that make it easier to get higher rates of return for a large and this seems to be particularly strong for billionaires large capital endowments what could be done we know too little about and even wealth tax with a small tax rate will be a way to produce information so that then we can adapt our policies to whatever we observe and to some extent the fight against which it 's much easier to print money than to write a tax code so that 's very tempting but sometimes you don 't know what you do with the money this is a problem but this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics so but of course history history will invent its own best ways and it will probably involve a combination of all of these it 's impressive how you 're in command of your data of course but basically what you suggest is and if we leave it to its own devices it may threaten the system itself so you 're suggesting that we need to act to implement policies that redistribute wealth including the ones saw progressive taxation etc in the current political context how realistic are those how likely do you think that it is that they will be implemented thomas piketty look back through time the history of of income wealth and taxation is full of surprise so i am not terribly impressed by those who know in advance what will or will not happen i think one century ago and then suddenly it took a few u s sanctions against swiss banks for a big change to happen and now we are moving toward more financial transparency it 's not that difficult to better coordinate politically we are going to have a treaty with half of the world gdp around the table with the u s and the european union so if half of the world gdp is not enough to make progress on financial transparency and minimal tax for multinational so i think these are not technical difficulties i think we can we can make progress if we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions and we have the proper sanctions on those who benefit from financial opacity bg one of the arguments so we take measures to lower inequality and at the same time we lower growth potentially what do you answer to that tp yeah i think inequality is not a problem per se i think inequality up to a point can actually be useful for innovation and growth the problem is it 's a question of degree when inequality gets too extreme then it becomes useless for growth and it can even become bad because it tends to lead to high perpetuation of inequality over time and low the kind of wealth concentrations that we had in the 19th century and pretty much until world war i in every european country was i think not useful for growth this and also extreme inequality can be bad for our democratic institutions if it creates very unequal access to political voice and the influence of private money in so we don 't want to return to that kind of extreme pre world war i inequality having a decent share of the national wealth for the middle class is not bad for growth actually useful both for equity and efficiency reasons bg i said at the beginning that you have been accused of cherry picking data to make your case what do you answer to that tp well i answer that i am very happy that this book is stimulating debate this the reason why i put all the data online with all of the detailed computation is so that so i have responded point by point to every concern i would actually conclude that the rise in wealth inequality particularly in the united states has been actually higher than what i report in my book there is a recent study by saez with new data which i didn 't have at the time of the book that wealth look we put online almost every week new updated series on the world top income database and we will keep doing so in the future in particular in emerging and i welcome all of those who want to contribute to this data collection process in fact i certainly agree that there is not enough transparency about wealth dynamics and a good way to have better data would be to have a wealth tax with a small tax rate to begin with so that we can all agree about this important evolution and adapt our policies to whatever and that 's what we need the most right now"
