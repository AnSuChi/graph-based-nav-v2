  "transcript": "the vietnam vet marine who volunteered for three tours and got shot up in every one in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one he was medically retired because he had so much shrapnel in his body that he was setting off metal detectors for the next isolation depression now i became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering and for the past ten years my target has been the suffering caused by ptsd as experienced by veterans like carlos and so we didn 't know what to do and others still we simply said to them just go home and try to forget about your experiences more recently we 've tried therapy dogs wilderness retreats many things which may and i am here to tell you that we can now eliminate ptsd which treatments actually get rid of symptoms and which do not now making war this is something that we are good at we humans have been making war since before we were even fully human and since then we have gone from using stone and sinew to developing the most sophisticated and devastating weapon systems imaginable we employ the most cutting edge training methods we are good at making war and we are good at training our warriors to fight yet when we consider the experience of the modern day combat veteran we begin to see that we have not been as good at preparing them to come home why is that well our ancestors lived and they fought right where they lived so until only very recently in our evolutionary history there was hardly a need to learn how to come home from war because we never really did and when there is conflict in the united states now have the technology to put our warriors through advanced training drop them in to fight anywhere on the globe but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like i 've spoken with veterans who 've told me that one day they 're in a brutal firefight in afghanistan where they saw carnage and death and just three days later they found themselves toting an ice chest to their kid 's soccer game is the most common term it 's and that 's exactly what that is because while our warriors spend countless hours training for war we 've only recently come to understand that many require training on how to return to civilian life we don 't simply hand trainees mark 19 automatic grenade launchers and say here 's the trigger here 's some ammo and good luck no we train them on the range and in specific contexts over and over and over until lifting their weapon and engaging their target is so engrained into muscle memory that it can be performed without even thinking even under the most stressful conditions you can imagine now the same holds for training based treatments and this is a kind of mental recalibration when veterans come home from war their way of mentally framing the world is calibrated to an immensely more dangerous environment so when you try to overlay you begin drowning in worries about about dangers that aren 't present you begin not trusting family or friends which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life there are it 's just that the probability of encountering them compared to combat is astronomically lower so we never advise veterans to turn off caution completely we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are you turn it up we train veterans to be fiercely rational to systematically gauge the actual statistical probability of encountering recalibrations stick and so we started off by giving him exercises for him sitting with his back to the door and critically staying in these environments now at first he was very anxious he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands on a makeshift weapon and he wanted to leave but he didn 't and every time he did this his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit and then a little bit more and then a little bit more he had effectively relearned how to sit in a public space he also listened to recordings of his combat experiences over and over and over he listened until those memories no longer generated any anxiety and when i spoke with him this is the first time in that i haven 't had nightmares now this is different than erasing a memory veterans will always remember their traumatic experiences but with enough practice those memories are no longer as raw or as painful as they once were they don 't feel emotionally and that is an immensely better place to be but at the point of returning to civilian life you do not require somebody who 's been there you require training on how to come home for the past ten years of my work and it hasn 't always been easy there have been times where i have just felt my heart break but these training based treatments work so well that whatever this work takes out of me it puts back even more because i see people get better i see people 's lives transform carlos can now enjoy outings with his grandchildren which is something he couldn 't even do with his own children and what 's amazing to me is that after forty three years of suffering it only took him ten weeks of intense training to get his life back but at least now whatever days that i have left on this earth i can live them in peace he also said that these younger veterans don 't wait to get the help they need and that 's my hope too because this life is short and if you are fortunate enough and you shouldn 't wait to get the training you need to make that happen now the best way of ending human suffering caused by war the mental suffering that we create in our sons and in our daughters when we send them off to fight but we must ensure that the science the energy level the value that we place on sending them off to war is at the very least mirrored in how well we prepare them to come back home to us this much we owe them"
