  "transcript": "four years ago a security researcher or as most people would call it a hacker found a way to literally make atms throw money at him his name was barnaby jack technique barnaby jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or james bond villain but he chose to show the world his research instead he believed that sometimes and i feel the same way that 's why i 'm here today but the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all they just might be the immune system but they also find those hidden threats in our world and they make us i knew that i might get hacked for giving this talk because i 'm the one who looks like a boy standing to the side i was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the dungeons and dragons team wouldn 't let me join this is who i was but this but being a hacker that made her powerful and i wanted to be just like her so i started spending a lot of time on hacker chat i didn 't really know what it did but i it and used it anyway to get into a site like that open sesame it felt like this it 's geeks just like me but thankfully no and you all like to think that if we had such powers we would only use them for good but what if you could read your ex 's emails or add a couple zeros to your bank account and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world this is what happened last year when another security researcher called kyle lovett he learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers but they ignored his report perhaps they thought universal access was a feature not a your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world here 's what you should do to fix it we hope we helped making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure this is what and he found a serious privacy flaw on facebook these are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers due to some miscommunications his report was frustrated with the exchange he took to use his own discovery and they fixed the bug thankfully for khalil but i think there 's a greater story here still even companies founded by hackers like facebook it is going to take time and adapting because the alternative to blindly fight all these are things that will come back and bite you it is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web especially in times like like today even as governments and corporates fight to control the internet i find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace its last line of defense even perhaps someone like anonymous the leading brand of global hacktivism this universal hacker movement needs no introduction today but six years ago they were not much more than an internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and internet trolling campaigns their moment of transformation was in early two thousand and eight when the church of scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites it turns out the internet doesn 't like it when you try to remove things from it and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world from my hometown of tel aviv to this proved that anonymous and this idea since then and i think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or even leak sensitive documents i think that like but what they are after it 's your attention acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be they have been called many names from criminals to terrorists and i cannot justify but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all and if the internet doesn 't like it when you try to remove things from it just watch what happens when you try to shut the internet down this took place in egypt in january two thousand and eleven he sent his personal troops down to egypt 's internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country 's connection to the world overnight for a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented and for hackers made it personal but when the net went completely they found european service providers that still had analog dial up access infrastructure they opened up three hundred of those lines for egyptians to use serving slow but sweet internet connection for egyptians one guy even used it to download an episode of how i met your mother but while egypt 's future is still uncertain when the same thing happened in syria just one year later telecomix were prepared with those internet lines and anonymous they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the syrian military but with this sort of power because one man 's hero high profile targets in the past including the associated press 's twitter account in which they posted a a message but the resulting drop in the dow jones index that day was most certainly not this sort of thing is happening all over the world right now in conflicts from the crimean peninsula to latin america from europe to the united states political and military influence they come from all walks of life i might add they are now shaping the world 's stage this is because access to information is a critical currency of power one which governments would like to control a thing they attempt to do by setting up because the same people who demonize hacking i saw general keith alexander he 's the he was wearing jeans and a t shirt this was at def con the world 's largest hacker conference perhaps like me general alexander didn 't see twelve thousand criminals that day in vegas i think he saw untapped potential he was there to give a hiring pitch in this room right here he said is the talent our nation needs well hackers in the back row replied then stop arresting us but in light of what we know now who is more watchful of our online world the rules of the game are not that clear anymore but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data hoarding corporates on their own playing field to me that represents hope for the past three decades hackers have done a lot of things but they have also impacted civil liberties innovation and internet freedom because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys how can they be the heroes too my years in the hacker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty they just can 't see something broken in the world and leave it be they are compelled to either exploit it or try and change it and so they find the vulnerable aspects they force us to fix things or demand i think we need"
