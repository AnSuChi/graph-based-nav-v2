  "transcript": "and they were put up either by organizations who had teams to do it or by individuals who were really for the time and with the rise of social media and social networks in the early 2000s the web was completely changed to a place where now the vast majority of is not the only place you can do this but it 's the biggest and it serves to illustrate the numbers along with others that has allowed people which is unprecedented in history and as a computer scientist what this means is that i 've been able to build models that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes for all of you that you don 't even know you 're sharing information about so this is target the company i didn 't just put that logo on this poor pregnant woman 's belly you may have seen this anecdote that was printed in forbes magazine where target sent a flyer to this 15 year old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant yeah the dad was really upset he said how did target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents it turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers which is not just whether or not a woman 's pregnant but what her due date is but things like she bought more vitamins than she normally had or she bought a handbag that 's big enough to hold diapers and by themselves those purchases don 't seem like they might reveal a lot but it 's so in my lab and with colleagues we 've developed mechanisms where we can quite accurately predict things like your along with things like how much you trust the people you know and how strong those relationships are we can do all of this really well and again it doesn 't come from what you might think of as obvious information so my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the proceedings of the national academies if you google so just the things you like on facebook and used that to predict all these attributes along with some other ones and in their paper they listed the five likes that were most indicative of high intelligence and among those was liking a page for curly curly fries are delicious but liking them does not necessarily mean that you 're smarter than the average person so how is it that one of the strongest indicators of your intelligence is liking this page when the content is totally irrelevant to the attribute that 's being predicted and it turns out that we have to look at a whole bunch of underlying theories to see why we 're able to do this it turns out things like viral videos or facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way that diseases spread through so if i were to give you a hypothesis it would be that and so it spread to and they had smart friends and so it spread to them and so it propagated through the network so that by the end the action of liking the curly fries page is indicative of high intelligence not because of the content but because the actual action of liking reflects back the common attributes of other people who have done it so this is pretty complicated stuff right it 's a hard thing to sit down and explain to an average user and even if you do what can the average user do about it how do you know that you 've liked something that indicates a trait for you that 's totally irrelevant to the content of what you 've liked so i think there 's a couple paths that we want to look at if we want to give users some control over how this data is used because it 's not always going to be used for their benefit an example i often give is that if i ever get bored being a professor i 'm going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you 're a drug user if you 're an alcoholic we know how to predict all that and i 'm going to sell reports to h r companies and big businesses that want to hire you we totally can do that now i could start that business tomorrow and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that that seems to me to be a problem so one of the paths we can go down is the policy and law path and in some respects i think that that would be most effective but the problem is we 'd actually have to do it observing our political process in action makes me think it 's highly that we 're going to get a bunch of representatives to sit down learn about this and then enact sweeping changes to intellectual property law in the u s so users control their data we could go the policy route where social media companies say you know what you own your data you have total control over how it 's used the problem is that the revenue models for most social media companies rely on sharing or exploiting users ' data in some way it 's sometimes said of facebook that the users aren 't the customer so i think the other path that we can go down that 's going to be more effective is one of more science it and it 's actually very similar research that we 'd have to do by liking that facebook page or by sharing this piece of personal information you 've now improved my ability to predict whether or not you 're using drugs or whether or not you get along well in the workplace share something keep it private or just keep it offline altogether we can also look at things like but that select users who the the person who posted it want to see it have access to see it this is all super exciting research from an intellectual perspective and so scientists are going to be willing to do it so that gives us an advantage over the law side one of the and sometimes that involves inferring things about them and so i think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward as these tools evolve and advance means that we 're going to have an educated thank you"
