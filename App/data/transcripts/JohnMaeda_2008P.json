  "transcript": "basically it all began with this whole idea of a computer even a mobile phone it 's a computer and anyone remember this workbook you 'd buy that thing you plug it in and it would do absolutely nothing at all this was great it 's like they should make java books like this and we 've have no problem learning a program but this was a great grand time of the computer when it was just a raw raw what is it kind of an the torture was good wasn 't it good torture it was just life changing you know and so in my life you know i was in the tofu it was a family business and my mother was a kind of a designer also she 'd make this kind of like wall of tofu cooking and it would confuse the customers because they all and he would invent like ways to make things heavy like back here there 's like concrete block technology here and he would need the concrete blocks to slipped broke his arm rushed out safeway and because you see we 'd seen my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it but anyways the tofu to me was kind of my origin basically and so when i got to mit you know as most of you who are creatives your parents all told you not to be creative i went to mit did my math but i had this wonderful opportunity because computers had just become visual the apple and it was a time when a guy who kind of could cross the two sides it was a good time and so i remember that my first major piece of software was on a direct copy of i made a desktop publishing system way back when and that was kind of my first step into figuring out how to oh these two sides are kind of fun to mix and i was like yeah i 'm i had the fortune of going to something called a library and in the library i came upon this very book i found this book it 's called thoughts on design by a man named paul rand it 's a little slim volume i 'm not sure if you 've seen and when i saw this man 's or whatever i called it back then and i suddenly had a kind of career goal kind of in hot pursuit so i kind of switched i went to mit finished i got my masters and then went to art school after that and just began to design stuff like chopstick wrappers napkins menus whatever i could get a handle on and isn 't it that strange moment when you publish your design remember that moment publishing your designs and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer you know a crusty designer like a good kind of like a good french bread you know he wrote in one of his books a yale student and this to me was an important message from rand this is the first sort of play thing i did my own serious play i built a working version of it looks like illustrator it can like draw it was very hard to make this actually it took a month to make this part you can fly like a bird you 're free kind of thing so i could sort of change the and this is in they were saying make it stop now now i was saying well i it 's not like video it lasts forever it 's a very strange medium so i went off with this and began to look for things even more this is actually bad human experiments i would do these things where i 'd have students become pens there 's blue pen red pen green and he kind of messed up see humans don 't know how to take orders the computer 's so good at it this guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once you know you pen do this and you pen do this and so began to have we thought and after this i wanted to build a computer out of people called a a computer where the people are the parts i have behind this wall a disk drive a cpu a graphics card a memory system they 're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard and that little program 's on that cardboard disk she wears the disk and reads the data off the sectors of the disk and the computer starts up it sort of boots up really and it 's a sort of a working computer and when i built this computer i had a moment of what is it called the epiphany where i realized that the computer 's just so fast if you move the mouse it takes half an hour for the mouse cursor to change to give you a sense of the speed the scale the computer is just so amazingly fast o k this is something i did for sony so i began to experiment with industry in different ways with this kind of and chanel so getting to do different projects and also one thing i realized is that i like to make things we like to make things it 's fun to make things and so i have no staff it 's all kind of made by hand these sort of broken hands and these hands he 's the guy that kind of he was such an inspirational guy we 'd be in his studio like everything is okay and you 'd and he had a sudden situation with his he had an aneurysm how do you go it 's all these things all at once this is all at the same time the computer lives in so many dimensions and there were these like the computer lab you know and this is like in the late 1990s and i began to be fascinated by machines you know like copy machines and so this is actually in basel i noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive this is like a touch screen and i noticed how you can what is this thing in front of me this computer thing it didn 't make any sense so i began to make things again this is another series of objects made of old computers from my basement i made i took my old macintoshes and made different objects out of them from tokyo i began to be very disinterested in computers themselves so i began to make paintings out of palmpilots i made this series of i began to be fascinated by plastic so i spent four months making eight plastic blocks perfectly optically transparent as a kind of release of stress because of that i became interested in blue tape so in san francisco at c c i had a whole exhibition on blue tape i made a whole installation out of blue tape blue painters ' tape and at this point my wife kind of got worried about me so i stopped doing blue tape and began to think well what else is there in life and this is a series of light boxes i made for a show in italy very simple boxes you just press one button and some led interaction occurs series of lamps i made this is a bento box lamp it 's sort of a plastic rice lamp it 's very friendly i did a show in london last year made out of so i took sixteen ipod nanos and made a kind of there are all these things the thing i love the most is to experience taste the world the world is just so tasty we think we 'll go to a museum that 's where all the tastes are no they 're all out there so this is like in front of the eiffel tower really actually we all are creative people right this feeling 's a wonderful thing this is from the cape last year i discovered that i had to find the equation of art and design which we know as and i also discovered how and i went after it with passion but i discovered in the french word raison d 'tre i was like aha wait a and so i realized it was o k to go so i 'm going to risd actually risd wants to know what itself is and i have no idea what risd should be actually or what it wants to be but one thing i have to tell you is that although i 'm a technologist"
