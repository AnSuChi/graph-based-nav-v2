  "transcript": "that 's that i 'm a philosopher when i go to a party and people ask me what do i do and i say i 'm their eyes glaze over when i go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around they ask me what field i 'm in and i say philosophy their eyes glaze over when i go to a philosopher 's party and they ask me what i work on and i say consciousness their eyes don 't glaze over their lips curl into a snarl and i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think that 's impossible you can 't explain consciousness the very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question my late lamented friend bob they don 't accept the conclusion they die but in fact that doesn 't change people 's minds at all and i finally figured out the reason for that the reason for that is that everybody 's an expert on but they don 't consider themselves experts on video games they 've just got strong opinions i 'm sure that people here who work on say encounter people who have very strong opinions about i know all about this and so you tell them your theory i want to shake your confidence that you know authoritative about your own consciousness and this bark poodle you learn a lot about this man which reminds us as rod brooks was saying yesterday what we are what each of us is what you are what i am is approximately one hundred trillion little cellular robots that 's what we 're made of no other ingredients at all we 're just made of cells about one hundred trillion of them not a single one of those cells is conscious not a single one of those cells knows who you are or cares battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells not so different really from a bacterium each one of them the result how is that possible there can 't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness this is a lovely book by a friend of mine and he 's an expert magician and an expert on the street magic of india which is what this book is about net of magic and there 's a passage in it which i would love to share with you it speaks so eloquently to the problem i 'm writing a book on magic ' i explain and i 'm asked ' real magic ' not real magic ' ' real magic ' in other words refers to the magic that is not real while the magic a lot of people feel about consciousness if you 're going to explain this as a bag of tricks then it 's not real consciousness whatever it is and as other people consciousness is a bag of tricks this means that a lot of people are just left so this is the problem so i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won 't like for the same reason that you don 't like to see a magic trick explained to you if somebody some smart aleck starts telling you i 'd rather be mystified don 't tell me the answer and i 'm sorry if i impose some but i 'm not going to explain it all to you i 'm going to do what philosophers do here 's how a philosopher explains that 's not my department i 'm sorry but i 'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn 't quite as marvelous your own consciousness isn 't quite as wonderful as you may have thought it is this is something by the way that lee siegel talks about in his book he marvels at how he 'll do a magic show and afterwards people will swear they saw him do x y and z he never did those things he didn 't even try to do those things people 's memories inflate what they think they saw now let 's see if this will work all right let 's just watch this watch it carefully i 'm working with a young and this is a little demo that he 's done for me part of a larger project some of you may be interested in we 're looking for a backer ok now you all saw what changed right how many of you noticed that every one of those squares just show you by running it again even when you know that they 're all going to change color it 's very hard to notice you have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all this is an example one of many of a phenomenon that 's now being studied quite a bit it 's one that i predicted in in the last page or two of my consciousness explained where i said how can it be that there are all those changes going on and that we 're not aware of them earlier today jeff hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades the way your eye moves around three or four times a second he didn 't mention the speed your eye is constantly in motion moving around looking at eyes noses and where your eye isn 't looking you 're remarkably impoverished in your vision that 's because the foveal part of your eye which is the it doesn 't seem that way but that 's the way it is you 're getting in a lot less information than you think bellotto was a student of canaletto 's and i love paintings like that the painting is actually about as big as it is right here and i love canalettos because canaletto has this fantastic detail and you can and i started across the hall and i noticed that there 's a lot of people you can just barely see them walking across the bridge and i thought as i got closer i would be able to see all the detail of most people i yelled out because when i got closer i found the detail wasn 't there at all the artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things and my brain had taken the suggestion you 're familiar with a more you can get a better view of the blobs see when you get close they 're really just just blobs of paint you will have seen something like this this is the reverse effect i 'll what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion when an artful blob of paint or two by an artist suggests one of i don 't think so the brain isn 't actually putting the detail let 's just do this experiment very quickly is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right rotated how do you know that 's what you did there 's in fact been a very interesting but the the details of the process are still and if you read that literature one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is this is a figure that i love bradley petrie and dumais you may think that i 've cheated that i 've put a little can you the boundary that goes right there there 's another way of seeing it as a cube on a black background as seen through a piece of swiss cheese can you get it how many of you can 't get it that 'll help when you see the cube one way behind the screen but there 's still a sort of filling in as we can tell if we look at this we don 't have any trouble seeing the cube but where does the color change does your brain have to send little painters in there the purple painters and the green painters fight over who 's going to paint that bit behind the curtain no your brain just lets it go the brain doesn 't need to fill that in when i first started talking about the bradley petrie dumais example that you just saw i 'll go back to it this one i said that there was no filling in but rob van lier has recently shown that it isn 't look in the gray areas and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there yeah it 's amazing there 's nothing there it 's no trick this is ron rensink 's work which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book let me just pause this for a second if i can this is change blindness what you 're going to see is two pictures and this will just continue and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change so blank and keep going until the subject presses the button saying i see the change so now we 're going to be subjects in the experiment we 're going to start easy some examples no trouble there can everybody see took only a little bit more than a second to press the button can you see that one two point nine seconds how many don 't see it still what 's on the roof of that barn is it a bridge or a dock are particularly striking this one because it 's so large and yet it 's pretty hard to see seconds is the median time for how many still don 't see it how many engines on the wing of that boeing right in the middle of the picture using their methods can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of and that in fact you 're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are and we 're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind jeff hawkins this morning was describing his attempt to get theory and a good big theory into the neuroscience and he 's right this is a problem harvard medical school once i was at a talk director of the lab said in our lab we have a saying that 's neuroscience that 's psychology we have to have more theory and it can come as much from the top down thank you very much"
