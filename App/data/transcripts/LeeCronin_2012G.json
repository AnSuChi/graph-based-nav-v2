  "transcript": "and as a chemist one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is could we make a really cool universal well to start to do this we took a 3d printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine so if you have a a cell that 's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill if you have this embedded in your device at the same time and so the really cool bit is the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer and you download the blueprint the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it because if we can manufacture it after we 've discovered it we could deploy it anywhere you don 't need to go to the chemist anymore we can print drugs at point of need so this allows you on the fly well beam me up scotty"
