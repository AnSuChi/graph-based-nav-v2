  "transcript": "but i 'm a big fan of the concrete block the first concrete blocks were manufactured in one thousand eight hundred and sixty eight with a very simple idea modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit very quickly concrete blocks became the most used construction unit in the world one brick at a time almost a hundred years later in lego came up with this it was called the automatic binding brick and in a few short years lego bricks took place in every household it 's estimated that over four hundred billion bricks have been produced or seventy five bricks for every person on the planet meanwhile the exact same year at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced the next building block but there 's a main difference the transistor was only for i personally don 't accept this that the building block of our time is reserved for experts so i decided to change that eight years ago when i was at the media lab i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers a few years ago i started developing littlebits let me show you how they work littlebits are electronic modules with each one specific function sound motors and sensors and the best part about it is they snap together so you can 't put them the wrong way the bricks are color coded green is output blue is power so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making making larger circuits you can put a knob in between and now you 've made a little dimmer which is here and now you 've made a little blinker add this buzzer for some extra punch so beyond instead of having to program to wire to solder littlebits allow you to program using very we 've been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them and it 's been an incredible here you see with felt and paper a few weeks ago we took littlebits to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever just cardboard wood and paper and told them make something motion activated confetti canon ball this is actually my favorite project it 's a lobster made of playdough that 's afraid of the dark so littlebits is open source you can go on the website download all the design files make them yourself we want to encourage a world of creators thank you"
