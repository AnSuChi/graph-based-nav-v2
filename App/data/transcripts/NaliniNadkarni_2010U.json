  "transcript": "and i decided to i waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas and that produced art the piece of art you see on your left is and what i learned was that different species have different signatures i multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes and so i was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year and so simply by shifting the united states has over two point three million incarcerated men and women that number is rising funds for education for training and for rehabilitation are declining so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues and i think the answer is yes the year two thousand and seven i started a partnership with the washington state department of corrections working with four prisons we began bringing science we give science lectures and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state and just recently we 've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities they 've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners they 're kept in bare cells like this for twenty three hours a day when they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals they 're placed in immobile booths like this for one hour a day they 're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards putting them on the walls so at least they get contact with visual images of nature less apt to collective movements of change can perhaps move we know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs then perhaps there are other static entities like racism that can also change thank you very much"
