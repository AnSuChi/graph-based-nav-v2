  "transcript": "this is the realm of the coast redwood tree its species name is sequoia sempervirens sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on earth the range of the species goes up to as much as three hundred and eighty feet tall that 's thirty eight stories tall these are trees that would stand out in midtown manhattan nobody knows how old the oldest living coast redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any but it 's believed that the oldest living redwoods are perhaps two thousand five hundred years old roughly the age of the parthenon the north coast of california where the rain is really intense in recent historic times about ninety six percent of the coast redwood forest was cut down especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging clear cutting that took place in the wild and now protected but curiously the fragments that we have left to this day remain redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through i 'm going to ask you to imagine what a redwood really is as a living organism and chris if i could have you up i have a tape measure and chris if you could take the end of that tape measure we 're going to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big redwood is unfortunately this tape isn 't long enough it 's only and maybe about here about thirty feet is the diameter of a big redwood redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time and yet redwoods are constantly in motion wait two thousand years and you get this the lost monarch it dwells in the grove of you 're not seeing the organism you 're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant and most of the organism is overhead unseen i became very interested and i wrote about a couple steve sillett and marie antoine are the principal explorers of the redwood forest canopy also are world class forest ecology scientists steve sillett when he was a 19 year old college student at reed college had heard that the redwood forest canopy is considered to be a so called redwood desert that is to say at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of redwood trees and with a friend of his he took it upon himself to free climb a redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there he climbed up a small tree next to this giant redwood and then and then from there he climbed directly up the bark his friend a guy named marwood neither one of them had noticed that there was a yellow jacket wasp 's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that steve had jumped into and when marwood made the jump he was covered with wasps stinging him in the face and eyes he nearly let go and what they found was not a redwood desert but a lost world a kind of three dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with unknown life now i had been working on other topics the emergence of infectious diseases after three books on this it got to be a bit much in a way my wife and i adore our i began climbing trees with my kids as children are incredibly adept at climbing trees that 's my son oliver they don 't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do if ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest humans appear to be the only primates that i know of that are afraid of heights all other primates when they 're scared they run up a tree where they feel safe we camped overnight in the trees in tree boats this is my daughter laura then fifteen looking out of a tree boat she 's by the way tied in with a rope so she can 't fall and we practiced advanced techniques like sky walking where you can move from which gets over a branch in the tree and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line which is thought to be one of the oldest redwoods there they are they are but then you enter the redwood canopy and and you 're in a three dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil which is populated with all kinds of small organisms it 's like scuba diving into a coral reef and then the trees tend to flare out into platform like areas at the top maria 's sitting on one of them these limbs could be five to six hundred years old redwoods grow very slowly in their tops they also have a feature thickets of huckleberry bushes that grow out of the tops of redwood trees that are technically known as huckleberry and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you 're resting redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration and as they put out limbs the limbs burst into small trees copies of the redwood now here we see a reiteration in one of the older redwoods this reiteration is a huge flying buttress that comes out the tree itself this buttress is less than halfway up the tree and then it bursts into a forest of redwoods this particular extra trunk and yet it 's only marie antoine and their colleagues gives you an idea what you 're seeing here is a hierarchical to give a sense of scale there 's the person right there the person is waving to us i 've wanted to ask craig venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to and if we were able to reiterate then the fingers of our hand would be people and they would have people on their hands and so on and if we had redwood like biology we would have six layers of people on our hands as it were and it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time laughter to reiterate the point and this hallucinatory drawing shows you everything you see in this drawing is iluvatar these are millennial structures portions of the tree that are believed to be more than one thousand years old there are four humans in this shot one two and there 's also something that i want to show you this is a flying buttress redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk going back into the main trunk and fusing with it wired them like patients in they 're finding out that redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks possibly all the way into their root systems they also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself if a portion of a redwood is rotting the redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just you know extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep and there are organisms in this soil that have as yet no names this is an unnamed species of a copepod is a crustacean these copepods are a major constituent or how they got there is completely unknown there are some interesting theories that if i had time i would tell you about but as you go and you look closer at a tree what you see is you see increasing complexity 're looking at the very top of gaya this little japanese garden like creation as you look at a tree and we 're moving in a full circle now in the when it moved into and the new tree had no resistance to it the eastern hemlock forest is being considered in some i hadn 't even known that there were rainforests in the east but in great smoky mountains national park it can rain up to one hundred inches of rain a year and in the last two to three summers these invasive organisms this kind of ebola of the trees as it were has swept through the primeval hemlock forest of and has absolutely wiped it out and what we 're seeing is not just the potential death of the eastern hemlock species that is to say its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite but we 're also seeing the death for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns it 's absolutely heartbreaking to see one of the things that is just i almost can 't conceive it is the idea that the national news media hasn 't picked this up at all and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in north america the flickering transitory quality of human time but we 're different from trees and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have we are human and we have the capacity to love we have the capacity to wonder and we have a sort of boundless curiosity a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates i think exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on earth and i think that one of the happiest things is the sense that that with my children i 've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans who thank you very much it was nathan myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like two thousand years and older on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the earth except on that one i mentioned hyperion the world 's tallest tree marie antoine and we wondered whether this ant this species of ant was only endemic to that one tree and in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again and so no specimens have ever been collected we don 't know what it is we just know it 's there ca if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on earth you know our stories are about iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip you 've just told us a different story of this this tragic arms race that 's happening and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever it and a sense of just how fragile this this whole thing is rp it is fragile and you know i think about emerging human diseases parasites that move into the human species but that 's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species inadvertently rp caused by humans caused by the movement of humans and the continents are rooms in the palace and the islands are small rooms the doors of the palace have been flung open and the walls are coming down ca richard preston thank you very much i think"
