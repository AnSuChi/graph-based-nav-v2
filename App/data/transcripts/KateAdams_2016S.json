  "transcript": "tina lord found herself in quite the pickle see this gold digger made sure she married sweet cord roberts just before he inherited millions but when cord found out tina loved his money as much as she loved him he dumped her cord 's mother maria was thrilled until so tina still married but thinking cord didn 't love her flew to argentina with max cord finally figured out what was going on and rushed after them but he was too late tina had already been kidnapped strapped to a raft and sent over a waterfall she and her baby were presumed dead cord was sad for a bit but then he bounced right back with a seemingly back from the dead ran into the church holding a baby ladies and gentlemen is how the soap opera one life to live introduced a love story that lasted but i believe the opposite to be true so there are real life lessons we can learn from soap operas and those lessons are as big and adventurous as any soap opera storyline now i 've been a fan since i ran home from the bus stop in second grade desperate to catch the end of luke and laura 's wedding the biggest moment in general hospital history so you reading soap opera scripts and auditioning actors to be on and yes soap operas are larger than life drama on a grand scale but our lives can be filled with as much intensity and the stakes can feel just as dramatic we cycle through tragedy and joy just like these characters we cross thresholds fight demons and find which means we can learn from these characters that move looping and swerving through life and we can use those lessons to craft our own life stories so with that let 's start with soap opera lesson one surrender is not an option all my children ' s erica kane was daytime 's version of scarlett o 'hara a hyperbolically self important princess who deep down was scrappy and daring on tv perhaps erica 's most famous scene is her alone in the woods suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear she screamed at the bear i am erica kane and you are a filthy beast so what that teaches us is obstacles are to be expected and we can choose to surrender pandora is when you believe maybe it 's even an admission that we 're not as special as we might like to think and she made sure valley girl brooke knew it but after nearly twenty five years of epic fighting stephanie got sick and let brooke in archenemies became soul mates and stephanie died in brooke 's arms and here 's our takeaway drop your ego life is not about you it 's about us and our ability to experience joy and love and to improve our reality comes only when we make ourselves vulnerable and we accept responsibility for our actions and our inactions kind of like howard schultz the ceo of starbucks now after a great run as ceo howard stepped down in two thousand and starbucks quickly overextended itself and stock prices fell howard rejoined the team in two thousand and eight and one of the first things he did and then he asked for help starbucks has more than doubled its net revenue since howard came back so sacrifice your desire to be right or safe all the time it 's not helping anyone least of all you sacrifice your ego soap opera lesson three evolution is real you 're not meant to be static characters on television static equals boring and boring equals fired characters are supposed to grow and change recasting happens all the time on soaps over the last twenty years four different actors have played the same key role of carly benson on general hospital now there was always an essential nugget of carly in there while we may not swap faces in our own lives we can evolve too we can choose to draw a circle around our feet and stay in that spot or we can open ourselves to opportunities like carly who went from nursing student to hotel owner and when the war ended she got married moved to france and decided to give culinary school a shot julia her books and her tv shows revolutionized the way america cooks we all have the power to initiate change in our lives to evolve and adapt but sometimes life chooses for us and we don 't get a heads up surprise slams us in the face you 're flat on the ground the air is died of a stroke but not really because in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four he died when his car plunged into the harbor and yet he was back in and so it went for thirty years we knew better he 's called the phoenix for a reason and here 's what that means for us as long as the show is still on the air or you 're still breathing now of course just like life soap operas do ultimately meet the big finale cbs canceled my show as the world turns in december two thousand and nine and we shot our final episode in june two thousand and ten and even though we were in the middle of a huge recession and millions of people were struggling to find work so i packed up the kids and the brooklyn apartment and we moved in with my in laws in and that 's enough to make anyone feel dead inside but i knew my story wasn 't over that it couldn 't be over i just had to tap into everything i i had to be adaptable like carly and evolve my skills my eventually i got an interview i had an offer for an entry level job was thirty seven years old and i was back from the dead kind of like tina but they got remarried three times before the show went off the air in it 's never too late to change your story thank you"
