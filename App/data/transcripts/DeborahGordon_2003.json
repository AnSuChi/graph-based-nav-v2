  "transcript": "and that 's because i like to think about how organizations work how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization the web is one there are many biological systems like that brains cells developing embryos there are about ten thousand species of ants they all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers and all ant colonies have in common that there 's no central control nobody tells anybody what to do and i 've been working for the past twenty years on a population of seed eating ants in southeastern arizona here 's my study site this is really a picture of ants and the rabbit just happens to be there and these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds this is the and it 's not very big and i go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before and by doing this i know how old they all are and because of that i 've been able to study how their behavior changes so i want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony and they do that by each year sending out the reproductives those are the ones with wings on a mating flight so every year on the same day and it 's a mystery exactly how that happens and they mate and this shows a recently virgin queen here 's her wings and she 's in the process and there 's another male on top waiting his turn often the queens mate more than once and after that the males all die that 's it for them continuing to lay eggs using the sperm from that original mating she feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves they make a midden a pile of refuse mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat and then this is how colony size and numbers of worker and it stays that size until the queen dies and there 's nobody to make more ants when she 's about fifteen or twenty years old in numbers of ants that they start to reproduce that is to send more winged and i know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because i 've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants so although it 's interesting question that i think about with these ants is what i call task allocation that 's not just how is the colony organized but how does it change what it 's doing how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change so things happen to an ant colony there 's a lot of damage to the nest and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess when extra food becomes available and this is what everybody knows about picnics then extra ants are allocated to collect the food so with nobody telling anybody what to do how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task and that 's the process that i call task allocation searching they somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go and by coming back just by making it back they tell the foragers that it 's safe to go out then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest and i wanted to say that the nests look a lot like bill lishman 's house that is that there are chambers inside they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe like surface in it inside the nest and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles so you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand put it down turn around and go back in and finally the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage so what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse on one day it 'll all be here and then the next day they 'll move it over there and then they 'll move it back and these four groups are just the ants outside the nest so that 's only about twenty five percent of the colony and they 're the oldest ants so an ant starts out somewhere near the queen and when we dig up nests we find they 're about as deep as the colony is wide so about a meter deep i don 't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes but instead because when there 's flooding occasionally she just lays there 's the larvae and they consume most of the food and this is true of most ants that the ants you see walking around they just drop it into the upper chamber and other ants come up from below get the food bring it back husk the seeds and pile them up there are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest and they might all come out if they were needed in fact mostly they 're just hanging around in there and i think it 's a very interesting question what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing and they sort of stand as a as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside and if you mark ants and dig up a colony you never see them deep down so what 's happening is that the ants work they never go back down but they mostly work by so just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn 't true you know even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do so that 's one way that we know the queen isn 't directing the behavior of the colony so when i first set out to work on task allocation my first question was what 's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing and i was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others knowing its place on the assembly line and instead i wanted to ask how are the different task groups interdependent this is what it looks like about twenty minutes later about forty minutes later and the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there and what i wanted to know was ok here 's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks then we and lately we 've gotten more sophisticated we have this three color system and we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which we started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers and and so just to summarize the result well it turns out that yes the different tasks are interdependent so if i change the numbers performing one task so for example if i put out extra food everybody else the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food they become foragers the nest maintenance workers become foragers the patrollers become foragers and this shows how it works like i just said if there is more food to collect the patrollers the midden workers the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage so extra patrollers were needed the nest maintenance workers will switch to but if more nest maintenance work is needed for example if i put out a bunch of toothpicks so foraging acts as and finally it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not so for example when there 's extra nest maintenance work to do it 's not that the foragers switch over i know they don 't do that but the foragers somehow decide not to come out and here was the most intriguing result the task allocation this process changes with colony age and it changes like this when i do these experiments with older colonies so ones that are five years or older the more they act like undisturbed colonies whereas the young and the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year it instead something about the organization must be i 've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kinds of decision rules very simple local probably olfactory chemical rules could an ant could be using ant can assess the global situation and what i 've found out is that ants are using when one ant touches another it 's smelling and it can tell for example whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants and so what the message is is not any but the pattern the pattern itself is the message and i 'll tell you a little bit more about that but if instead i start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers i 'm less likely to forage so it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker and we 've learned that in this species and i suspect in others as well these hydrocarbons this layer of grease on the outside of ants is different and we 've done experiments that show that that 's because the longer an ant stays outside the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface and we 've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate and it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon so i want now to show you a bit of film and this will start out first of all they 've gone out to do different tasks the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines or influences each ant 's decision about whether to go out and which task to perform this is taken through a fiber optics microscope it 's down inside the nest but the idea is that the ants are in there and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants and the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out and what it does when it comes back out you can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these each and the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip are contacting the ants coming in it 's variable it 's noisy the first is that the experience of the ant of each ant can 't be very predictable because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen and the second thing is that an ant 's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting so we do a lot of simulation and modeling and also experimental work to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to in the again i don 't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork in fact if you watch ants at all you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it so it 's not really that out of these haphazard contacts something that they 're doing is clearly successful enough produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants and one of the things that we 're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns this network of interaction patterns to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies so the one the simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule like i expect to meet another forager every three seconds but in a small it 's likely to meet fewer foragers just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet so this is the kind of rule that as the colony develops and gets older and larger will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one"
