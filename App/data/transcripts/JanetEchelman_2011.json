  "transcript": "i 'm using it to create permanent billowing voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world i was an unlikely person to be doing this i never studied sculpture engineering or architecture in fact after college i applied to seven art schools i went off on my own to become an artist and i painted for ten years when i was offered a fulbright to india promising to give exhibitions of paintings i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram the deadline for the show arrived my paints didn 't but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive but this time i saw it differently a new approach to sculpture a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials my first satisfying sculpture was made i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans next in lithuania but i wanted to make them larger to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in we made a net of a million and a half thousands of people saw it sola morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto portugal durable those are in opposition to idiosyncratic delicate and ephemeral for two years i searched for a fiber pollution and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic he helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape i couldn 't build this the way i knew because hand tied knots weren 't going to withstand a hurricane learned the variables of their machines and figured out a way to make lace with three years and two children later we raised this lace net it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built permanent and had lost nothing in translation this intersection had been bland and anonymous i walked underneath it for the first time i felt sheltered and at the same time connected to limitless sky my life was not going to be the same i 'm going to share historic philadelphia city hall so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet i 'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time next challenge the biennial of the americas in denver asked could i represent the thirty five nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture i read about the recent earthquake in chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean sped up the planet 's rotation and literally shortened so i contacted noaa and i asked if they 'd share their data on the tsunami and translated it into this its shape was too complex now so i replaced the metal armature with a soft fine mesh of a fiber fifteen times stronger than steel which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings literally becoming part of the fabric of the city so we had to create it then i got a call from new york city asking if i could adapt these concepts to times square or the high line this new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers they don 't have funding yet i searched for beauty in the traditional things in craft forms materials and engineering to create voluptuous billowing forms the scale of buildings my artistic horizons continue to grow i 'll leave you with this story i got a call from a friend in phoenix dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture there they were in their business suits laying in the grass noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn 't know thank you"
