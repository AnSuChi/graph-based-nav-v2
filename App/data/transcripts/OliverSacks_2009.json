  "transcript": "and we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination our inscapes we 've lived with them all our lives so i am going to be talking and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients a few months ago i got a phone call and they wondered if she 'd gone because she was an old lady whether she 'd had a stroke or whether she had alzheimer 's and so it was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid but she 'd been very told me the nurses hadn 't mentioned this that she was blind so i said what sort of things and she said people in eastern dress in drapes walking up and down stairs but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth animals too dragging the snow away the scene they come to a certain point and then stop rose and blue like eastern dress before the people come on she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor which seem to go up to the ceiling this like a dream and she said no it 's not like a dream it 's like a movie she said it 's got color it 's got motion but it 's completely silent she said all these people with eastern dress walking up and down very repetitive very limited but she was frightened she 'd lived ninety five years and she 'd never had a hallucination before she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was she had no control over them she said she didn 't recognize any of the people or places in well i examined her carefully she was a bright old lady she wasn 't on any medications which could produce hallucinations and i then said to her i think i know what you have i said there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness by and you have charles bonnet syndrome nothing wrong with your brain there is nothing wrong with your mind you have charles bonnet syndrome and she said who is this charles bonnet she said did he have them himself not crazy i 'm not demented i have charles bonnet syndrome largely i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired about ten percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations you don 't have to be completely blind only sufficiently impaired now with the original description in the 18th century charles bonnet did not have them his grandfather had these hallucinations his grandfather was a magistrate had cataract surgery and in one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine he described to his grandson various things he was seeing and then he saw a big wheel in midair but sometimes he wasn 't sure whether he was hallucinating or not because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions so on one occasion when his granddaughters were visiting them he said and who are these handsome young men with you there are no handsome young men and then the handsome young men disappeared and they change suddenly charles lullin the grandfather saw hundreds of different figures different landscapes of all sorts on one and realized it was himself that was the only figure he recognized on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris he saw this was real a scaffolding but when he got back home he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high on his study table this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia what seems to be going on and rosalie said what 's going on and i said that as you lose vision as the visual with another patient of mine who also had some vision the vision she had could be disturbing on one occasion she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant and he turned around and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads she had very he was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when when the car turned and then when they came to a stop the and then disappear another patient of mine but the visual parts of her brain a little tumor in the occipital cortex these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen and especially she saw cartoons of kermit the frog but she made a point of saying why kermit she said kermit the frog means nothing to me why kermit kermit the frog means nothing to me she didn 't mind the cartoons too much but what did disturb her was she got very persistent the faces were often deformed with very well what is going on with these people as a physician i have to try and define what 's going on and to reassure people especially to reassure them that they 're not going insane something like ten percent as i said of visually impaired people get these because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed in particular the notion is that if you see things or hear things you 're going mad but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different they address you they accuse you they seduce you they humiliate you they jeer at you you interact with them you 're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you or that 's how people think about it and sometimes if one has this one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place you smell chestnuts roasting you hear the traffic all the senses are involved located in space and time coherent dramatic so in the you have all sorts of levels from the geometrical hallucinations the pink and blue squares the woman had up to quite elaborate hallucinations with fascinatingly in the last few years it 's been possible to do and in fact to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating when people have these simple geometrical hallucinations the primary visual cortex is activated this is the part of the brain which perceives edges and you don 't form images with your primary visual cortex when images are formed a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe and it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus they maybe lose the ability to recognize there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the the deformed there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons it it 's very interesting that that should be specific there are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes so you may not only have car cells you may have aston martin cells laughter now at this level in what 's called the inferotemporal cortex there are only visual images or figments or fragments it 's only at higher levels and in the charles bonnet syndrome don 't go to those higher levels you 're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images it is only if one is visually impaired or blind suddenly this this and suddenly that the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this but in fact people say i don 't recognize the people i can 't form any kermit means nothing to me you don 't get anywhere i 've more or less said what i i think i just but so this sort of thing needs to be brought into i think they are for giving one some insight as to how the brain works charles bonnet said two hundred and fifty years ago he wondered how thinking these hallucinations how as he put it the theater of the mind could be generated thanks very much i was afraid you 'd ask that but they stop there ca and they don 't disturb they occasionally interest me and i have many pictures of them i 've gone and had an fmri myself to see how my visual cortex is taking over i wonder whether everyone sees things like this and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit ca that was an utterly utterly fascinating talk thank you so much for sharing"
