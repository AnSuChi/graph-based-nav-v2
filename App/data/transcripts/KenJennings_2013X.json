  "transcript": "two weeks time that 's the ninth anniversary of the day i first stepped out onto that hallowed jeopardy set i mean nine years is a long time and given jeopardy 's average demographics i think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead all a few are still alive occasionally i still get recognized at the mall or whatever and when i do it 's as a bit of a know it all i think that ship has sailed it 's too late for me for better or for worse that 's what i 'm going to be known as as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff and i can 't complain about this i feel like that was always sort of my destiny although i had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet if nothing else you realize very quickly as a it 's all there i was the kind of kid who was always bugging mom and dad with whatever great fact i had just read about haley 's comet or giant squids or the size of the world 's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was i now have a and i loved game shows fascinated with game shows i remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine because it had just hit me as badly as i wanted to go to school that i was also going to miss hollywood squares and that 's what you were watching so me and all my friends would run home every day and watch jeopardy i was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid i remember being able to play trivial pursuit against my parents back in the ' 80s and holding my own back when that was a fad there 's a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that mom and dad don 't know you know some beatles factoid that dad didn 't know and you think that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex game show contestant and i became a computer programmer not an especially good one not an especially happy one at but that 's what i was doing and it made it doubly ironic my computer background a few years later i think two thousand and nine or so when i got another phone call from jeopardy saying it 's early days yet but ibm tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at ' jeopardy ' are you up for this course i said yes for several reasons one because playing jeopardy is a great time it 's fun it 's the most fun you can have with your pants on but i would i would go back and play for arby 's coupons i just love jeopardy and i always have and second of all because a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future people playing computers on game shows the third reason i said yes is because i was pretty confident that i was going to win i had taken some artificial intelligence classes i knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on jeopardy people don 't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can unpack the meaning of the clue the kind of thing that a human little kid could do very hard for a computer and i thought well this is going to be child 's play yes i will come destroy the computer and defend defend my species laughter started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this i started to get occasional updates from them and i started to get a little more worried i remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph it was a scatter chart showing performance on jeopardy tens of thousands of dots representing jeopardy champions up at the top with their performance plotted on number of clues responded to and i noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots the black dots in the upper right represent 74 time ' jeopardy ' champion ken jennings and i saw this line coming for me and i realized this is it this is what it looks like when the future comes for you it 's not the the terminator 's gun sight it 's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do the only thing that makes you special the thing you 're best at it was very different than the jeopardy games i 'd been used to we were not playing in l a on the regular jeopardy set watson it 's thousands of processors a terabyte of memory trillions of bytes of memory we got to walk through his climate controlled server room and you must make the pilgrimage so me and the other human player wound up at this secret ibm research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in westchester county to play the computer and we realized right away that the computer had a big home court advantage there was a big watson logo in the middle of the stage like you 're going to play the chicago bulls and there 's the thing in the middle of their court and the crowd was full of v p s and programmers cheering on their little darling having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up and holding up go watson signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right written on their bellies in grease paint if you can imagine computer programmers they were exactly right i don 't want to spoil it if you still have this sitting on your dvr but watson won handily and i remember standing there behind the podium as i could hear that little insectoid a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer and you could hear that little tick tick tick tick and i remember thinking i felt like a detroit factory worker of the ' 80s seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line i felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime and it hasn 't been the last if you watch the news you 'll see occasionally and i see this all the time that pharmacists now there 's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist and a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals because there 's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions you don 't need human assistants for that anymore i read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score from a baseball or football game and and obviously these new technologies can 't so as a result of these new technologies we 'll enter a new golden age of leisure time for the things we really love because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by watson and his digital i 've heard other people say quite the opposite that this is yet another tier of the middle class that 's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous something that we should worry about i 'm not an economist myself all i know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work it was terrible here 's the one thing that i was ever good at and all it took was ibm pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and i 'm sorry ken we don 't need you anymore start outsourcing i have read that there 's now actually evidence that the hippocampus the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like gps and it made me think what happens when computers are now better at knowing and remembering stuff than we are is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less as somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know this was a terrifying idea to the more i thought about it i realized no the things we know are still important i came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says oh yeah i can google that hold on a second there 's an advantage of volume and there 's an advantage of time the advantage of volume first just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays there 's so much information out there being a renaissance man or woman that 's something that was only possible in the renaissance now it 's really not possible to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor there 's just too much they say that the scope of human information is now doubling every eighteen months or so the sum total of human information that means between now and late two thousand and fourteen we will generate as much information in terms of gigabytes as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together it 's doubling every eighteen months now this is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts like where do i go to school what should i major in who do i vote for do i take this job or that one these are the decisions that require correct judgments about many different kinds of facts if we have those facts at our mental fingertips we 're going to be able to make informed decisions if on the other hand we need to look them all up we may be in trouble according to a national geographic survey i just saw somewhere along the lines of eighty percent of the people who vote in a u s presidential election about issues like foreign policy if you can 't do that first step are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you 're going to need to know to master your knowledge of u s foreign policy quite probably not at some point you 're just going to be like you know what there 's too much to make a less informed decision the other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips i always think of the story of a little girl named tilly smith she was 10 year old girl from surrey england on vacation with her parents a few years ago in phuket thailand she runs up to them on the beach one morning and says mom dad we 've got to get off the beach and they say what do you mean we just got here and she said kearney 's geography class last month he told us and you need to clear the beach and they finally to their credit decided to believe her they told the lifeguard they went back to the hotel and the lifeguard cleared over one hundred people off the beach luckily because that was the day of the boxing day that killed thousands of people in southeast asia and around the indian ocean but not on that beach not on mai khao beach because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before now when when facts come in handy like that i love that story because it shows you the power of one fact one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time normally something that 's easier to see on game shows than in real life but in this case it happened in real life and it happens in real life all the it 's not always a tsunami often it 's a social situation it 's a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge you say where you 're from and i and i know just a little something about it enough to get the ball rolling people love that shared connection that gets created when when that 's often the advantage of time and it 's not effective if you say well hold on you 're from fargo north dakota let me that 's just annoying samuel parr once said it 's always better to know a thing than not to know it it 's probably that i have always believed that the things we know that knowledge is an absolute good that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are as individuals and as a species i don 't know if i want to live in a i don 't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together i don 't want to be the last trivia know it all sitting on a mountain somewhere reciting to himself the state capitals and the i feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices to our search engines and our smartphones in the movies those movies are never about beautiful it 's always and i feel like we 're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in this is a question of leadership because it becomes a question of who leads the future on the one hand we can choose between a new golden age where information is more and on the other hand we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we 've all decided it 's not important what we know anymore that knowledge isn 't valuable because it 's all out there in the cloud and why would we ever bother learning anything those are the two choices we have i know which future i would rather be living in and we can all make that choice we make that choice by being curious inquisitive people who like to learn who don 't just say i 'm done learning for a lifetime i don 't have to learn new things anymore no every day we should be striving that 's where the people you see on jeopardy come from these know it alls they 're not rainman style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book i 've met a lot of them for the most part they are just normal folks we can live in one of these two worlds we can live in a world where our brains the things that we know continue to be the thing the choice is yours"
