  "transcript": "i create multicultural but let me first i lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six a very interesting experience we did all kinds of research but we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do like questionnaires at the end of every day busy work as you can imagine it 's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people in a small space for a long time there 's all kinds of psychological challenges how to keep a team together in these circumstances sleep i learned a lot about how individual crew members actually cope with a situation like this how you can keep a crew productive and happy so doing this mission i really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space we will venture into but and the seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world to come up with starship one important thing this is not a dystopian project this is not about oh my god the world is going wrong and we have to escape because we need another future somewhere else no no the project is basically inviting people to take a step away from earthbound constraints and so that 's that 's really the important part which is a slightly different approach from what you would expect from many many artists i 'm essentially dropping a basic idea into a group into a community people start gravitating to the idea sometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding how we build without a master plan we always come up with these fantastic that actually we can also inhabit the first version was done in in belgium and holland it was built with a team of almost fifty people this is the second iteration of that evolving architecture ecology and technology so there 's always a strong ecological component in the project here you can see now a very typical thing for this project project is that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects where six artists and designers locked themselves up i was part of that for four days inside the museum and of course obviously this is a very performative and very strong experience for all of us the next version of the project is currently rodriguez beltran who is also a ted fellow in the atacama desert in chile a magical place and it has a long history of being connected to space through observations of the stars it 's now home to alma the large telescope that 's that 's being developed there because suddenly sustainability is something we have to explore fully we have no other option so i 'm very curious to see what 's going to happen a specific thing for this particular version of the project is that i 'm very interested to see how we can connect with the local population the these people have been living there for a very long time and can be considered experts in sustainability so we 're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space by exploring and by using and exploring local traditions and to see how we can learn from the past and integrate that into our deep future thank you"
