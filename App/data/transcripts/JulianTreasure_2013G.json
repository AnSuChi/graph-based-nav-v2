  "transcript": "it 's the most powerful sound in the world probably it 's the only one that can start a war or say i love you and yet many people have the experience that when they speak people don 't listen to them and why is that how can we speak powerfully to make change in the world what i 'd like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from i 've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking i 'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list but these seven i think are pretty large first judging you can fall into this my mother in the last years of her life became very very negative and it 's hard to listen i remember one day i said to her it 's october one today and she said i know isn 't it dreadful it 's hard to listen when somebody 's that negative laughter and another form of negativity complaining well this is the national art of the u k it 's our national sport we complain about the weather maybe we 've all been this guy some people have they just pass it on to everybody else and don 't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who is being like that embroidery exaggeration it demeans our language actually sometimes for example if i see something that really is awesome what do i call it dogmatism the confusion of facts with opinions when those two things get conflated you 're listening into the wind it 's difficult to listen to that but is there a positive way to think about this yes there is i 'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones i 'm talking about this definition to greet or acclaim enthusiastically which is how i think our words will be received honesty of course being true in what you say being straight and clear the a is authenticity just being yourself a friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth which i think is a lovely way to put it the i is integrity and being somebody people can trust but i do mean wishing people well for two reasons first of all i think absolute honesty may not be what we want i mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps i 'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously now that 's what you say and it 's like the old song it is what you say it 's also the way that you say it you have an amazing toolbox this instrument is incredible and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened i 'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with which will increase the power of your speaking register for example you need to go down here to the chest you hear the difference because we associate depth with power and with authority warm like hot chocolate well if that 's not you that 's not the end of the world and there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice then prosody i love prosody this is the sing song the meta language that we use in order to impart meaning it 's root one for meaning in conversation people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don 't have any prosody at all monotone also we have repetitive prosody now coming in where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it 's actually not a question it 's a statement so let 's try and break that habit pace i can get very very excited by saying something really really quickly or i can slow right down and at the end of that of course is our old friend silence there 's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk is there we don 't have to fill it with ums can be very powerful of course pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal but you can do it just with pitch where did you leave my keys where did you leave my keys so slightly different and finally volume i can get really excited some people broadcast the whole time try not to do that that 's called sodcasting imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately not nice of course where this all comes into play most of all is when you 've got something really important to do it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people it might be proposing marriage asking for a raise a wedding speech it is if it 's really important you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it 's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up warm up your voice i 'm going to show you the six vocal warm up exercises that i do before every talk i ever do any time you 're going to deep breath in and sigh out ahhhhh like that one more time ahhhh and we 're going to go ba now your lips should be coming alive we 're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la la la la beautiful you 're getting really good at this and then roll an r rrrrrrr and if i can only do one the pros call this the siren it 's really good next time you speak do those in advance now let me just put this in context to close this is a serious point here this is where we are now right we speak not very people who simply aren 't listening in an environment that 's all about noise and bad acoustics i have talked about that on this stage in different phases what would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound that would thank you"
