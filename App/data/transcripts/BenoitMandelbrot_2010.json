  "transcript": "the topic i 'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it 's very old roughness is part of human life forever and now i got involved many years ago in a study of of this form of complexity and i found traces very strong traces i must say i would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents i prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity to someone who had latin but it is not so regularity is the contrary of roughness now why do i show a cauliflower a very ordinary and ancient vegetable because old and ancient as it may be it 's very complicated both at the same time if you try to weigh it of course it 's very easy to weigh it and when you eat it the weight matters but suppose suppose you try one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it so the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is now what did humanity do with that very very little so what i did actually is to is to study this problem and i found something quite quite surprising that one can measure roughness by a number a number brought a picture and said what just short of one point five it was one point four eight roughness of these surfaces i hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial they were and that number is roughness so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well so then if you try to to ask questions what 's the surface of a cauliflower well you measure and measure and measure each time you 're closer it gets bigger what 's the the closer you measure the longer it is the concept of length of coastline complete fallacy there 's no such thing surprisingly to begin with artificial landscapes which i invented sort of are used in in cinema all the time we see mountains in the distance they may be mountains but they may be just formulae just cranked on now it 's very easy to do it used to be very time consuming but now it 's nothing now a lung is something very strange anatomists were arguing very much about that some say that a normal male 's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball [ court ] and the others say no five basketball [ courts ] enormous disagreements and they stop branching not because of of any matter of principle but because of physical so what happens is that in a way you have a much branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale for a man and for a little rodent has been of great to the surgeons studying lung illnesses a geometry of things which had no geometry and a surprising aspect of it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely you get things like that this cloud is completely one hundred percent artificial which is taken from nature something so now this simple rule the seer of clouds had to take account of it i don 't know how much advanced these pictures are they 're old i was very much involved in it but then turned my attention to here is another thing which is rather which is not appreciated by many people occurred mathematicians got into into self praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature did not know it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane a man named peano and it became an object of extraordinary interest it was very important but mostly mostly interesting because a kind of break a separation between the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand and new mathematics coming from pure seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here i introduce something the set of and the objects which were used as examples when i was a child and and a student as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality and i found that this number was a good measurement of roughness when i first told it to my friends in mathematics they said but the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect this is a mess mess mess one day i decided halfway through my career i was held by so many things could i just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time so i looked which means he put inside everything long measurements big brownian it took my friends twenty years three of them they got together and together they had the proof one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which i 've seen without being able to prove them now everybody asks me at one point or another how did it all start what got you in that a geographer and a mathematician and so on a physicist well actually i started and i wrote books about it financial prices increments to the left you see data over a long period to the right on top you see a theory which is very very fashionable it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it now model price variation and it went really well fifty years ago for fifty years sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much much easier but i tell you at this point people listened to me now discontinuities are a nuisance and you have if you master and if you don 't master these you can master the little noise in a way it 's the story of my life my adolescence was spent during the german occupation of france since i thought that i might vanish within a day or a and after the war and which nobody can solve this is a construction of a man named [ gaston ] julia and [ pierre ] fatou if you could find something new anything you will get your and and i went from what 's called real numbers which are points on a line the equation is hidden there z goes into z squared plus c it 's so simple so dry it 's so this comes out and then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated that and so my principle has been to always present the it 's so complicated in one thousand nine hundred and ninety i was in cambridge u k to receive a prize so the newspaper in cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day five thousand letters from people saying but that 's simply a mandelbrot set very big which are repeated thank you very much"
