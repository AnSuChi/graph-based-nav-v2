  "transcript": "we retain just twenty five percent of what we hear now not you not this talk let 's define listening as making meaning from sound it 's a mental process and it 's a process of extraction we use some pretty cool techniques to do this one of them is pattern recognition so in a cocktail party like this sara pay attention some of you just sat up differencing is another technique we use if i left this and then there is a whole range of filters these filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to most people are entirely unconscious but they actually create our reality in a way because they tell us what we 're paying attention to right now i 'll give you one example of that intention is very important in sound in listening when i married my wife i promised her i would listen to her every day as if for the first time now that 's something i fall short of on a daily basis but it 's a great intention to have in a but that 's not all sound places us in space and in time and sound places us in time as well because sound always has time embedded in it in fact i would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future so sonority is time and meaning a great quote i said at the beginning we 're losing our listening why did i say that well there are a lot of reasons for this first of all we invented ways of recording first writing then audio recording and now video recording as well the premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared secondly the world is now it 's just hard into millions of tiny little personal we 're becoming impatient we don 't want oratory anymore we want sound bites and the art of conversation is being replaced we 're becoming desensitized our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention and that means it 's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet the subtle the understated this is a serious problem that we 're losing our listening this is not trivial because listening is our access to understanding conscious listening always creates understanding and only without conscious listening can these things happen a world where we 't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed so i 'd like to share with you five simple exercises tools you can take away with you to improve your own conscious listening would you like that audience yes good the first one is silence just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again if you can 't get absolute silence go for quiet that 's absolutely fine second i call this the mixer so even if you 're in a noisy environment like this and we all spend a lot of listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can i hear how many individual channels in that mix am i listening to you can do it in a beautiful place as well like this exercise i call savoring and this is a beautiful exercise it 's about enjoying mundane sounds this for example is my tumble dryer it 's a waltz one or just try this one on for size so mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention i call that the hidden choir it 's around us all the time the next exercise is probably the most important of all of these if you just take one thing away this is listening positions the idea that you can move your listening position to what 's appropriate to what you 're listening to this is playing with those filters remember i gave you those filters it 's starting to play with them as levers to get conscious about them and to move to different places these are just some of the listening positions or scales of listening positions that you can use there are many have fun with that it 's very exciting an acronym you can use this in listening in communication if you 're in any one of those roles and i think that probably is everybody who 's listening to this talk the acronym is rasa which is the sanskrit word for juice or essence and rasa stands for receive is very important in communication and ask ask questions afterwards now sound is my passion it 's my life i wrote a whole book about it so i live to listen that 's too much to ask for most people but i believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully connected in space and in time to the physical world around us connected in understanding to each other not to mention spiritually connected because every spiritual path i know of has listening and contemplation at its heart that 's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill and if we can teach listening in our schools now i don 't know how to do that but this is ted so i invite you to connect with me connect with each other take this mission out and let 's get listening taught in schools and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world a world of connection"
