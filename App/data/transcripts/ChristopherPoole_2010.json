  "transcript": "group of kids and they like to say funny words like barrel roll it 's a video game move from star fox found this website called futaba channel and it was a japanese forum and imageboard that and i stuck it up for my friends to use now six and a half years later over seven million people are using it contributing over seven hundred thousand posts per day forty eight boards this is what it looks like so what 's unique about the site is that it 's anonymous and it has no memory there 's no there 's no registration these things that we 're used to with with forums don 't exist on 4chan and that 's led to this discussion that 's completely raw completely unfiltered what the site 's known for because it has this environment is it 's fostered the creation of a lot of internet phenomena the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these lolcats and really simple classic bait and switch and rick astley pops out and rickrolls millions of people on television there are thousands of memes that come out of the site there are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream the ones i 've just shown you every day every month people are producing thousands of these so does a site like this have rules and so they 've come up with their own set of rules the rules of the internet and so there are three that i want to show you rule one is you don 't talk about b two is you do not talk about b no exceptions and i will spare you that slide i assure you it is very true b is the first board we started with and it is in many ways the beating heart of the website it is where a third of all the traffic is going and more than anything not just the memes they 've created but the exploits and chris just touched on one of those a second ago and that was the time one hundred poll and so they placed me on it and the internet got wind of it my community decided they wanted me to i didn 't instruct them to do it they just decided that that 's what they wanted and so you know three hundred and ninety percent approval rating ain 't so bad so they they broke that poll and i ended up on top i ended up at this really fancy party but that 's not what 's interesting about this it 's that they weren 't putting me at the top of this list they were actually it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top twenty one places to spell marblecake also the game the amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible and marble cake is significant because it is the channel that this group called is this group of people that protested and so these people over seven thousand people less than one month later organized in a hundred cities around the globe and the church of scientology and they have continued to do so now two full years they are still protesting so we 've got this activist group that 's this grassroots group that 's come out of the site and last i 'm going to show you the example the story of dusty the cat dusty is is the name that we 've given to this cat this young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on youtube and you know this didn 't sit well with with people and so there was this outpouring of support for people to to do something about this so what they did is they i mean they put csi to the internet detectives came out they they had his name he was arrested and so what i think is really intriguing about a community like 4chan is just that it 's this open place as i said it 's raw they 're endangered because we 're moving towards we 're moving towards you know a lack of privacy really we 're sacrificing a lot of that and i think in doing so moving towards those got a couple questions for you but if i ask them is the ted website going to go down cp you 're lucky that this is this is not being streamed to them live right now you made the case there but anonymity basically allows people to say anything all the rules gone you 've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography and i 'm just curious whether you you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you 've opened but i think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people there are very few places now where you can go and not have identity to be be completely anonymous and say and say whatever you 'd like but i think it 's important to have these places when i get emails people say thank you for giving me this place this outlet where i can come after work and be myself ca but words saying things you know can be i mean surely there are huge risks with that there are certainly but ca tell me about what i mean i think you asked and within twenty four hours it had over twelve thousand responses and the thing is i didn 't that presentation because i can 't read to you anything that they said but there there were some good things that came out of that too love and peace were mentioned ca love and peace were mentioned kind of with quote marks around them right cp cats and dogs were mentioned too ca and that that content is now it has been taken off ca okay well now i 'm not sure i would have necessarily recommended everyone at ted to go and check it out anyway chris you yourself i mean you 're a figure of some intrigue you 've got this surprising yet what 's the commercial picture here cp the commercial picture is that there really isn 't much of one i guess the site has adult content on it i mean obviously it 's got some very offensive obscene content on it just in terms of language alone and when you 've got that you 've pretty much sacrificed any hope of of i 'm back in school right now ca but what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about 4chan cp awkward conversations the content is not dinner table in the least but my parents i think part of why they they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don 't understand it ca and they were probably pleased to see you on top of the time poll i just went back to school and i am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning kind of taking whatever i 've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to a physical community"
