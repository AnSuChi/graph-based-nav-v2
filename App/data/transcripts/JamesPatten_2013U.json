  "transcript": "computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression but for the most part that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones and i 'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live i was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays this one 's called the chase there are two pairs of shoes a man 's pair and a woman 's pair and they play out this slow tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around my friend andy cavatorta was building a robotic harp for bjork 's biophilia tour and i wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play the harp has four separate pendulums and each pendulum has eleven strings so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to and the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit and a researcher from a science education center in australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on and when you think about it this makes a lot of sense that using specialized physical objects would help people but the thing that struck me about all of these different projects i wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building and we built this array of five hundred and twelve different so i wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on to explore this idea i built an army of small robots and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels they 're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions and when you couple these robots with a video projector you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information we want to tweak the color we just enter the color mode and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color so the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and a dispatcher can grab and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world this is a video chat application it 's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object with this interface we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible but one of the areas that i 'm most excited about using this platform for so here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways feel these physical handles pulling back against us so feeling what 's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction so we 're just beginning to explore what 's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment maybe this is there 's no touchscreen there 's no technology visible at all but when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next ted talk"
