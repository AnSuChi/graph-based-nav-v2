  "transcript": "great honor to be here it 's a great honor to be here talking about cities talking about i really do believe that mayors have the political position to really change people 's lives that 's the place to be rio 's a and i really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of rio but it was not easy to get there actually it was a very hard we had to beat we had to beat the most powerful man in the world defending his own city so it was not easy at all and actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that i think fits perfectly to the situation of rio winning the olympic that you don 't have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way that cities are a with some you can really get cities to be a great great place to live you probably think about a a city full of energy a vibrant city full of green and nobody showed that better than carlos saldanha in last year some parts of rio are pretty much like that but it 's not like that everywhere we 're like every big city in the world we 've got lots of people and i want to use an example of rio that we 're doing in madureira in this region so every time you see a so go inside these open spaces it 's going to be a place where people can meet where you can put nature the temperature 's going to drop two three degrees centigrade so the first commandment i want to leave you tonight is a city of the future has to be so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you so how do you do you move these people around when you have three point five billion people living in cities by high capacity transportation but there is a problem it 's the brt the bus rapid transit so you get a bus simple bus that everybody knows the contractors they don 't like that you don 't have to dig deep down you can build nice stations this is actually a station that we 're doing in rio again you don 't have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that this station has the same comfort the same features so spending much less money the colored lines you see there it 's our transportation network in this present time today we only carry eighteen percent of our population in with the brts we 're doing again the cheapest and fastest way we 're going to move to sixty three percent of the population being carried by high capacity transportation so remember what i said you don 't always have to be rich or powerful to get things done you can find original ways to get things done so the second commandment i want to leave you tonight is a city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration of its people moving to the third commandment and this is the most controversial one it has to do with the favelas the slums whatever you call it there are different names but the point we want to make here tonight is favelas are not let me just show a map of rio again rio has six point three million inhabitants more than twenty percent one point four million live in the favelas all these red parts are favelas so you see they are spread all over the city this is a so i want to make two points here tonight about favelas the first one is bring in the basic services mainly education and health with high quality i 'm going to give a fast example here this was an old building in a favela in rio the second point i want to make about the favelas is you 've got to open spaces in the favela bring infrastructure to the favelas to the slums wherever you are rio and then we built this what we call a knowledge square this is a place with high technology and this is the kind of change you can get for that you cannot deal with a city if it 's not socially integrated between november and may rio 's completely packed we have problems you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes this was something we did with ibm and i wanted to show that i can govern my city using technology from so osorio good to be there with you i 've already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year so how 's the weather in rio now of year get lots of traffic jams people get mad at the mayor so how 's the traffic tonight osario well traffic tonight is fine let me get you one of our we had heavy traffic but nothing of big concern we 're going to move so that i can make a conclusion so no files this place no paperwork no distance twenty four seven working so the fourth commandment i want to share with you here tonight is a city of the future has to use technology to be present i don 't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city but everything that and we cannot see that as a problem that is fantastic if there 's three point five billion now it 's going to be six billion then it 's going to be ten billion that is great that means we 're going to have ten billion so a city of the future thank you very much"
