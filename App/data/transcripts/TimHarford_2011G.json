  "transcript": "the second world war a german prison camp and this man archie cochrane is a prisoner of war and a and he has a problem the problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition and people do terrible things in wars they 've got bored they 've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun on one particular occasion one of the guards threw a grenade and archie cochrane as the camp doctor was one of the first men in to clear up the mess and one more thing so the situation seemed pretty desperate but archie cochrane was a resourceful person and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black zesty it 's a rich source of vitamin so archie splits the men under his care as best he can into two equal groups he gives half of them vitamin c he gives half of them vitamin carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book so cochrane then goes to the germans who are running the prison camp now you 've got to imagine at the moment forget this photo imagine this guy with this this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair he hasn 't been able to shave a sort of billy connolly figure cochrane he starts ranting at these germans in this scottish accent in fluent german by the way but in a scottish accent and explains to them how german culture was the culture that gave schiller and goethe and he can 't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated and he vents his frustrations breaks down and weeps but a young german doctor picks up archie cochrane 's exercise book and says to his colleagues this evidence is incontrovertible if we don 't supply vitamins to the prisoners it 's a war crime i 'm not although i think that would also be completely awesome i 'm telling you this story because and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive so the symptoms of the complex are you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution now archie was a doctor so he hung around with doctors a lot and doctors suffer from the god complex a lot i see it in the politicians we vote for people who in the face of an incredibly complicated world are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works and you know with the future billions that we 've been hearing about the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way imagine for a moment that instead of tim harford in front of you there was hans rosling you know hans the mick jagger of ted and but a typical hans rosling graph but think instead about what it leaves out longevity that 's about it so three pieces of data for each country three pieces of data three pieces of data is nothing i mean have a look at this graph this is produced by the physicist cesar hidalgo he 's at mit now you won 't be able to understand a word of it but this is what it looks like cesar has trolled the database of over five thousand different products and he 's used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products and it 's wonderful wonderful you show all these interconnections all these interrelations brilliant work cesar and i tried to write a piece for the new york times magazine explaining how this works and what we learned is cesar 's work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine five thousand products that 's still nothing five thousand products imagine counting every product category in cesar hidalgo 's data imagine you had one second per product category in about the length of this session you would have counted all five thousand now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in walmart there are one hundred thousand there it would take you all london or new york it 's even more difficult in edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan if you wanted to count every product and service on offer in new york there are ten billion of them it would take you three hundred and seventeen years this is how complex the economy we 've created is and i 'm just counting toasters here i 'm not trying to solve the middle east the complexity here is unbelievable and just a piece of context we can post some now i 'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here i 'm not trying to say we we can 't solve complicated problems in a complicated world we clearly can but the way we solve them is with humility to abandon the god complex and to actually use a here 's an example maybe i should clarify it this baby is a human body variation and selection trial and error trial and error and it 's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error you could use it in an industrial 's say you wanted to make detergent let 's say you 're unilever and you want to make detergent in a factory near liverpool how you create a spray of detergent you sell it at a supermarket you make lots of money how do you design that nozzle and he will or she will calculate the optimal design of the now unilever did this but the geneticist professor steve jones describes how unilever actually did solve this problem you take a nozzle you try out all ten you try out ten variations on that one you see how this works right we have no idea no idea at all and now and we 've heard a lot about how economies function the u s economy is still the world 's greatest economy how did it become the world 's greatest i could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the u s economy but i think the most salient one is this ten percent of american businesses disappear that is a huge failure rate it 's far higher than the failure rate of say americans ten percent of americans don 't disappear every year which leads us to conclude american businesses fail faster than americans and therefore american businesses are evolving faster than americans and eventually they 'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets but it 's this process of trial and error that explains this great divergence and people sometimes say to me well now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing so i say you think it 's obvious i will admit it 's obvious when schools stop giving them lists of you must be lazy or stupid when schools stop doing that all the time i will admit that yes it 's obvious that trial and error is a good thing when a politician stands up i have no idea how to do it i we 're going to test them out they 'll probably all fail then we 'll test some other ideas find some that work we 'll build on those we 'll get rid of the ones that don 't when a politician campaigns on that platform and more importantly when voters like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politician then i will admit and that thank you until then until then i 'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the god complex because it it 's so hard to admit our own fallibility it 's so uncomfortable and archie cochrane understood this as well as anybody there 's this one trial he ran many years after world war ii he wanted to test out the question of where is it that patients should recover from heart attacks should they recover in a or should they recover at home and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment he gathered together all his colleagues around his table they 're not statistically significant but we have something and it turns out that you 're right they should be in hospital and there 's this uproar and all the doctors start pounding the table and saying we always said you were unethical archie you 're killing people with your clinical trials you need to shut it down now shut it down at once and there 's this huge hubbub archie lets it die down i swapped the two columns around it turns out your hospitals are killing people and they should be at home would you like to close down the trial now or should we wait until we have robust results tumbleweed and the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there i do not want to have my conclusions tested it feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law it isn 't easy 's incredibly painful and since i started talking about this subject and researching this subject i 've been really haunted by something a japanese mathematician said on the subject yutaka taniyama developed this amazing conjecture called the it turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving but it was always a conjecture taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true and shortly before his he said but he made mistakes in a good direction i tried to emulate but i realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes"
