  "transcript": "i want to say a word for nature because we haven 't talked that much about it the last couple days i want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that i have found really nothing more than a literary conceit it 's not a technology it 's very powerful for i think changing our relationship to the natural world and that tool is very simply as chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants ' or the animals ' point of view it 's not my idea other people have hit on it but i 've tried to take it to some new places let me tell you where i got it like a lot of my ideas like a lot of the tools i use i found it in the garden i 'm a very devoted gardener i was planting potatoes it was the first week of may this is new england when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom they 're just white clouds above i was here planting my chunks cutting up potatoes and planting it bumblebees just making this thing vibrate and one of the things i really like about gardening is that it doesn 't take all your concentration you really can 't get hurt it 's not like woodworking and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation and the question i asked myself that afternoon in the garden working alongside that bumblebee was what did i and that bumblebee both of us were and both of us probably if i can imagine the bee 's point of view i had decided what kind of potato i wanted to plant i had picked my yukon gold or yellow finn or whatever it was and and i was planting it i 'm going for that blossom 'm going to get the nectar and i 'm going to leave we have a grammar that suggests i plant but that day it occurred to me what if that grammar is nothing more than a course the bee thinks he 's in charge or she 's in charge but we know better we know that what 's going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower and when i say manipulated i 'm talking about in a darwinian sense right i mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits color scent and going off to the next and i realized then i wasn 't either i had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its into spreading its genes giving it a little bit more habitat and that 's when i got the idea which was well what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention co evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically deforest the the competition of grasses right i had thought always and in fact had written this in my first book this was a book about gardening that and that 's what the lawn was i 'm a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees who they compete with for sunlight and so by getting us to mow the lawn we keep the trees from coming back which in so i started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called the botany of desire and i realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug cannabis cross has something to say about us and that wouldn 't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world now the test of any idea i said it was a literary conceit is what does it get us and when you 're talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how does it meet the aldo leopold test which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction and i would submit that this idea does this so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some entertaining insights about about human desire as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species ' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is and this is in the realm of intellectual history which is that we have this darwinian revolution one hundred and fifty years ago ugh mini me we have this intellectual this darwinian revolution in which thanks to darwin we figured out we are none of us really believes this we are still cartesians the children of descartes who believe that subjectivity consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another as soon as you start seeing things from the plant 's point of view or the animal 's point of view you realize that the real literary conceit is that is the idea that nature that consciousness is everything and that 's another very important thing it does looking at the world from other species ' points of view is a cure for the disease of human self importance you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world and it 's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool but you know there 's a comedian who said well who 's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and they 're just as interesting i 'll give you two examples lima bean does when it 's attacked by it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mite that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean so what plants have while we have consciousness tool making language they have biochemistry and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond we can imagine their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and i think it 's really the scandal of the human genome project you know we went into it thinking forty thousand or fifty thousand human genes and we came out with only twenty three thousand just to give you grounds for comparison so who 's the more sophisticated species well we 're all equally sophisticated we 've been evolving evolving just as long just along different paths cure for self importance way to sort of make us feel the darwinian and that 's really what i do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people feel what we know being manipulated by corn and the talk you heard about ethanol to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense applause it is part of corn 's corn 's scheme for world domination the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we 've decided ethanol is going to help us it 's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will and that we are let me take you to a very different kind of farm this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia i went looking for a farm where these and i found it in a man the farmer 's name is joel salatin and i took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that i 've ever come across in twenty five years of writing about nature the idea is he 's got six different species of animals as well in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it 's permaculture those of you who know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the what else does he have all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens and this is a lot more than growing food as you 'll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the cartesian idea that either nature 's winning or we 're winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished relatively new hooked to a car battery even i could carry a quarter acre paddock set it up in fifteen minutes cows graze one day they move ok they graze everything down intensive he waits three days and then we towed in something called the eggmobile the eggmobile is a very he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and three hundred and fifty hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties and what they 're doing is very interesting they 're digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grubs the larvae of flies but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are form of protein so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they 're pushing around the and in the process they 're spreading the manure out very useful second ecosystem service and third while they 're in this paddock they are of course defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of the grass just enters this blaze of growth he can graze again he can cut he can bring in another species like the lambs or he can make hay twenty five thousand dozen eggs twenty thousand broilers one thousand turkeys one thousand rabbits an immense amount of food you know you hear can organic feed the world well look how much food you can produce on one hundred acres if you do this kind of what happens to the grass when you do this when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the and plants need to keep the the root mass so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is this is how soil is created it 's created from the bottom up this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses he 's not a he 's a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished more for us less for nature here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a cartesian system more or less and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take are so cheap they could be all over africa in no time that we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process this a way to reanimate the world and that 's what 's so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel darwin 's insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hopeful about"
