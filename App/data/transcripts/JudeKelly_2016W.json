  "transcript": "why do we think that stories by men are deemed to be of universal importance and stories by women are thought to be merely about women my grandmother left school when she was twelve she had fourteen children and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people i 'll never meet fought for women to have rights and i 'm determined to do and part of the joy i had in going there was going to these caves the art how we understand our identity how we look at our surroundings who we find out about each other because of the meaning of our lives lives that 's what art is for i thought it was a bit like me when i was a little girl and i asked the curator of the caves i said tell me about the men and women who painted these and he said women didn 't paint these pictures and i said well it was eleven thousand years ago i said how do you know and he said women don 't do these things men made these marks women don 't because that 's an attitude that i 've seen continuously all my life as a theater maker the holy man similarly we 're told that creative genius resides in the masculine that it is the masculine that will be able to tell us about who we really are that the masculine will tell the universal story on behalf of all of us whereas women artists will really just talk about women 's experiences women 's issues only really relevant to women and of passing interest to men and really only some men and it 's that conviction and unless we 're prepared to believe that women 's stories really matter and then change can 't really come i want to tell you about two examples of stories that are thought to be of universal i took my two children when they were little caroline was eight and robby was five to see e t but he wants to go so the children have a plot they decide they 're going to take him back to his spaceship as soon as they can the baddies have found out and they 're catching up and they 've got sirens and they 've got their guns they 've got the and they 're going to save e t why can 't i come and then all of a sudden i realized they weren 't children they were boys all boys and she felt humiliated and spurned so i wrote to steven spielberg and i said i don 't know if you understand the psychological importance of what 's happened and but i 'm still hopeful but i thought it was interesting because if you read reviews of what he intended with e t he says very specifically i wanted the world to understand that we should love and embrace difference he thought he was writing a story about human and this is common men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication but of course how could they be they are writing from male experience through male 's eyes we have to have a look at this ourselves we have to be and say actually this is written by a male artist not an artist but then females need to have fifty percent of the rights for the stage the film the novel the place of creativity but it 's not my question my question is why was i taught as a young woman that this was the quintessential example it 's about a young finished with ophelia he turns on his mum because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle and enjoy sex despite the fact that it only had two women in it and unless i reeducate myself i am always going to think that women 's stories matter less than men 's and it wouldn 't have had global recognition it 's realism when a woman writes about doing it it 's an unfortunate genetic this is not just something that belongs to then i mean this is what my male lecturer said to me well there are three women directors in britain he said jude so which of those three would you like my music teacher said exactly the same he said ' women don 't conduct ' we 've made our mark the current head of the paris conservatoire said recently it takes great physical strength to conduct a symphony and women are too weak well they can 't paint very well the writer v s naipaul said two years i can read two paragraphs and know immediately if it 's written by a woman and i just stop reading because it 's not worthy of me audience whoa and it goes on we have to find a way because once you feel that you can 't stand in the central space and speak on behalf of you will feel that you can offer your goods up to a small select group you will tend to do smaller work on smaller stages your economic power will be less your reach of audiences will be less and your credit will be less and we do finally give artists these incredible prominent spaces the world because they are our storytellers supposing you 're an accountant or an entrepreneur or a medic or a scientist should you care about women artists because as you can see from the cave paintings all civilizations all of humanity have relied upon artists it will be about men so let 's make a change let 's make a change to all our institutions and not just in the west don 't forget this message of of women to hold creative genius is being told to girls and women in nigeria in china in russia in indonesia all over the world girls and women are being told that they can 't finally hold the idea of creative inspiration and i want to ask you do you believe that do you believe that women can be a creative genius buy their work insist that their voices are heard find platforms on which their voices will be made and remember this that in a sense if we 're going to get past this moment of a world where we know that we are unequal it 's artists who have to imagine a different world then we would have the energy and the stamina to work towards it when i see this little i want to know that the little girl now can stand there and think she 's entitled to her dreams she 's entitled to her destiny and she 's entitled to speak on behalf of the whole world be recognized for it and applauded"
