  "transcript": "let 's face it it 's the language of air traffic control diplomacy english is everywhere but more chinese people are learning english than english speakers are learning chinese last i heard there are two dozen universities in china right now teaching is taking over and in addition to that it 's been predicted that at the end of the century and on top of that it 's at the point where instant translation of live speech is not only possible but it gets better every year the reason i 'm reciting those things to you is because i can tell that we 're getting to the point where a question is going to start being asked which is why should we learn foreign languages other than if english happens to be foreign to one why bother to learn another one when it 's getting to the point where almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate but i first want to address the one that you 're probably most likely to have heard of because actually it 's more dangerous than you might think and that is the idea that a language channels your thoughts that the vocabulary and the grammar of different languages gives everybody a different kind acid trip so to speak that is a marvelously enticing idea marked as feminine so la table la mesa you just have to deal with it it has been shown that if you are a speaker of one of those languages and you happen to be asked how you would imagine a table talking then much more often than could possibly be an accident a french or a spanish speaker says that the table would talk with a high it 's hard not to love data like that and many will tell you that that means that there 's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages but you what is the worldview so for example let 's take an english speaker up on the screen that is he speaks english i presume he has a worldview now that is donald trump in his way he speaks english as well and she is an english speaker too here are three speakers of the english language what worldview do those three people have in common what worldview is shaped through the english language that unites them it 's a highly fraught concept and so obscure psychological flutters it 's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world what would the other reasons be there are some one of them is that if you want to imbibe a culture if you want to drink it in if you want to become part of it then whether or not the language channels the culture and that seems doubtful if you want to imbibe the culture you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in there 's no other way there 's an interesting arcand read out in english on the page if you want to look him up he did a film called funny passionate interesting women there 's one scene closest to the end where they have to take a friend to an anglophone hospital and they speak it more slowly they have accents they 're not idiomatic suddenly these characters that you 've fallen in love with become husks of themselves they 're shadows of themselves to go into a culture and to only ever process people through that kind of skrim curtain is to never truly get the culture and so to the extent that hundreds of languages will be so that 's one reason it 's been shown that if you speak two languages dementia is less likely to set in and so that ought to give you some sense of when and then third so for example have in common all those things have in common the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars they stay still and the vowels dance around the consonants who wouldn 't want to roll that around in their mouths you can get that from hebrew you can get that from ethiopia 's main language amharic that languages have different word orders learning how to speak with different word order is like driving on the different side of a street if you go to certain country or the feeling that you get when you put witch hazel around your eyes and you feel the tingle a language can do that to you so for example the cat in the hat comes back a book that i 'm sure we all do you know where i found him do you know where he was he was eating cake in the tub yes he was fine he was tub inside gorging cake no mistake gorging chewing that just feels good imagine being able to do that for years and years at a time or have you ever learned any cambodian me either but if i did i would get to roll around in my mouth not some baker 's dozen of vowels like english has but a good thirty different vowels scooching and oozing around in the cambodian mouth like bees in a hive that is what a language can get you when it 's never been easier to teach yourself another language it used to be that you had to go to a classroom and there would be some diligent teacher some genius teacher in there but that person was only in there at certain times and you had to go then and then was not most times you had to go to class i cut my teeth on those or a cassette or even that antique object known as a cd other than that you had books that didn 't work that 's just the way it was today you can lay down lie on your living room floor sipping bourbon and teach yourself any language that you want to with wonderful sets such as rosetta stone i highly recommend the lesser known as well you can do it any time therefore you can do it more and better couldn 't have done it twenty years ago when the idea of having any language you wanted in your pocket coming from your phone would have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people thank you very much"
