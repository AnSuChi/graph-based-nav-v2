  "transcript": "every seven years i close it for one year to pursue in that year not available for any of our clients it is a lovely and very energetic time music and design and we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know and for even more that you 've never heard of and i get over time bored by them and for sure in our case our work started to look the same you see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book quite the similar idea book in a die cut so i decided to close it down for one year also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the years of our lives learning then there is another forty years that 's really reserved for working and then tacked on at the end of it are about fifteen years for retirement and i thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years that 's clearly probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two and they rang very true for me i can see my work as a job i do it for money i likely already look forward to the weekend on thursdays and i probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism but at the same time there will be periods when i think is all that really hard work really worth my while i am not a religious person myself but i europe and the u s didn 't really feel enticing because i knew them too asia it was the most beautiful landscapes i had seen in asia were sri lanka and bali it 's a wonderful society i arrived there in september two thousand and eight and pretty much started to work right away there is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself however the first thing that i needed was and so we created this series of as a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message on the back of the shirt just before i left new york i decided and i don 't have to do anything so and it turned out that and all the stuff i could afford i didn 't like so one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture this one of course still works with the wild dogs it 's not quite and i think by the time this lamp came about i had finally made peace with those dogs it includes three hundred and thirty compasses and we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside and make those compasses go then this is a fairly so i will not really go and i was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical and i 'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals this is ferran adria many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of barcelona el bulli his restaurant is open seven months every year he closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff his latest numbers are fairly impressive he can seat eight thousand people and he has two point two million requests for reservations if i look at my cycle seven years one year sabbatical it 's twelve point five percent of my time and if i look at companies that are actually more successful than mine there is some good successes scotch tape came out of this program as well as art fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3m google of course very famously gives twenty percent for their software engineers to pursue anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical that 's about five percent of everybody so i 'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up talk to them about if it was successful or not i 've found that finding out about what i 'm going to like in the future my very best way is to talk and then i told as many many people as i possibly could about it so that there was no way that i could chicken in the beginning on the first sabbatical it was rather i had thought that i should do this without any plan that this vacuum of time somehow would i just reacted to little requests not work requests those i all said no to but other little requests sending mail to japanese design magazines and things like that so i became my own intern and i very quickly divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan very much like in grade school nine to ten future thinking i had fun basically everything we 've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking and i 'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical one of the strands of thinking i was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated this whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies and not for everybody else we were asked to design an identity for casa da musica the rem music center in porto in portugal and even though i desired to do an identity that doesn 't use the architecture i failed at that and mostly also because i realized out of a rem koolhaas presentation to the city of porto where he talked about a conglomeration which i understood after i translated it from architecture speech in to regular colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software the casa da musica logo generator that 's connected to a scanner which when you actually have to design a beethoven poster comes in handy because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same so it will always fit together conceptually of course 's music is performed it gets its own logo or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers who all performed there get their own casa da musica logo it works the same internally whose casa da musica portraits wind up on their business cards the truck they go on tour with or there 's a smaller contemporary and one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it like this donna toney poster or chopin or mozart or la monte young you can take the shape and make typography out of it you can grow it underneath the skin you can have a poster for a family event in front of the house or a rave underneath the house as well as educational services until that point i had been mostly involved or used the language of design which was fine with me on one hand i have nothing against selling my parents are both salespeople but i did feel that i spent so much time learning this language why do i only i showed some of it at earlier teds before under the title things i 've learned in my life so far i 'll just show two now this is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in new york it says five weeks and you see the self confidence almost comes back but not quite these are some pictures visitors sent to me and then the city of amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something we used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece we got two hundred and fifty thousand coins from the central bank created this fairly floral obsessions make my life worse and my work better and the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between should i really take as much money as i can or should i leave the piece intact as it is right now one hundred volunteers a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it so when it was finally done and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and and the amsterdam police in all their wisdom and they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters i think you see you see them sweeping you see them sweeping right here that 's the police getting rid of it all so after eight hours that 's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing a bigger project in bali it 's a movie about happiness and here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us just a bit too ornamental and my studio is very close to the monkey forest so we asked those guys to do it again they did a fine job but had so of course whatever you don 't really do yourself doesn 't really so it 's going to be a while and of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile then you can of course always go and see this guy"
