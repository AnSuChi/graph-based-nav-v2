  "transcript": "and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help jung in afghanistan you get the picture afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world war and malnutrition kills people together with hope but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is seventeen years old which means they grow up in such an environment and i repeat myself in thirty years of war ethnic conflicts bad health shame fear and cumulative traumatic experiences local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non governmental organizations and people had hope until they realized their situation worsens every day either because they are being killed or because somehow they are poorer than eight years ago one figure for that fifty four percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition but i want to have a brilliant future for my son and for me it 's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation so doctors prescribe medication and donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads and depression stays intact because people don 't have tools to cope with it to get over it so soon after my arrival i had confirmed something which i had already that my instruments come from the heart of modern europe yes however what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds they are universal and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context and i want to participate again in my family life was very important because the family is central in afghans ' and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones because they do not want to burden traumatized people also easily lose control symptoms are hyper arousal and memory flashbacks so people are in a constant fear and they cannot control it to compensate this loss of inner control they try to control the outside very understandably mostly the family and unfortunately this fits very well husbands start mothers and fathers beat their children and afterward they feel awful they did not want to do this it just happened they lost control the desperate try so everybody needs a sense for the future and the afghan sense of the future is but i can feel myself again so the key here is empathy somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you somebody has to feel how you felt and somebody has to see you and listen to you everybody must be able to know what and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children and i started thinking about a counseling program but of course i needed help and funds and one evening i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul and i explained to him quickly i would this man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said if you want to do this call me so i was able to launch a three year project with caritas germany and we trained thirty afghan women and men and we opened fifteen we developed thousand and eight up until today a substantial change and step forward has been taking place the european union delegation in kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the ministry of public health to lobby this approach we succeeded we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding this means certainly to retrain all health staff but for that we already have the training manuals which are approved by the ministry and moreover this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan so we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces and you are the first to see the results we wanted to know if what is being done is effective and here you can see and all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse psycho social counseling only without medication and you can see the symptoms so this makes us very happy because now we also have some evidence that this is working so here you see this is a health facility in northern afghanistan and every morning it looks like this all over and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients but now this will change they go to the clinics because they want to cure their immediate symptoms and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions develop their resources to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future and i would like to share one short vignette one hazara then we would have killed each other and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future and another counselor said to me after the training you know i never knew why i survived the killings in my but now i know because i am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in afghanistan so i believe and this is a really and also i think without and without considering this in all humanitarian projects we cannot build up civil societies and i think it must be can be could be replicated elsewhere i thank you for your attention"
