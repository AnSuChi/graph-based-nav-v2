  "transcript": "i don 't know about you but i 've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about should i be be wary like you i 'm very tempted by the latest thing but at the other hand a couple of years ago i gave up all of my possessions sold all my technology except for a bicycle and rode across three thousand miles on the u s back roads under the power of my one body fuelled mostly by twinkies and junk food i 've since then tried to keep technology at arm 's length in many ways so it doesn 't master my life i run a website on cool tools where i issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology so i 'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity as it relates to nature as it relates to the spiritual and i 'm not even sure we and one definition of technology is that which is first recorded this is the first example of the modern use of technology that i can find it was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the applied arts and science at cambridge university in he says technology is anything that was invented after you were born so it sums up a lot of what we 're talking about danny hillis actually has an update on that he says technology is anything that doesn 't quite work yet something again that went back to something more fundamental something that was deeper and as i struggled to to understand that i came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to to work this morning going to talk about this for the first time so this is a very rough attempt to to think out loud the question that i came up with was and by that i don 't mean does it want chocolate or vanilla what are its inherent trends and biases what are its tendencies one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms which we 've heard a lot about what if we looked at the universe in our culture what does technology want and i think once we ask that question because obviously if we we don 't really know we have really no idea craig venter 's tremendous and brilliant attempt to to dna sequence things in the ocean is great brian farrell 's work is all part this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on earth and one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly we would begin to see some incredible this is an ant honey in its abdomen each one of these organisms that we 've described that you 've seen from jamie and others these magnificent things what they 're doing each one of them is they 're hacking i can 't think of a single general principle of biology that does not you 'll realize that because every single one of them is hacking something about it this is a sea slug it 's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it and the one on the bottom the blue one is a juvenile that has not yet brown green algae pond scum into its body and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are the protests the little things bacteria and the archaea bacteria the archaeas that 's one way to look at life on earth today but a more interesting way the current way to take the long view is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective and here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time we this is all the same six kingdoms you see four thousand representative species and you can see where we are but what i like about this is it shows that every living organism on earth today fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved but we see that each one of these is actually there 's several things that we see one of the things about we find life at the bottom of every drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up and there 's bacteria in the pores of that rock it 's ubiquitous and it wants to be more more and more of the inert matter of the of the globe is being touched and animated by life the second thing is is we see we also see specialization we see the movement from a general purpose cell to the more specific and specialized and we see a drift towards complexity that 's very intuitive and actually we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over and the last thing i bring back this nudibranch one of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability and by that it means that there is more and more of life like those chloroplast cells they 're completely surrounded by other life they never touch the inner matter there is more and more complexity long term trends in technology and again my question is what does technology want i discovered that there 's also a drift toward specialization there 's this is all the contents of a japanese home i actually had my daughter gave her a tally counter and i gave her an assignment last and it came up with six thousand different species of products so we 're seeing huge numbers of of diversity in the kinds of things this is this is actually what we 're headed towards world machines and thirdly the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche and i 'm happy to say i was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological but that 's pretty evident so the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution towards complexity that is maybe not a big surprise because if we that its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it and if we were to do that we would find out this is niles eldredge but as a sideline he happens to collect cornets he has one of the world 's largest collections and try to derive this is his chart which is not quite published yet but the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom those indicate basically a parentage of of a type of of cornet that was no longer made that does not happen in biology but that does happen in technology and it turns out that that 's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system in fact this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about so i suggested this to an historian of science and he said well what about you know come on what about steam so around and the thing that think about well maybe that 's just a random sample maybe i should do this sort of in a more conservative way so i took the great big one thousand eight hundred and ninety five montgomery ward 's catalog but i took this page things and the answer is all of them all of them are still being produced so you 've got corn shellers i don 't know who needs a corn sheller be it corn shellers you 've technologies don 't die in fact you can buy for fifty bucks a stone age knife made exactly the same way that they were made ten thousand what 's important is that this information actually never died out it 's not just that it was resurrected it 's continued all along and in papua new guinea they were making stone axes until two decades ago just as a course of of practical matters even when we try to get rid so we 've all heard about the but i actually went back and took the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited is decreasing over time so this makes sense because in a certain sense what culture is that 's what it 's for it 's so that ideas don 't die out and when we take that we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long term trajectory again in life 's evolution we find that each case each of the major transitions in life what they 're really about is accelerating and changing the way which evolution happens so all these steps in evolution are increasing basically the evolution of evolvability so what 's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas these new hacks and then what we see in the singularity that prophesized by kurzweil and others his idea that technology is accelerating evolution it 's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas so if you have life hacking life means hacking that is what we call an that 's the definition of infinite game a finite game is play to win and an infinite game is played to keep playing and i believe that technology is actually a cosmic force the origins of technology was not in one thousand eight hundred and twenty nine but was actually at the beginning of the big bang and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed the entire universe was compressed into a and at the big bang what it expanded was the potential for difference options and so when we grab a hammer that 's what we 're grabbing and that 's why we continue to grab technology because we want those things those things each time we make a new opportunity place we 're allowing and i think it 's really important because if you can imagine mozart before the technology of the piano was invented imagine hitchcock there are millions of young children being born whose technology of of self expression has not yet been invented we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true that 's what technology really 'm going to skip through some of the objections because i don 't have answers to why there 's deforestation i don 't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies i don 't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom because it 's so close to what life is about maybe in some ways the fact that that what we 're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it it 's a terrible thing to spray ddt on cotton fields but it 's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village that 's what we 're talking about you see technology is a way to evolve the evolution it 's a way to and so when i think about what technology wants i think that it has to do with the fact that every person here and i really believe this every person here has an assignment and your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is and if you play that well you 'll have other people involved so even that game extends and continues even when you 're gone that and so i think that we should embrace"
