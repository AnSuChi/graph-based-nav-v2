  "transcript": "in the past several days i heard people talking about china and also i talked to friends about china and chinese internet something is very challenging to me i want to make my friends understand china is complicated so i always want to tell the story like one hand it is that the other hand is that you can 't just tell a one sided story i 'll give an example china is a bric country bric country means brazil on the other hand china is a sick country the terminology coined by facebook ipo papers the four countries have no access to facebook and now today i want to tell you my personal you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom weird things from the north but china also has a great that 's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world it 's not only to and even separate themselves into blocks not united but if you think the chinanet is something like a the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past fifteen years the cat so today i want to upgrade it to two point zero version that 's the biggest population of netizens internet users in the whole world so how to make it it 's and we chinese copycat every one so that 's the kind of that 's not only to censor but on the other hand they want to keep the server in beijing so they can access the data any time they want that 's also the reason google was pulled out from china because they can 't accept the fact government wants to keep the server for example mubarak he shut down the internet he wanted to prevent the netizens that means keep the server in your inside of tunisia so he can 't prevent it his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption he was the first to topple but those two very smart international censorship policies didn 't prevent chinese social media sphere a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of chinese officials so when these three hundred million people microbloggers even they block the tweet in our censored platform but itself the chinanet but itself can create very powerful energy which has never happened in the chinese history two thousand and eleven in july two [ unclear ] trains crashed authorities literally wanted to cover up the there were ten million criticisms of the posting the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for ten years environment ministry and the american embassy in beijing because the ministry blamed the american embassy for intervening in chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of beijing so the up is the embassy data the pm two point five he showed one hundred and but that but ninety nine percent of chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the embassy 's side i live in beijing every day i just watch the american embassy 's data to decide whether i should open my window you know twitter and twitter clones have a kind of maybe in germany in german language it may be just you can see exactly one chinese tweet is equal to three point five english tweets chinese is always cheating right so because of this the chinese really regard this microblogging as a media not only a headline to and also with weibo weibo is the chinese translation for microblog rather than the original it does not appear but also chinese social media is really changing chinese mindsets they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard we had a petition system it 's a remedy outside so that 's why the petitioner want to take the train to beijing to petition to the central government they want the emperor to settle the problem they also cause the risk of a revolution but now so i call it the weibo petition people just use their cell phones to tweet she is the most popular microblogger in china who they 're almost like a national tv station if you so a sad story will be picked up by her still gave the chinese a real chance it is like the first time a public sphere chinese people start to learn how to negotiate the cat the censorship is not sleeping it 's so hard to post some sensitive words on the chinese weibo for example you can 't post the name of the president and also you can 't post the city of chongqing the name and until recently you can 't search the surname of top top leaders so the chinese are very good at these puns and they even name themselves you know use the name of this battle between the grass mud horse and the river crab when some very political exciting moments happened you can see on weibo weird phrases and words even if you have a phd of chinese language you can 't understand them but you can 't even expand more no because chinese sina weibo when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter com that means from the very beginning anything you want to post like get together or meet up or walk it is automatically recorded and data mined so they can use the but i want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse the cat is the censorship but chinese is not only one cat so even that so these three years past three years social movements about maybe the question is not about why ten million criticisms in it 's never happened before very big news he 's a princeling but from february to so this kind of freedom is a targeted something you find is freedom something will happen behind it because he was a very popular leftist leader so the central government wanted to purge him and he was very cute he convinced so weibo the three hundred million public sphere because he mobilized millions of chinese people in the cultural revolution to they just give them a target window to not censor people so that 's the update about this game cat and mouse social media changed chinese mindset more and more chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright not some imported american privilege preparing for future democracy but it didn 't change the chinese political system the chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions whatever the future is we should fight against the [ cat ] there is not only in china but also in the united states there are some very small cute but bad cats so we chinese fight for our without fear"
