  "transcript": "market based pricing to affect demand and use wireless technologies to dramatically and the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technologies how we can we need to reduce c02 emissions and i am astounded that i 'm standing here to tell you that what are catastrophic effects a three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in fifty percent species extinction and i 'm really worried because when people talk about cars the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking if we started today ten years from now at the end of this window of opportunity those fuel efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent but it 's an example of something called car sharing zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve by the hour and by the day instead of using their own car how does it feel to be a person using a zipcar it means that i pay only for what i need all those hours when a car is sitting idle i 'm not paying for it so here 's a woman that reserved minimia i can drive my and the other remarkable thing is it 's i think the highest status of car ownership not only do i have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that i can have at my beck and call forbid i would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it it 's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn 't have i get all the good stuff and none of the bad so what is the social result of this the social result is that today 's zipcar has one hundred thousand members which is what the average city dweller does they drive five hundred miles a year are they happy the company has been doubling in size ever since i founded it or greater and how is it that people went from the twelve thousand miles a year to five hundred miles it 's because they said it 's eight to ten dollars an hour and sixty five dollars a day if i 'm going to go buy some ice cream do i really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream or maybe i 'll do without maybe i would have bought the ice cream when i did some other errand so people really respond very quickly to it to prices and the last point i want to make is zipcar would never be possible without technology and for me as a service provider i would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything so without these wireless technologies this as a concept could never happen so here 's another example this company is goloco i 'm launching it in about three weeks and i hope to do for ridesharing what i did for car sharing this will apply to people across all of america today and i think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems to completely change how people feel about ridesharing and make that trip much more efficient and so when i think about the future people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone is this incredibly great social event out of their day you know you went with other tedsters how fabulous why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car how did you go food shopping you went with your neighbor what a great social time where can i go today and who can i do it with those are the types of things that you will look at and feel and the social benefits the rate of single occupancy vehicles is i told you seventy five percent i think we can get that that down to fifty percent the demand for parking of course is down congestion and the co2 emissions one last piece about this of course is that it 's enabled by wireless technologies and it 's the cost of driving that 's making people want to be able to do this the average american spends nineteen percent of their income on their car and there 's a pressure for them to reduce that the last example of this is congestion pricing very famously done in london it 's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads in london the day they turned the congestion pricing on and that 's persisted for the four years in which they 've been doing congestion pricing and again do people like the outcome so again we can see that price plays an enormous role in people 's willingness to we 've tripled the miles that we drive since one thousand nine hundred and seventy and doubled them since one thousand nine hundred and eighty two there 's a huge slack in that system with the right pricing we can undo that and what congestion pricing is is that it 's a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing and road pricing is where we 're all going to have to go because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear with gas taxes and as we get our cars more fuel efficient that 's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes so we need to charge people by the by the mile that they drive whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies will be happening with road pricing why do we travel too much car travel is underpriced and therefore we over consumed and if we have it you 'll decide how many miles to drive what mode of travel where to live and work which is when are we going to start doing this this congestion pricing road pricing is coming when are we going to do it are we going to wait ten to fifteen years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years this is my respond to emergencies get traffic moving provide a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce co2 emissions in every sector this moment you guys are going to be the handsome young guy and i 'm going to be the wise businessman i want to say one word to you just one word these are also called mesh networks and in a mesh every device contributes to and expands the network and i think you might have heard a little bit about it before i 'm going to give you some examples you 'll be hearing later today from alan kay zero dollars a month video cameras were mesh enabled so that they could monitor crime in the downtown french quarter when the hurricane happened the only communication system standing was the mesh network volunteers flew in added a whole bunch of devices and for the next twelve months mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening three hundred buses and they speak to these smart terminals you can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street you can have these very highly scalable you can just keep adding them and as in katrina you can keep subtracting them as long as there 's some we can still communicate they 're resilient their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design what are the incredible weaknesses there isn 't anybody in washington lobbying to make it happen or in those municipalities build out their cities with these wireless networks because there 's zero ongoing communications cost so the examples that i gave you are these islands of mesh networks and networks are interesting only as they are big how do we create a big network are you guys ready again the graduate this time you will still play the handsome young thing but i 'll be the sexy woman these are the next two lines in the movie where did you do it so you know when you stick this idea where would we expect me robin chase to be thinking we could have a free wireless communication i guess i just want you to think about that because we 're going to do congestion pricing we are going to do road tolls gas taxes are going to become road pricing these things are going to happen maybe we should use a good one maybe we shouldn 't wait for the ten or fifteen years for this to happen we should pull it forward we 're creating these wireless devices i guess you guys might have fast pass here or easy lane that are single purpose devices in these closed networks what is the point we 're transferring just a few little data bits when we 're doing road controlling road pricing we have this incredible excess capacity so we can provide the lowest cost means of going wireless coast to coast we can have resilient nationwide communication systems we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero what you can do with that tool we can create an economic engine information should be free and access to information should be and we should be charging people for carbon and this open source version means that it could be if we did a brilliant job of it it could be could be used around the world very quickly so going back to one of my earlier thoughts imagine if every one of these buses in lagos when i went this morning to larry brilliant 's tedtalk prize imagine if and we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source"
