  "transcript": "that 's probably more than at any time many of you will object for you this would be a more appropriate map you could call it tedistan for them now this is important because border conflicts justify so much of and we can try to anticipate those changes and shape them in a more constructive direction the present and some maps you haven 't seen in order to get a sense of where things are going let 's start with the world of then over the late then came the end of the cold war and the ' stans of central asia today we have two hundred countries in the world independent eastern eurasia as you can see on this map and as you know china is the most populous and they share a lengthy land border what you don 't see on this map and only thirty million people are in its eastern areas in fact the world bank predicts that russia 's population is declining towards about one hundred and twenty million people and there is another thing that you don 't see on this khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags labor camps nuclear cities whatever the case was but as oil prices rose because the people in the east who never wanted to be there anyway have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west because in chinese firms operate and own most of the mines copper zinc gold and they truck the resources south and east into mainland china china but in fact with global warming and rising temperatures all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness and grain being produced in siberia that 's larger than the entire population of russia crossing moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain china isn 't it 's just leasing it now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in ten to twenty but hold on this map is seven hundred years old but it does rhyme because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography so the history so let 's look at how china is re establishing that hierarchy in the far east it starts with the global hubs remember the forty dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global then there is trade these vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that china has with every country in the region specifically it targets japan and korea korea and australia countries that are strong allies of the united states australia for example is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to china and now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to china to lead the rebound the economic rebound not so china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy china has signed military agreements with many countries in the has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the east asian community some of these organizations don 't even have the united states as a member another pillar of the strategy like russia is demographic teachers to teach chinese around the region to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies already ethnic chinese people in thailand and indonesia are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there chinese pride is resurgent in the region now it encourages it if you add it all up what do you get if you remember before world war ii japan had a vision for a greater japanese co prosperity sphere what 's emerging today is what you might call a greater chinese co prosperity sphere so no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders what you really have emerging in the far east are national cultures but in a much more fluid imperial zone so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world what lines on the map should we focus on what i want to present to you is what i call state building day by day let 's start with iraq six years after the u s invasion of iraq the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality now it is the most significant cause of the country 's disintegration the reason is kurdistan the kurds for three thousand years have been waging a struggle for independence and now is their chance to finally have it these are pipeline routes which emerge from kurdistan which is and today if you go to kurdistan you 'll see that kurdish peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the sunni iraqi army no it 's the pipelines now should we be upset about this about the potential disintegration of i don 't believe we should iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world behind saudi arabia it has no choice but to behave now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region that is of course in palestine thirty years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict what might i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure today donors are spending billions of dollars on this these two arrows are an arc an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the west bank and gaza if gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the west bank you can have a viable palestinian state palestinian economy without infrastructure the last time that was the case was actually a century ago during the ottoman empire on the mediterranean sea ruins infrastructure that cross the straight lines the borders the former soviet republics of central asia the ' stans these countries ' borders originate from stalin 's decrees he purposely did not want these countries to make sense he wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule now i know some of you may be thinking oil oil oil why is it all he 's talking about is oil now it 's their oil for their own purposes and i assure you it 's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades a great deal of them for a number of countries in this part of the world having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves just take azerbaijan azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the caucuses but now with the which most people think of as a frozen basket case and even a potentially because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the caspian and even east to china more pipelines means more silk roads instead of the great game the great game connotes dominance of one over the other road connotes independence the more pipelines we have the more silk roads we 'll have and the less of a dominant great game competition we 'll have in the 21st century and that is of course europe the european union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries and their main purpose was really to and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world on average the e u has grown by one country per year since the end of the cold war in fact most of that happened on just one day in two thousand and four well in light blue you see the zones or the regions that are at least two thirds or more dependent on the european union for trade trade and investment what does that tell us trade and investment tell us that europe is putting its money where its mouth is but you can get on a german ice train and make it almost to albania in bosnia you use the euro currency already and that 's the only currency they 're probably ever going to have so looking at other parts of europe 's periphery that not only helps europe diminish its reliance on russia for energy but if you travel to north africa today you 'll hear more and more people saying that they don 't really think of their region as the middle east so in other words i believe that president sarkozy of france is right when he talks about a mediterranean union now let 's look at turkey and the caucasus i mentioned azerbaijan before so what 's next where are we going to see borders change and new countries born south west asia is a very good place to start pakistan and afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of pashtun nationalism this is the flag that flies in the minds of twenty million pashtuns who live on both sides of the afghan and pakistan border let 's not neglect the insurgency just to the south balochistan two weeks ago balochi rebels attacked a pakistani military garrison and this was the flag that they raised over it and i expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment of course we can 't forget africa if we were to look at all of africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more tribal divisions which you all know about the civil war in the east of the country and south sudan south sudan is going to be having a referendum in two thousand and eleven in which it is very likely to now let 's go up to the arctic circle there is a great race on for energy resources under the arctic seabed who will win canada russia the united states actually greenland several weeks ago greenland 's [ sixty thousand ] people voted themselves self governance rights from denmark so denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller now we fear changes on the map we fear civil wars death tolls having to learn the names of new countries but i believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today today is far worse and far more violent"
