  "transcript": "fresh out of college i went to work for a consulting firm he told us nave i really was at the time i will do everything i 'm told i will be easy to manage it wasn 't until i arrived in graduate school and witnessed firsthand the criminal actions of scientists and engineers in the water crisis in flint michigan that i realized how dangerous and yet surprisingly common this line of thinking really is including thousands of young children were exposed to contaminated drinking water with high levels of lead lead is a potent neurotoxin causes cognitive and developmental disabilities and is especially harmful to growing fetuses and young children we 've known about its dangers since the roman empire twelve people died by contracting legionnaires ' disease flint 's water infrastructure the complex network of underground pipes has been and while the water quality is slowly improving and the pipes are being replaced now more than two years later the water is still not safe to drink so people are still in shock they ask themselves how could this have happened the short answer is the crisis began when an emergency manager but it continued for so long because scientists and engineers at government agencies in the state of michigan and in the federal government did not follow federal regulations for treating the water right what was more they actively cheated on the law and orchestrated while publicly insisting that the brown smelly water coming out of the tap was safe to drink the system at the local state and federal levels completely failed to protect our most vulnerable and an entire population was left to fend for itself amidst this injustice flint residents were rallying together amongst them were some amazing women of flint mothers concerned about their kids who came together forming and these groups started protesting and demanding change amongst them was a guy named miguel epa the environmental protection agency who actually wrote this scientific memo he was characterized a rogue employee and silenced in collaboration with flint residents our research team here at tech conducted citywide testing to prove that flint 's water was indeed contaminated even toxic in some homes when i was getting involved when i said yes to this i had no idea what i was getting into but every second of this journey has been totally worth it journalists and scientists came together to uncover the truth using science advocacy and activism pediatrician figured out that the instances of childhood lead poisoning had indeed doubled in flint during the crisis and the state of michigan was forced to acknowledge the problem and take steps to correct it this group and many others got flint 's kids protected and now flint is getting more than six hundred million dollars in healthcare nutrition education the arrogance and the callous disregard for public health shown by scientists and engineers at these government agencies is beyond belief these unhealthy cultures that are festering in these groups where the focus is on meeting regulations and checking boxes as opposed to protecting public health is just appalling just consider this email that an epa employee wrote where she goes i 'm not so sure flint is a community we want to go out on a limb for contrast that to in my opinion should be the first law of humanity let alone screw up people can get hurt buried deep in history lies a character i deeply admire an engineer named peter palchinsky he lived in the time of the soviet union and palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble for his radical honesty and willingness to point out major flaws in the soviets ' mindless pursuit of rapid industrialization anyone asking questions or offering feedback was the soviets had created the largest army of engineers the world had ever seen and yet most of them were mere cogs in a gigantic machine heading for doom palchinsky on the other hand implored engineers to look at the economic political and social consequences of their actions in other words be more his fearless voice of reason was seen as a threat to the political establishment and stalin had him executed in one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine palchinsky 's view on technocrats is very different from one that is still very popular still very common that of a dispassionate researcher working in his ivory tower lab brilliant no doubt shows little emotion this guy thank goodness i can 't be i was reminded of this distinction because a recent article came out in a very reputed which kind of characterized our flint work as driven by youthful idealism and hollywood 's dramatic sensibilities it and if you think you have to get try finding an activist group or an ngo and obtain the full support of the academic community whatever that means before you get involved not one mention of our moral and professional obligation of preventing harm to the public or the fact that we have all this expertise and for some even tenure but to denounce this idea this possibility so completely so that you can protect research the ideals we would want to pass to our students and so you may think ok all this sounds great but you 'll never completely change organizational cultures or imbibe mindsets in students and professionals to look at their work as a public good science in service to the public could a big reason for that be that we are not training our students right because if you look closely our education system today is focused more on creating what and yet we somehow spend most of our time during high school and college just jumping through hoops and doing things rsum instead of sitting down and reflecting on what we want to do and who we want there is also a growing culture of disengagement between engineering students we are trained to build bridges and solve complex problems but not how to think or live or a citizen of this world maybe so or building character or discerning right from wrong consider this project that i deeply love and admire famous for the stanford prison experiment this program seeks to these young minds work over time to develop skills and virtues so that when the opportunity comes no matter what that opportunity be to stand up and do the right thing anyone can be a hero think about that idea for a second why don 't we teach science and engineering like that where heroism and public service are seen as key values because indeed it 's often heroism that is not only the antidote to public sciences so that they can serve society and are also aware of the tremendous power their knowledge and decisions have and who realize that conflict and controversy are not necessarily bad things if our ultimate loyalty is to the these are the people who will stand up like we did in flint not to be saviors or heroes in the media but imagine fostering such a public focused mindset in policy making or even becoming the president of a country some of mankind 's greatest challenges lie ahead of us contaminated drinking water is just one example we could definitely use more nay we desperately need more compassionate upstanders and thank you"
