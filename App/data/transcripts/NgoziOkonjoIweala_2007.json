  "transcript": "but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this and i don 't have any smart technology for you to look at there are no slides so you 'll just have to be content with me what i want to do this morning is already this morning there were some allusions to the africa that you hear about all the time the africa of hiv while and this is the africa that is changing that chris alluded to and this is the africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this and i want to start by telling you a story about that change in africa on 15th of september two thousand and five a governor of one of the oil rich states of nigeria was arrested by the london metropolitan police he was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him this arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the london metropolitan police and the economic and financial crimes commission of nigeria led by one of our most alamieyeseigha was arraigned in london due to some slip ups he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where according to our constitution those in office but what happened people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office today alams as we call him for short is in jail this is a story about the fact that people in africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders this is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good and not taken out to places where they 'll benefit just a few and therefore when you hear about the corrupt africa corruption all the time i want you to know that the people and the governments does it mean the problem is over the answer is no so when you hear about corruption feel that is not the case there 's a will to fight and in many countries that fight is ongoing and is being won the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to but the the truth of the matter is that this is going on the results are showing independent monitoring by the world bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption and governance is improving a study by the economic commission for africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in and let me say just one more thing before i leave this area of governance but let me say this if alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in london if the other people who had taken money estimated at twenty to forty billion now of developing countries ' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries if they 're able to do this what is that so when we talk about this kind of corruption let us also think about what is happening on the side of the globe where the money 's going and what can be done to stop it i 'm working on an initiative now along with the world bank on asset recovery trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad developing countries ' moneys to get that sent back because if we can get the twenty billion dollars sitting out there back it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together the second thing i want to talk about is the will for reform after they 're tired we 're tired of being the subject of everybody 's charity and can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform we have to do it we can invite partners who can support us but we have to start we have to reform our economies change our leadership become more be more open to change and to information and this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries and it has one hundred and forty million dynamic people chaotic people and with the support of a leader who was willing at the time to do the reforms we put forward a comprehensive reform program which we developed ourselves not the international monetary fund not the world bank where i worked for twenty one years and rose to be a vice no one can do it for you you have to do it for yourself we put together a program that would one get the state out of businesses it had nothing so we decided to privatize many of our enterprises as a result we decided to liberalize many of our markets can you believe that prior to this reform which started at the end of two thousand and three when i left washington to go and take up the post of finance minister we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop four thousand five hundred landlines in its entire 30 year a telephone in my country was a huge luxury you couldn 't get it you had to bribe you had to do everything to get your phone when president obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector we went from four thousand five hundred landlines and except a few smart people the smartest one first to come in was the mtn company of south the three years that i was finance minister they made an average of three hundred and sixty million dollars profit per year three hundred and sixty million so the market is there when they kept this under wraps but soon others got to know but there 's a huge market out there so privatization is one of the things we 've done the other thing we 've also done is to manage our finances because nobody 's going to help you and support you and nigeria with the oil sector had the reputation so what did we try to do we introduced a fiscal rule that de linked our budget from the oil price before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in because oil is the biggest most revenue earning sector in the economy seventy percent of our revenues come from oil we de linked that and once we did it we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price we didn 't know we could pull it off it was very but what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development where even if oil prices were high we would grow very fast when they crashed we crashed and we could hardly even pay anything any salaries in the economy and this went to our reserves when i arrived in two thousand and three we had seven billion dollars in reserves we have about forty billion dollars in reserves due to makes it stable our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have we brought inflation down from twenty eight percent to about eleven percent and we had gdp grow from an average of two point three percent the previous decade to about six and what is more important because we want to get away from oil and diversify and there are so many opportunities in this one big country as in many countries in africa and i could go on and on and this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro economy straightened out the opportunities in various other sectors we have opportunities in agriculture like i said we have opportunities in solid so we 've now got a mining code we have opportunities in housing and real estate there was nothing in a country of one hundred and forty million people no shopping malls as you know this was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people and now we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected we had eighty nine banks too many not doing their real business we by requiring that they increase their capital share capital and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside barclays bank of the u k is bringing in five hundred and i can go on dollars on and on into the system we are doing the same with the insurance sector so in financial services a great deal of opportunity in tourism in many african countries but managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people so what am i trying to say i 'm trying to tell you that there 's a new wave on the continent a new wave of openness and democratization in which since two thousand more than two thirds of african countries have democratic elections not all of them have been perfect or will is very clear i 'm trying to tell you that since the past three years so it 's clear that things are changing conflicts are down on the continent from about twelve conflicts a decade ago we are down to three or four conflicts one of the most terrible of course of which is darfur but you should know that this continent is not is a continent of many countries and if we are down to three or four conflicts it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in growing exciting economies and i want to just make one point about this investment the best way to help africans today and the best way to do that is by helping create jobs there 's no issue with fighting malaria but imagine the impact on a family if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves if we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet isn 't that a wonderful opportunity isn 't that the way to go and i want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women 'm sorry that i didn 't say anything on time otherwise i would have liked you to have seen this it says africa open for business and this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year understand that the woman who made it is going to be in tanzania where they 're having the but it shows you africans and particularly african women who against all odds have developed businesses some of them world class one of the women in this video adenike ogunlesi making children 's clothes which she started as a hobby mixing african materials such as we have with make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys with african material mixed in very creative designs has reached a stage where she even had an order from wal mart so that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing and the women are diligent they are focused they work hard i could go on giving examples beatrice gakuba of rwanda who opened up a flower business and is now exporting however many of these are starved for capital to expand because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do so if you want to think about the of this world who are doing incredible things so i invite you to explore the opportunities when listen carefully because i 'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent for the people and for yourselves"
