  "transcript": "my topic is economic growth in china and india and the question i want to explore with you you may say this is not fair actually the first question there is why china has grown so much faster than india the last thirty years in terms of the gdp growth rates china has grown at twice the rate of india china undoubtedly has done much one simple answer is china has shanghai and india has mumbai it can plan for the long term benefits of the country even prime minister manmohan singh agrees with that view in an that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic bridges things like that and you need also state ownership especially of land assets in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly the implication here 's the key question just how important then you would argue a strong government is if you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe then you will put less emphasis on strong government and for the sake of brevity i 'll call one country country one and the other country country two country one has a systematic advantage over country two in infrastructures so if i were to ask you and which country has grown faster if you believe in the infrastructure and country two is possibly and the data referred to one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine after the country reported very impressive the country that 's not too good the picture there is khrushchev i know that in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine he no longer ruled the soviet union but that 's the best picture that i can find country two that has fewer telephones is china you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades this is a very little known fact about the two countries until the late 1990s china had an infrastructure disadvantage vis a vis india the most common mode of transportation is the railways and the british built a lot of railways in india india is the smaller of the two the evidence is more supportive of the view that are actually the result of economic growth infrastructure let me look at this question more directly is democracy bad for economic growth now let 's turn to two countries a and country b country a in one thousand nine hundred and ninety had about $ three hundred per capita gdp as compared with country b which had $ four hundred and sixty in per capita gdp $ seven hundred per capita gdp as compared with $ six hundred and fifty per capita gdp both and which one is a democracy you may argue well maybe and country b is pakistan the country that has a long period of military rule that 's because the two countries have but the more natural comparison is actually between india and pakistan but shared common history by that comparison democracy looks very so why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments one reason is the east asian model taiwan hong kong and the problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries have you won the lottery we have won the lottery and then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are one hundred percent the reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn 't end up winning the prize burma if you look at the statistical evidence worldwide so the east asian model has this massive selection bias it is known as selecting on a dependent variable something we always tell our so exactly why did china and compare that country 's performance with india under indira gandhi the question there is which country did better it turns out even during the cultural the whole country went mad it must mean that the country had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth to overcome the negative effects of the cultural revolution the advantage the country had was human capital this is the world development index indicator data the adult literacy rate in china is between chinese women and indian women i haven 't told you about the definition of literacy the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write one thousand five hundred chinese characters the definition of literacy operating definition of the grand ability to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak 1970s so if you have a choice between being a chinese and being an indian you would want to become a chinese if you made that decision in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five the down side of that is the next year we have the cultural revolution so you have to always think carefully about these because as an indian man you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis a vis indian women it 's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern it shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the indian society against women the good news is by two thousand and six india has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life today indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over indian men so india is reverting to the normal but india still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality these are the two pictures taken of garment factories in guangdong province and garment factories whereas in india it 's all men financial times printed this picture of an indian textile factory with the title india poised to overtake china in textile if you look at other east asian countries women there play a what about the political system isn 't it true that the actually the answer statically china is a one party system authoritarian there 's no question about you use other things that have changed to explain sometimes a fixed effect with the things that change and they have increased the there is also a rural because india was growing at a hindu rate of growth about one percent two percent a year that was when india was least democratic indira gandhi declared emergency rule in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five the indian government owned and operated all the tv stations a little known fact about india in the 1990s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self rule privatization of media so the dynamic perspective fits both with china and in india in terms of the direction why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster one reason is but that doesn 't mean that you 're a bad basketball player if you compare india with the developing country even before the more recent period of acceleration of indian growth now india is growing between eight and nine percent even before this period india was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies this is a very impressive record indeed the elephant which country has the growth momentum but i believe that india has the the direction it is moving in is the right direction i believe that the political reforms are a must for to maintain its growth and i don 't know whether that 's going to happen or not but i 'm an optimist hopefully thank you very much"
