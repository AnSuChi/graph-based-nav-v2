  "transcript": "so this is a start now this quest started four billion years ago on planet earth there 's been four billion years of organic biological life and as an inorganic chemist my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic living world and the inorganic dead world and what i 'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic dead matter into living matter into inorganic biology but within that infrastructure we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from and evolution although it was established well over one hundred years ago by charles darwin and a vast number of other people evolution still is a little bit intangible and so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way think about evolution in terms of offspring competing and some what is the minimal unit so when i thought about it then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer so this raises three really important questions what is life is biology special biologists seem to think so if we can answer that then we 're going to know how special biology is and maybe just maybe maybe we 'll have some idea of what life really is and you can see it 's kind of pollinating germinating growing of course they 're not alive but when i saw this i was really fascinated because it seemed lifelike and let 's go one step further let 's see if we can actually make life but there 's a problem because i wanted to say hang on what is going on here is life let we have such amazing a serious question if your pen but before we can make life let 's think for a second what life really is characterized by and the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing synthetic biologists are manipulating it catalysts but what else is life and so we have to understand that if we 're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life we need to power it somehow from and darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere maybe not in scotland maybe in africa maybe somewhere else vast chemical soup of stuff we then got to the last ancestor evolution kicked and that 's the cool bit and here we are but we can 't get further than the last ancestor the last visible cell that we could so we don 't know so there are two intelligent design direct and indirect so god or now talking about e t putting us there or some other life just pushes the problem further on i 'm not a politician i 'm a scientist and somehow so in the they took the basic ingredients put them in a single jar and ignited them and it got reignited in the ' 80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on in my own laboratory the way we 're trying to create so what we 're trying to do is do reactions not in one flask but in tens of flasks and connect them together as you can see with this flow system all these pipes we can do it microfluidically we can do it lithographically we can do it in a 3d printer we can do it in droplets for colleagues but so we need to be a bit more focused and the answer of course lies with mice this is how i remember what i need as a chemist i say well i want molecules so if you have a container it 's like getting and i 'm going to drive around and show off my car and i imagine you have a similar thing in cellular biology with the emergence of life so these things together but these are a simple kit there 's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present and we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nano molecular molecules we need to make some containers and just a few months ago in my lab we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them and you can see on the screen a and all i wanted to show you is we can set up molecules in membranes in real cells and then it sets up a kind of molecular darwinism a molecular survival of the and this movie here shows this competition between molecules molecules are competing for stuff they and that is the key let 's zoom out to what that could mean to us if we could get evolution into the material world then i propose we should have a general theory of evolution and that 's really worth thinking about does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution so you imagine if we 're able to create a self sustaining artificial life form not only will this tell us about the origin of life that it 's possible that the universe doesn 't need carbon to be alive it can use anything we can then take [ it ] one step further and develop new technologies because we can then use software control for evolution to code in so imagine we make a little cell we want to put it out in the environment and we want it to be powered by the sun biology doesn 't care about the design unless it works so this will reorganize the way we design things wouldn 't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn 't really deal with the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand because it 's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution evolution cannot be cut apart and we really start talking about selfish matter and what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff you 're sitting on chairs for i want to keep away from and we can make matter become evolvable thank you very much once we 've set up the right chemistry ca and when do you think that will happen lc hopefully within the next two years ca that would be a big story in your own mind what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is if you take away carbon there 's other things that can happen so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon maybe we can tell nasa what really to look for don 't go and look for carbon go and look for evolvable stuff"
