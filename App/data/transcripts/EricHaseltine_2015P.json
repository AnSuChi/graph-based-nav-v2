  "transcript": "i 'm talking i 'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this i say might because with revolutionary ideas most are flat wrong and even those that are right seldom have the impact that we want them to have to explain why i picked two ideas in particular i 'm going to start with a mystery women were dying of high fevers soon after giving birth three times more often at one of the clinics than at the other trying to figure out what the difference was that caused this semmelweis looked at everything he could sanitation the puzzle went unsolved until he happened to autopsy a doctor who died of an infected scalpel cut the doctor 's symptoms were identical to those of the mothers who were dying how was that possible how could a male doctor get the same thing as new mothers semmelweis reconstructed everything the doctor had done right before he got sick gotten in his wound that killed him with growing excitement and he found it it turned out that at the hospital with the high death rate but not the others so he ordered the doctors to sterilize their hands and the deaths stopped and had for hundreds of years that odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease not these hypothetical particles that you couldn 't see it took twenty years for frenchman louis pasteur to prove that semmelweis was right he found that bacteria were the culprits we saw it with semmelweis that he was a revolutionary we 'd known since the 1680s about bacteria we just didn 't know that bacteria killed people and he also demolished fond ideas that people kept close to their heart miasmas didn 't kill people bacteria killed people and the other let 's get started with dr eric betzig he 's a physicist who has opened our eyes to an entirely new world by violating the laws of physics he quit a job at prestigious bell laboratory inventing new microscopes for biology because he thought scientists were taking his brilliant inventions and doing lousy work with them he never lost his passion for figuring out how to get microscopes to see finer and finer details than had ever been seen before or ever could be seen this is crucial if we 're ever going to understand and how something the size of a head of a pin can do all these amazing things like make proteins and move charges around and all of those things and part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit the diffraction limit is kind of like when you go to a doctor 's office you can only see so far down no matter how good glasses you have this was a but one of betzig 's friends figured out how to take a tiny molecule that was smaller than the best microscope could see and get it to light up and fluoresce aha betzig said i think maybe the laws of physics are not so unbreakable after all so he lashed together a microscope he had no laboratory this revolutionary instrument got different protein molecules to light up in different colors and with a computer he was able to turn very very fuzzy eric betzig won the nobel prize why because now we can see with unprecedented detail things that we never had seen before doctors can get a better handle on things like cancer but do you think betzig was satisfied there he wanted movies the he came up with a idea so the way that works is if you take two very very fine patterns and you move them across each other you will see a gross pattern that a microscope can see and here is the full of strange things zipping around doing things that we don 't know what they 're doing but when we figure it out we 'll have a better handle clathrins they 're molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell unfortunately viruses sometimes hijack those to infect cells also you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around those are actin molecules unfortunately viruses also climb down those things to get into the cell nucleus to replicate themselves and make you sick we have a much better chance of curing viral diseases so when you look at a movie like this it 's very but he hasn 't shattered any cherished beliefs that leads us to dr aubrey de grey at cambridge now most scientists think he 's a crackpot when we eat we take in food and we metabolize it and that throws off what we call free radicals you might have heard of those also known as oxygen ions those bind to our dna cause it to mutate and cause us to get old and lose our hair it 's just like no it 's exactly like oxygen binding to iron and making it rust so you age because rust out and scientists also know there is something called immortality so if you stop aging all of you but could de grey be on to something i have and he has published some very significant work on mitochondrial dna and a bunch of other stuff secondly he started an antiaging foundation that has identified seven different causes of and he is hot in pursuit of fixes for every single one of them he believes and he 's made a convincing case that using viruses we can do gene therapy fix that dna and rejuvenate our cells we have an existent proof that extreme bristlecone pine trees live five thousand years and some lobsters don 't age at all now this doesn 't mean that de grey is going to revolutionize our lifespans i mean after all we 're not trees and most of us are not but i 've got to believe that there are darwins and einsteins out there and i consider this there are seven times more people alive today than during darwin 's time and i do believe that there 's one of them out there thank you"
