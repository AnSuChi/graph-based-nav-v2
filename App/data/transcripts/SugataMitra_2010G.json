  "transcript": "but you 're sitting here i think you 'll realize you could draw little circles to say these are places where good teachers won 't go so we have an ironic problem good teachers don 't want to go to just those places where they 're i basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in new delhi and they didn 't know what the internet was i connected high speed internet to it it 's about three but i repeated this all over india and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do this is the first experiment that we did eight on your right this boy here in the middle of central india where the children recorded their own music they did all of this in another south indian village these fourteen days after putting the computer in their so at the end of it we concluded irrespective of who or where they were at that point i became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer we started off with an i gave a group of children they spoke english with a very strong telugu accent i gave them a computer with interface which you now get free with windows so they said well it doesn 't understand anything of what we are saying so i said yeah i 'll leave it here for two two months later and this is now documented in the information technology for international development journal that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral british accent in which i had trained the speech to text synthesizer in other words they were all speaking like james tooley so they could do that on their own after that i started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own i got an interesting phone call once from columbo from the late arthur i want to see what 's going on and he couldn 't travel so i went over there he said two interesting things a teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be the second thing he said was that if children have interest then education happens and i was doing that in the field so every time i would watch it this is a fifteen rural cambodia a fairly silly arithmetic game which no child would play inside the classroom or at home they would you know throw it back at you they 'd say this is very boring if you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away then they will show off with each other about what this is what these children are doing they are trying to multiply i think at the end of about two years children were beginning to google their homework as a result the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their english rapid improvement and all sorts of things so on and so forth i decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own a large amount of money had come into newcastle university pounds worth of university money sitting in delhi so in two thousand and six i bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to newcastle i wanted to test the limits of the system the first experiment i did out of newcastle was actually done in india and i set myself and impossible target can tamil speaking children in a south indian village and i thought i 'll test them they 'll get a zero we need teachers for certain things i called in twenty six children they all came in there and i told them that there 's some really difficult stuff on this computer i wouldn 't be surprised if you didn 't understand anything and i 'm going so i left them with it i came back after two how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing they said we look at it every day from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes genetic disease we 've understood nothing else it took me three years to publish that it 's just been published in the british journal of educational technology one of the referees who refereed the paper said it 's too good to be and then that 's her over there and they played football with her i asked that girl would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass and she said how would i do that i don 't know the subject i said no use the method of the grandmother she said what 's that i said well what you 've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time so i came back to newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious so having experimented in all sorts of remote places i came to the most remote place that i could think of five thousand miles from delhi is the little town of gateshead in gateshead i i said you make your own groups of four each group of four can use one computer and not four computers remember from the hole in the wall you can go to another group peer over their shoulders see what they 're doing come back to you own group and claim it as your own work what do you want us to do i gave them six gcse questions the first group the best one solved everything in twenty minutes let 's try it i 'll come back after two months we 'll give them a paper test no computers no talking to each other etc the score was seventy six percent there was photographic recall inside the children i suspect because they 're discussing with each other a single child in front of a single computer will not do that because their teachers say that after the session is over the children continue to google further here in britain i after my kuppam experiment you know they 're very vigorous people british grandmothers two hundred of them volunteered immediately laughter the deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time sitting in so they did that and over the last two years over six hundred hours of instruction has happened over skype using what my students call the granny cloud the granny cloud sits over there i can beam them to whichever school i want to girl gets into the heart of you know stuff which i don 't know anything about two children watch a tedtalk they wanted to be footballers before after watching eight tedtalks he wants to become leonardo da vinci big broadband connections this is a sole in newcastle the mediator is from pune india year old students i started writing english questions on the blackboard well do it they typed it into google translated it into italian went back into italian google later next question where is calcutta this one they took only ten minutes i tried a really hard one then who was pythagoras and what did he do there was silence for a while then they said you 've spelled it wrong it 's pitagora and then in twenty minutes the right angled triangles began to appear these are ten system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside which is that the system starts to do things which it was never designed for which is why you i think i can make a guess now education is self organizing system where learning is an emergent phenomenon it there is a method available we need one hundred million mediators there are many more than that on the planet we could change everything thanks"
