  "transcript": "which goes the truth will set you so with that in mind i 'm going to set about trying to do those things here and talk about dying in the 21st century now the first thing that will piss you off undoubtedly is that all of us are in fact going to die in the 21st century there will be no exceptions to that there are apparently about one in eight of you who think you 're immortal going to happen while i give this talk in the next ten minutes a hundred million of my cells will die and over the course of today two thousand of my brain cells will die and never come back so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece anyway the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century apart from going to happen to everybody is it 's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it 's currently on so there you go that 's the truth no doubt that will piss you off and now let 's see whether we can set you free i don 't promise anything and i think i 've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care it 's been a ride man this has been fantastic we have machines that go ping there 's many of them up there so we have had tremendous success and we we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit and we started using expressions like and what 's really happened over the period of time that i 've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to so what 's happening now is there 's been a big shift in the way that people die and most of what they 're dying of now isn 't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when i was doing this in the ' 80s and ' we kind of got a bit caught up with this and we haven 't really squared with you guys about what 's really happening now and it 's about time we did i kind of woke up to this bit in the late ' 90s when i met this guy this guy and he looked like this i was called down to the ward to see him his is the little hand his daughter 's here and she wants everything possible to be done and he is indeed and he 's too sick to talk to me so i talk to his daughter kathleen and i say to her did you and jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation and she looked at me and said no of course not i thought okay take this steady and i got talking to her and after a while she said to me you know we always thought there 'd be time jim was ninety four there wasn 't this dialogue going on that i imagined was happening so a group of us started doing survey work and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle in the newcastle area and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating in a hundred and only one in five hundred of them had plan about what to do if they became seriously ill and i realized of course this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large now i work in acute care this is john hunter hospital and i thought surely we do better so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die and we didn 't find a single record of any preference about goals treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient so we started to realize that we had a problem and the the problem is more serious because of this what we know is but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards how we die lives and the stress created in families by dying is enormous and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else so dying in intensive care is not your top option if if you 've got a choice and if that wasn 't bad enough all of this so this is the sort of momentum that we 've got at the moment the reason why this is all happening is due to this and i do have to take you through what this is about these are the four ways to go so one of these will happen to all of us the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest sudden death it the dying process of those with terminal illness that we 've just seen occurs are these what you die of is increasing organ failure whatever organs packing up each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital and this one 's the biggest growth industry of all and at least six out of ten of the people in this room will die in this form which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty and the last few years or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability unfortunately enjoying it so far feel such a i feel such a cassandra here laughter now we are all most of us living to to reach this point you know historically we didn 't do that this is what happens to you and unfortunately increasing longevity does mean more old age not more youth i 'm sorry to say we didn 't just take this lying down at john hunter hospital and elsewhere which is clearly the separation of death from the living and the fear like if you actually look there 's one woman there we had a major cultural issue clearly people didn 't want us to talk about death or we thought that we trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die and what would they prefer under those circumstances they loved it the families and the patients they loved it ninety eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice and that this is how things should work and when they expressed wishes all of those wishes came true as it were we were able to make that happen for them so here 's the pitch i think it 's important there has to be a little side road off there for people who don 't want to go on that track and and this is the small idea the small idea is let 's all of us engage more with this in the way that jason has illustrated why can 't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this there are a couple of things you can do one of them is you can just ask this simple question this question never fails event that you became too sick to speak for yourself who would you like to speak for you that 's a really important question to ask people because giving people the control over who that is the second thing you can say is have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we 've got a better idea of what it the big idea i think is more political i think we have to get onto this i suggested we should have occupy death my wife said yeah right sit ins in the mortuary yeah yeah sure i don 't know i don 't think i look like that anymore but i had two of my kids were born at home in so if you just replace all these all these words of birth i like peace love natural death as an option i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which i actually think that that in places like oregon where you can have physician assisted suicide you take a but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all the last year of your life"
