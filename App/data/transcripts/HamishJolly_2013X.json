  "transcript": "the kind that can potentially save lives can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover in the evolved accumulated body of human anecdote for example or in the time tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us and when we do the results will often surprise western australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years but western australia is not alone in this the incident of and so it 's not surprising perhaps that in july of this year shark attack mitigation systems in collaboration with the university of western australia oceans institute made an announcement which captured the and i have for you today the story of that journey but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention when we began this process we were looking it was about three years ago and we 'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in in western australia who most australians would know is a famous naturalist had spent a lot of time in the marine environment harry butler is a precursor if you like to the late steve irwin when i asked him about and you 'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species and it wasn 't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened and it caused and it turns out the web is awash with so biologically there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns warning patterns to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark on the human side walter starck an oceanographer has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s and so what 's going on here is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to to consider we know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack the idea that there 's a kernel of truth thought to be important passed down from generation to generation i wanted to put some science to this because if science could support this concept then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack right under our very nose to do that i needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology and a worldwide search again and professor nathan hart and his team had just written a paper so i called up nathan a and fortunately he thought that was a good so what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the west australian state government and we did three key things the first is that we tiger and bull shark the next thing we did was to understand complex computer modeling what that eye can see and water clarity and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that and to that end i invited ray smith a surfer industrial designer wetsuit designer and in fact the guy that designed the original quiksilver logo to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into and potentially even create confusion for the shark and this one 's configured to go with a a surfboard you can see that dark opaque panel on the front and it 's particularly better for the surface where being backlit and providing a silhouette second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column and in any given conditions one or more of those panels will match the and this one 's particularly well suited to the dive configuration so when you 're deeper under the water so we knew that we had some really solid science here we knew if you wanted to stand out you needed to look stripy and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic but the acid test is always going to be how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes and testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think laughter so we 're ethically precluded from initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks the way we did that was to get a perforated and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way we ran a control rig which but very encouraging and today i would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements so here we 've got engaging the black control rig which it had encountered about a minute and now that exact same shark had engaged and this was the final engagement and coming up and engaging in contrast to the sams technology rig this is the banded one where it 's more tactile it 's more investigative it 's more apprehensive and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go 's important for us that all the testing is done independently and the university of w a is doing the testing it 'll be an ongoing process it 's subject to peer review and subject to publication important that this concept is is led with the science from the perspective of shark attack mitigation systems we 're a biotechnology licensing company so we don 't make wetsuits ourselves we 'll license others to do that but i thought you might be interested in seeing what sams technology looks like the surfer from this side and we 've used science as a tool for translation translation of something that was already there into something that we can use for the benefit of and it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention after all did the wright brothers discover manned flight or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically replicate it in a way that humans could use i 'm guessing there 's a fair chance it won 't be pure black"
