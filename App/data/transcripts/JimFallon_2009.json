  "transcript": "i 've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters dopamine but then for some reason and so this would be the typical talk i would give and the question is how do you end up with a psychopathic killer what i mean by psychopathic killer are these people these types of people and so some of the brains that i 've studied are people you know about when i get the brains i don so we look at these sorts of things theoretically on the basis of genetics and interaction with environment and exactly how that machine works so we 're interested in exactly where in the brain and what 's the most important part of the brain so we 've been looking at this what 's called epigenetic effects and how these are tied together and how you end up with a psychopath and a killer depends on exactly when the damage occurs it 's really a very precisely and here 's just to give you the pattern the pattern is that those people every one of them i looked at who was a murderer and was a serial killer and also the interior part of the temporal lobe so there is the pattern that every one of them had but they all were a little different too they had other sorts of brain damage a key thing is that the major violence genes it 's called the because a daughter can get but for a son he can only get the x chromosome from his mother so this is how it 's passed from and it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development which but if you have this gene in utero your brain is bathed in this so your whole brain becomes insensitive to so it doesn 't work later on in life and it does have some consequences theoretically what this means is that in order to express this gene in a violent way very early on before puberty you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic not a little stress not being spanked or something but really and you see a lot of violence and what i think might happen in these areas of the world where we have constant violence you end up having generations of kids and if i was a young girl somewhere in a violent area fourteen year old and i want to so that was and you 're talking as if you come from a normal family i said what the hell are you talking about she then but the bad and the first murder of a mother by a son was my great great great great great great grandfather okay so that 's the first case of matricide and that book is very interesting because it 's about but it doesn 't stop there starting then cornells that were all murderers now this gives one a little pause but every once in a while like lizzie like three times a century the bad news is"
