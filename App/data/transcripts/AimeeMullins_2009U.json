  "transcript": "i was speaking to a group of about three hundred kids and i brought with me a bag full of legs similar to the kinds of things you see up here and had them laid out on a table kids are naturally curious about what they don 't know or don 't understand or is foreign to them and maybe censors that natural curiosity or you know reins in i just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby so i made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes the doors open the kids descend on this table of legs and they are poking and prodding and they 're wiggling toes and they 're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that said kids really quickly i decided i wanted to be able to jump over a house if you could think of any animal any superhero any cartoon character anything you can dream up right now what kind of legs would you build me and immediately a voice shouted why wouldn 't you want to fly too and the whole room including me was like yeah and just like that i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as somebody that had potential that their bodies didn 't have yet somebody that might even be super abled interesting so some of you actually saw me at ted eleven years ago and there 's been a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees and i am no exception was the launch pad to the next decade of my life 's exploration and also these very life like intrinsically painted silicone legs so at the time was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art function and aesthetic and assigning them different values well and the journey started funny enough with a ted conference attendee chee pearlman who and she gave me a cover story this started an incredible journey curious encounters were happening to me at the time i 'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world and and the conversation would go you 're very attractive you don 't look disabled i thought well that 's amazing because i don 't feel disabled and it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored about beauty what does a beautiful woman have a sexy body and nobody calls her disabled so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer peter saville went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen and photographer nick knight who were also interested in exploring that which resulted in this cover three months after that i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen nobody knew everyone thought they were wooden boots actually i have them poetry poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art it can transform the thing that might have made people fearful i learned this firsthand with my next adventure the artist matthew barney in his film opus called the the cremaster cycle i started to move away from the need to replicate so we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they 're actually optically clear polyurethane a k a bowling ball material heavy then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them and beetroots out the top and a very lovely brass little homage to my claws and a tail that whipped around like a gecko and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these look like jellyfish legs also polyurethane and the only purpose that these legs can serve outside the context of the film is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination so whimsy i have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me and with them i have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet and i can change my height i have a variable of five different heights today i 'm six ' one and i had these legs made a little over a year ago at dorset orthopedic in england and when i brought them home to manhattan my first night out on the town i went to a very fancy party and a girl was there who has known me for years at my and and she looked at me and she said but aimee that 's not fair really meant it it 's not fair that you can change your height as you want it the need to replicate"
