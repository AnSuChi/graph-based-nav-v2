  "transcript": "we 've got to make sure that we don 't seem like we 're a couple of middle aged boring the dots and how this journey that began so my first question where is google and where is it going lp well this is something we think about a lot and our mission we defined a long time ago is to organize the world 's information and people always say and i always kind of think about that myself and i 'm not quite sure but actually it 's such a deep thing for all of us to really understand what you want to understand the world 's information and we 're still very much in the early stages of that which is totally crazy but it 's not at all done cr when it 's done how will it be lp well i guess in thinking about where we 're going you know why is it not done a lot of it is just computing 's kind of a mess you know your computer doesn 't know where you are it doesn 't know know what you know and a lot we 've been trying to do recently is just make so really having computing work and understand you and understand that information we really haven 't done that yet it 's still very very clunky cr tell me when you look at what google is doing where does deep mind fit deep mind is a company we just acquired recently it 's in the which was and also make the computers not clunky and really understand you like voice was really important so what 's the state of the art on speech recognition very good it doesn 't really understand you so we started doing machine learning research to improve that and we started just looking at things like youtube can we understand youtube but we actually ran machine learning on youtube and it discovered cats just by itself now that 's an we realized there 's really something here if we can learn what cats are that must be really important so i think what 's really amazing about deep mind is that it can actually they 're learning things in this unsupervised way they started with video games just playing video games and learning how to do that automatically games and how machines are coming to be able to to do some remarkable things lp the amazing thing about this is this is i mean obviously these are old games but the system just sees what you see the pixels and it has the controls and it has the score same program it 's learned to play all of these games with superhuman performance not been able to do things like this with computers before and and it figures out it can sort of pin pin the opponent down the computer so imagine if this kind of intelligence were thrown at your schedule or information needs or things like that and that 's what what i 'm really excited about cr when you look at at all that 's taken place with deep mind and and the boxing also a part of where we 're going when you look at that lp well i think for me this is kind of one of the most exciting things i 've seen in a long time the guy who started this company he went back to school to get his ph d to and so i think we 're seeing a lot of exciting work going on that sort of crosses computer science and neuroscience in terms of really understanding what it takes to make something smart and do really interesting things cr but where 's the level of it now and how fast do you think we are moving lp well this is the state of the art right now we used a lot of machine learning to improve things incrementally but i think for me this example 's really exciting because it 's one program that can do a lot of different things cr i don 't know if we can do this but we 've got the image of cat it would be wonderful to see this this is how machines looked at cats and what they came up with can we see that image lp yeah cr designed by machines seen by machines lp that 's right so this is learned from just watching youtube and there 's no training no notion of a cat but this concept of a cat is something important can kind of understand maybe just finishing also on the search part it started with search really understanding people 's context and their information i did have a video i wanted to show quickly on that so i went and potato it said i have this friend who when i met him next he was going to put a windmill i felt proud because something that wasn 't there before was suddenly there i that not everybody can be able to access so i thought about a notice board so it 's basically like a computer when people have the knowledge they amazing thing about that video actually was we just read about it in the news and we found this gentlemen and made that little clip cr when i talk to people about you larry wants to change the world and he believes technology can show the way and this is an example released this loon project which is using balloons to do it it sounds totally crazy we can show the video here we actually think this can really help people get access to the internet why does this balloon give you access to the internet because there was some interesting things you had to do to figure out how to make balloons possible they didn 't have to be tethered lp yeah and this is a good example of innovation like we 've been thinking about this idea for five years or more before we started working on it but it was just really how do we get access points up high cheaply you normally have to use satellites and it takes a saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon and get it up and actually again it 's the power of the internet i did a search on it thirty forty years ago someone had put up a balloon and it had gone around the earth multiple times and and that 's how this project got going cr but are you at the mercy of the wind lp yeah but it turns out we did some weather simulations which probably hadn 't really been and if you control the altitude of the balloons which you can do by pumping air into them and other ways you can actually control roughly where they go and so i think we can build a worldwide mesh of these balloons let me talk a bit about what 's been the subject here earlier with edward snowden it is security and privacy you have to have been thinking about that lp yeah absolutely i saw the picture of sergey with edward snowden yesterday some of you may have seen it but i think for me i guess privacy and security are a really important thing we think about it in terms of both things and i think you can 't have privacy without security so let me just talk about security first because you asked about snowden and i think i don 't think we can have a democracy if we 're having to protect you and our users from the government and i don 't mean we have to know what the particular terrorist attack is they 're worried about protecting us from but we do need to know and i think we haven 't had that conversation so i think the government 's actually done itself a tremendous disservice by doing all that in secret cr i think we need to have a debate about that so i 'm sad that google 's in the position of protecting you and our users and then i think it 's the world is changing you carry a phone it knows where you are there 's so much more information about you and that 's an important thing and it makes sense why people are asking we spend a lot of time thinking about this and what the issues are i 'm a little bit i think the main thing that we need to do is just provide people choice show them what data 's being collected location data we 're excited about incognito mode in chrome and doing that in more ways people more choice and more awareness of what 's going on i also think and i look at on your show actually i kind of lost my voice and i haven 't gotten it back i 'm hoping that by talking to you i 'm going to get it back and i look at medical records and i say wouldn 't it be amazing if everyone 's medical records were available anonymously and when someone accesses your medical record a research doctor they could see you could see which doctor accessed it and why and you could maybe learn about what conditions you have i think if we just did that we 'd save one hundred thousand lives this year about the tremendous good that can come from people sharing information with the right people in the right ways cr sergey encouraged me to do that are super positive we got thousands and thousands of people with similar conditions which there 's no data on today so it was a really good thing cr so talking about the future what is it about you and transportation systems lp yeah i guess i was just frustrated with this when i was at college in michigan i had to get on the bus and take it and wait for it and it was cold and snowing i did some research on how much it cost and i just became a bit obsessed with transportation systems cr and that began the idea of an automated car lp yeah about eighteen years ago i learned about people working on automated cars and i became fascinated by that and it takes a while to get these projects going but i 'm super excited about the possibilities of that improving the world there 's twenty million people it 's the leading cause of death for people under thirty four in the u s cr so you 're talking about saving lives lp yeah and also los angeles is half half of the area and most cities are not far behind actually it 's just crazy that that 's what we use our space for cr and how soon will we be there lp i think we can be there very very soon we 've driven well over one hundred thousand miles now totally automated i 'm super excited about you also have this idea for bicycles lp well at google we got this idea that you see bikes going everywhere and the bikes wear out is actually how you might separate bikes from cars with minimal cost anyway it looks totally crazy but i was actually and i was thinking about how do you cost effectively separate the bikes from traffic and i went and searched and this is what i found and we 're not actually working on this that particular thing but it gets your imagination going cr let me close with this give me a sense of the philosophy of your own mind you have this idea of [ google you don 't simply want to go in some small measurable arena of progress lp yeah i think many of the things we just talked about are like that where they 're really i almost use the economic concept of additionality which means that you 're doing something and i think the more you can do things like that the bigger impact you have and that 's about doing things that the more you learn about you learn that the balloons are possible because there 's some material that will work for them cr what 's interesting about you too though for me is that we have lots of people who are thinking about the future and they are going and looking and they 're coming back but we never see the implementation the principle of that for you is what if you invent something tesla invented electric power that we use but he struggled to get it out to people and i think if we can actually combine both things where we have plus the ability to really a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people in a way that 's positive for the world and to give people hope you know i 'm amazed with the loon project just how excited people were about that because it gave them hope for the two thirds of the world that doesn 't have internet right now that 's any good cr which is a second thing about corporations you are one of those people who believe that corporations are an agent of change if they are run well and i think that 's somewhat correct companies are doing the same incremental thing that they did fifty years ago or twenty years ago that 's not really what we need we need especially in technology we need revolutionary change not if you were leaving it to some because you had confidence that he would change the future and that you would therefore lp yeah if you want to go mars he wants to go to mars to back up humanity and it 's so i think we aim to do kind of similar things and i think you ask we have a lot of employees at google people make a lot of money in technology a lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy you 're working because you want to change the world you want to make it better why isn 't the company that you work for i mean but we don 't have a concept of that and i think it 's sad because companies are most of our effort they 're where most of people 's time is where a lot of the money is and so i think i 'd like for us to help out more than we are cr when i close conversations with lots of people i always ask this question what quality of mind is it that has served you best people like rupert murdoch have said as i leave this audience has enabled you to think about the future and at the same time change the present lp we 've had a more rapid turnover of companies and i said what did they fundamentally do wrong what and usually it 's just that they missed the future and so i think what is that future really going to be and how do we create it and how do we cause our organization our organization to really focus on and so that 's been curiosity it 's been looking at things people might not think about working on things that no one else is working on because that 's where the additionality really is and be willing to do that to take that risk look at android i felt guilty working on android when it was starting it was a little startup we bought that was the future right that was a good thing to be working on cr it is great to see you here it 's great to hear from you and a pleasure to sit at this table with"
