  "transcript": "i 've been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of god who is god and i 'm very aware that when you say the word god many people will turn off immediately and most people both within and outside the organized church still have a picture of a celestial controller a rule maker a policeman in the sky who orders everything and causes everything to happen he will protect his own people and answer the prayers of the faithful and in the worship of my church the most frequently used adjective about god is almighty but i have a problem with that i have become more and more uncomfortable do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we 've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years of course there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at god suggesting that god expresses himself or herself acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them for fear of creating tension division in our church communities for fear of upsetting the simple faith 26th last year just two months ago that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami i found myself standing in front of my congregation mostly thoughtful christian people and i needed to express on their behalf our feelings i had my own personal but i also have a public role and something needed to be said and this is what i said shortly after the tsunami i read a newspaper article written by the archbishop of canterbury fine title about the tragedy in southern asia the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories about how god let this happen he wrote if some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense or more confident in god holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now there are no words that we could say to him the only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help or theology it 's a time for tears and yet we demand an explanation from god some have concluded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain in some way god must feel the anguish and grief and physical pain that we feel in some way the eternal god must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within and if this is true it must also be that god knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit as well we want a god who can weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice this seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re statement of christian belief about god the prevailing orthodoxy the accepted truth was that god the father the creator is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness now the unchanging god feels a bit cold and indifferent to me and the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question the cold unfeeling god the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask where is god in all this who is god in all this or god doesn 't deserve our allegiance anymore observing but not involved so we have a suffering god a god who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul i very much relate to this idea of god and i hope they are questions that you will want to ask as well some of you over the last few weeks i have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate a bit dodgy we have a pram service on tuesday mornings for mums and their pre school children and last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs the wise man built his house upon the rock perhaps some of you know it some of the words go like this the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the floods came up and the house on the sand went crash then in the same week at a funeral we sang in the second verse comes the line the wind and waves obey him i don 't feel we can sing that song again in church after what 's happened so the first big question is about control does god have a plan so that everything worked out all right some difficulty overcome some illness cured some trouble averted i can remember someone saying this to me with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith but if god can or will do these things intervene to change the flow of events then surely he could have stopped the tsunami do we have a local god but not big things like five hundred mile per hour waves that 's just not acceptable or god is not in control the man who surfed the wave the preacher delivered an extra long sermon that they were still out of harm 's way so the next question is about partiality can we earn god 's favor by worshipping him does god demand loyalty like any medieval tyrant a god while everyone else perishes a cosmic us and them and a god who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism that would be appalling and that would be the point at which i would hand in my membership such a god would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity so that heroism and compassion can be shown perhaps god is testing us our charity or our faith perhaps but these ideas are all just variations on god controlling everything the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign are still left with a god who can do the tsunami and allow auschwitz in his great novel the brothers karamazov dostoevsky gives these words to ivan addressed to his naive and devout younger brother alyosha if the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth then i say beforehand that the entire truth we cannot afford to pay so much for admission return him the ticket or perhaps but it still leaves god with the ultimate moral watching with infinite compassion things god is unable to control or change is god intimately involved in our suffering so that he feels it in his own being maybe god isn 't an agent like all of us are the people knew their god but what if god doesn 't act what if god doesn 't do things at all what if god is in things the loving soul of the universe in the natural cycle of life and death the creation and destruction the soul of the human race in you in in the depth of things in change and development and growth how does this in ness this innerness this interiority of god work i don 't know in the end we have to say i don 't know if we knew god would not be god to have faith in this god would be more like and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements isn 't it ironic that christians who claim to believe in an infinite unknowable being then tie god down in closed systems and rigid doctrines how could one practice such a faith by seeking the god within in silence in meditation in the me that remains when i gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations how would i live such a faith by seeking intimate connection with your inwardness the kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep if god is in all people then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a three way encounter there is an indian greeting which i 'm sure some of you know namaste accompanied by a respectful bow which roughly translated means that which is of god in me and how would one deepen such a faith in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary things of life there is a deep indwelling presence that it needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own when i stood up to speak to my people about god and the tsunami i had no answers to offer them no neat packages of faith with bible references to prove them only doubts and questioning the only thing i could say for sure was i don 't know just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all"
