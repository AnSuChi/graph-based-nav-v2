  "transcript": "but i know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth in hospitals there there 's a community of nurses and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years lassa virus lassa virus is a lot like ebola it can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal but these individuals they risk their lives every day and by doing so protect us all but one of the most extraordinary things i learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago start each morning these challenging extraordinary days on the front lines by singing and over the years from year after year as i 've visited them and they 've visited me we 're bonded through a and that changed when the ebola outbreak was declared in guinea this is the first outbreak in west africa near the border of sierra leone and and it was frightening frightening for us all we had actually suspected for some time that lassa and ebola were more widespread than thought and we thought it could one day come to kenema we 'd already set up this kind for lassa virus we knew how to do it the team is outstanding we just had to give them the tools and place to survey for ebola and unfortunately that day came on may twenty three two thousand and fourteen a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of ebola in sierra leone this was an exceptional work that was they were able to diagnose the case immediately to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on it could 've stopped something but by the time that day came we had to work with the international community with the ministry of health with kenema to begin to deal with the cases as the next week brought forty seven cases all coming to kenema one of the only places in sierra leone that could deal with this and we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could trying to help the individuals trying to get attention but we also did one other simple thing the other thing we and we quickly generated ninety nine genomes of the ebola virus this is the blueprint the genome of a virus is the compared to three genomes that had been previously published we could show that the outbreak emerged in guinea months before once into the human population and from there had been transmitting from human to human now that 's incredibly important when you 're trying to because the diagnostics the vaccines the therapies that we 're using are all based on that genome sequence fundamentally that 's what and so global health experts would need to respond would have to develop to recalibrate everything that they were doing doing submitted the paper for publication gone through a few back and forths well that was not going to work at this point right we had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help lots of help so the first thing we did is as soon as the we just released it to the whole world and said help us and help came before we knew it we were being contacted from people all over surprised to see the data out there and released some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community we were working together in this virtual way regular calls communications trying to follow the virus minute by minute to see ways that we could stop it everybody particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally was reaching out to learn to participate everybody wants to play a part the amount of human capacity out there is just amazing and the internet connects us all and could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other that we all just said let 's do this let 's work together and let 's make this happen but the problem is that the data that all of us are using googling on the web is just too limited to do what we need to do so in the early part of the epidemic from kenema and we once again made that publicly available to the world but one hundred and six is just not enough to make it to validate it so we were waiting for more data to release that and the data has still not come we are still waiting tweaking away in silos rather than working together cannot accept that it 's our lives on the line and in fact actually many health care workers including beloved these are just five of many health care workers at kenema and beyond quietly and separately see ebola like all threats to humanity it 's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division when we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves the virus thrives a graduate student of mine was reading a book about sierra leone and she discovered that the word translucent and open to the public gaze we had to share and we had to work and we have to do that we all have to demand that of ourselves to fight in this fight together because this is not the first outbreak of ebola and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait like lassa virus and others and i know dr khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always let us be in this fight with them but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity thank you"
