  "transcript": "we always hear that texting is a scourge the fact of the matter is but a miraculous thing a kind of emergent complexity that we 're seeing happening right now we have to pull the camera back for a bit and look at what language really is in which case one thing that we see is that texting is not writing at all what do i mean by that and what it arose as that 's what we 're probably genetically specified for that 's how we use language most writing is something that came along much later and as we saw in the last talk there 's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened but according to traditional estimates if so first there 's speech and then writing comes along as a kind of artifice now don 't get me wrong writing has certain advantages when you write because it 's a conscious process because you can look backwards you can do things with language that are much less likely if you 're just talking nobody talks that way or at least they shouldn 't if they 're interested in reproducing human being speaks casually casual speech is something quite different linguists have actually shown that when we 're speaking casually in an unmonitored way we tend to speak in it 's much more telegraphic but actually what language is is speech they are two things it 's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed between speech and writing so i mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving in an old movie where they clear their throat and they go it 's basically talking like you write and so for example we 're thinking so much these days about lincoln because of the movie the gettysburg address was not the main meal of that event for two hours before that cannot engage us today and barely did then the point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours it was perfectly natural that 's what people did then speaking like writing well if you can speak like writing then logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak the problem was just that in the material mechanical sense that was harder back in the day for the simple reason that materials don 't lend themselves to it it 's almost impossible to do that with your hand except in shorthand and then communication is limited on a manual typewriter it was very difficult and even when we had electric typewriters or then computer keyboards the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech more or less you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message then you have the conditions that allow that we can write like we speak 's where texting comes in and so texting is very loose in its structure no one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts despite the fact that it involves the but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline we see this general bagginess of the structure the lack of concern with rules and the way that we 're used to learning on the blackboard but the fact of the matter is that what is going on is a kind of emergent complexity that 's what we 're seeing in this fingered speech and in order to understand it what we want to see is the way in this new kind of language theoretically it does and if you look at older texts then people used it to actually indicate laughing but if you text now or if you are someone who is aware of the substrate of texting the way it 's become you 'll notice that lol does not mean laughing out loud anymore it 's evolved into something that is much subtler this is an actual text that was done by a non male person of about twenty years old not too long ago i love the font you gmail is being slow right now now if you think about it that 's not funny no one 's laughing so you assume there 's been some kind of hiccup then susan says lol i know again more guffawing than we 're used to when you 're talking about so julie says i just sent you an email susan lol i see it very funny people if that 's what lol means this julie says so what 's up susan lol i have to write a ten page paper she 's not amused let 's think about it lol is being used in a very particular way it 's a marker of empathy it 's a marker of accommodation we linguists call things like that pragmatic particles any spoken language that 's used by real people has them if you happen to speak that you use at the end of a lot of sentences if you listen to the way black youth today speak think about the use of the word yo whole dissertations could be written about it and probably are being written about it it 's a way of using the language between actual people it 's used to change the scene so for example this sally person says so i need to find people to chill with and jake says haha you could write a dissertation about haha too but we don 't have time for that haha so you 're going by yourself why program at nyu jake haha slash i 'm watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye the slash is interesting i don 't really even know what jake is talking about after that but you notice that he 's changing the topic now that seems kind of mundane but think about how in real life if we 're having a conversation and we want to change the topic there are ways of doing it gracefully you don 't just zip right into it pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance or you 'll say something like hmm makes you think when it really didn 't but what you 're really you can 't do that while you 're texting and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium all spoken languages have what a linguist calls a new information marker or two or three texting has developed one from this slash so we have a whole battery of new constructions that are developing well something is still wrong there 's a lack of structure of some sort it 's not as sophisticated as the language of the wall street journal well the fact of the matter is look at this person in one thousand nine hundred and fifty six and this is when texting doesn 't exist i love lucy is still on the air cannot write grammatically we 've heard that sort of thing before not just in seventeen connecticut schoolteacher one thousand nine hundred and seventeen this is the time when we all assume that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect because the people on downton abbey are articulate like that so you can go even further back than this it 's the president of harvard it 's there 's no electricity people have three names bad spelling incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in and he 's talking about people who are otherwise well prepared for college studies you can go even further back or you can go all the way there are always and so the way i 'm thinking of texting these days is that what we 're seeing is a whole new way of writing that young people are which they 're using alongside their ordinary writing skills and that means that they 're able to do two things increasing evidence is that being bilingual is and so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act that young people are using today not consciously of course but it 's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire simple if somebody from one thousand nine hundred and seventy three looked at what was on a dormitory message board in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three the slang would have changed a little bit since the era of love story but they would understand what was on that message board take that person from one thousand nine hundred and ninety three not that long ago this is bill and ted 's excellent those people take those people and they read a very typical text written by a 20 year old today often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole so in closing first thing i would ask is whether david simon had done a sequel to the wire i would want to know and i really would ask that and then the third thing would be please show me a sheaf of texts written by 16 year old girls thank you very much"
