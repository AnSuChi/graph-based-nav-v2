  "transcript": "i 'm gonna talk a little bit about let 's look back to the and kind of get a sense of this is verdun a battlefield in france just north of the nato headquarters in belgium at verdun in one thousand nine hundred and sixteen over a the second world war you see the battle of stalingrad three hundred days two million people killed we go from the trench warfare of the first world war the iron curtain my thesis for us today it 's in 's the bridge over the drina river the subject of a novel by again open source security is about connecting now i 'm a sailor it 's got concertina wire along the sides of it that 's to prevent pirates from attacking it piracy is also very active in the strait of malacca we see it in the caribbean it 's a discontinuity in the global this is an attack on the global commons we need to think about how to address it let 's shift to a different kind of here are photographs of two young men at the moment they 're incarcerated they conducted a credit card fraud this is part of cybercrime which is a so this cyber sea which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness is very much under threat as well another thing i worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking by the movement of narcotics above all perhaps we worry about human trafficking and the awful cost of it trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global commons this is a photograph and i wish i could tell you this is a run by drug cartels it was built in the jungles of south america we caught it with that low tech raft and let 's pull it together in this is a field of poppies in afghanistan terrorism this is where al qaeda is staged from we also see a very strong insurgency embedded and what we must address we know our tools are not going to work what should we do i would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun we will need the application of military force when we do it we must do it well and competently but my thesis is open source security is about international interagency private public connection pulled together by this idea of strategic communication this is afghanistan these are afghan soldiers they are all holding books i thought i read that this demographic young men and women in their because the taliban withheld education the answer is we are teaching them to read in literacy courses by nato in partnership with private sector entities in partnership with development agencies we 've taught well over two hundred thousand afghan security forces to read and write at a basic level at the ceremonies when these young men and women graduate they take that pen with great pride and put it in their this is bringing together international interagency these development agencies and private public to take on this kind of security now we are also teaching them combat skills of course but i would argue open source this is a us navy warship it operates throughout the caribbean and the coast of south america conducting patient treatments on a typical cruise they 'll do four hundred thousand patient it is crewed not strictly by military project smile other organizations send volunteers interagency physicians come out they 're all part of this to give you one example of the impact this can have this little boy when he was fitted over his extremely myopic eyes he suddenly looked up and said treatments this here you see baseball players can you pick out the two us army soldiers in this photograph they are the two young men on either side of these young boys this is part of a series of baseball clinics where we have explored collaboration between major league baseball the department of state who sets up the diplomatic piece of this and they put on clinics throughout latin america and the caribbean in honduras in nicaragua it shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that i would argue help create security for us another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief a us air force helicopter participating after the tsunami in two thousand and four which killed two hundred and fifty thousand people in each of these major disasters the kashmiri earthquake in pakistan more recently the awful combination which struck japan and its nuclear industry in all of these instances we see partnerships between international actors interagency you 're looking at this thinking ah i gave a talk like this in london a while back about this point i said as i say to all of you i 'm on facebook friend me the headline was nato admiral needs friends thank you which i do laughter and the story was a catalyst and the next morning i had hundreds of facebook friend requests from indonesians and finns need a friend and oh by the way what is nato so yeah we laugh but this is how we move the message and moving that message is how we connect international interagency private public this is a photograph i would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable competent militaries who can create real military effect that is the core of who we are and what we do and we do it to protect freedom freedom of speech all the things we treasure in our societies but you know life is not an on and off switch you don 't have to have a military that is either in hard combat i would argue life is a rheostat you have to dial it in there will be times when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis but there will be many instances as we 've talked about today where our militaries can be part of creating i would close by saying that we heard earlier today about wikipedia i use wikipedia all the time to look up facts and as all of you appreciate wikipedia is not created by twelve brilliant people locked in a room writing articles wikipedia every day is tens of thousands it 's a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together no one person no one alliance no one nation no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together the vision statement of wikipedia my thesis for you is that by combining international interagency private public strategic communication together"
