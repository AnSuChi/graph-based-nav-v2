  "transcript": "i was always loved and cared for first because i was the only son and the youngest of two in the family my sister and i would go searching for firewood starting at five in the morning and i remember seeing a small hunger is humiliation hunger is hopelessness for a hungry child politics and freedom my parents couldn 't give me any food to eat but even as a child i could feel the heaviness in their hearts over a million north koreans died of starvation in that time i saw my father wither away and die and then my sister told me that she was going to china to earn money but that she would return with money and food soon and i thought we would be together forever i didn 't even give her a hug when she left i didn 't know it was going to be a long goodbye i have not seen my mom or my sister since then suddenly i became an orphan and homeless not be the solution so i started to steal from food carts i found small jobs in exchange for food thirty three meters underground i was not or worse when i could not fall asleep i hoped that the next morning my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food that hope kept me alive grand hope i mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next trash can had bread even though it usually didn 't and then i would die hope kept me alive i told myself no matter how hard things got still i must live i realized but i would be risking my life or at least i could try for a better life by escaping to china i had learned that many people tried to cross the border to china in the nighttime to avoid being seen north korean border guards often shoot and kill people trying to cross the border without permission chinese soldiers where they face severe punishment first because i was still a kid second because i knew i was already taking a risk but it was harder than i was always worried about being caught and sent back some months later i met someone who was running an underground shelter for north koreans and was allowed to live there and eat regular meals for the first time in many years i was an f my father gave up on me but nevertheless my level of motivation still didn 't change before he died i decided to go just because they told me to without trying much but one day i came home but i realized there were not enough for everyone so i decided against it that my foster father had given me his i was so happy suddenly i remembered my biological father my foster father 's small act of love reminded me of my father who would love to share his food with me when he was hungry even if he was starving yet my father died of starvation and my answer was to promise to myself that i would study hard and get the best education in and for the first time ever in my life i received an academic award for excellence and made dean 's list from the first semester in high school is personal hope is something that no one can give to you in north korea i made it myself hope brought me to america i didn 't know what to do because i had this overwhelming freedom my foster father at that dinner gave me a direction i had hope but hope by itself is not enough many people helped me along the way to get here north koreans are fighting hard to survive but they cannot make it without help this is my message to you have hope but also help each other wherever you live my foster father didn 't intend to change my life in the same way you may also change someone 's life with smallest act of love but i confidently believe that your act of love and caring can also save another joseph 's life and change thousands of other josephs who are still having hope to survive personal and special story with us i know and in the off chance that she may be able to see this we wanted to give you an opportunity to send her a message joseph kim in korean ah you can do english then korean as well jk okay i 'm not going to make it any longer in korean because i don 't think i can make it without tearing up nuna it has been and i love you my life happily and study hard until i see i will also look for you and can i also make a small message to my mom ah sure please jk i haven 't spent much time with you i know that you still love me and you probably still i just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world"
