  "transcript": "but my brother deah and join me in standing up against hate he asks me to come over and comb his hair in preparation for his wedding photo shoot an american kid in dental school ready to take on the world and my emotions begin to overwhelm me i move to the back of the hall and burst into tears and the second even in that moment when everything was so distracting he was attuned to me he cups my face and says suzanne i am who i am because of you i love you about a month later i 'm back home in north carolina for a short visit and on the last evening i run upstairs to deah 's room eager to find out how he 's feeling being a newly married man i love her she 's an amazing girl and she is at just twenty one she 'd recently been accepted to join deah at unc dental school and at her urging they started their honeymoon off attending their favorite team i mean check out that form i 'll never forget that moment sitting there with him how free he was in his happiness my littler brother and alongside was involved in local and international community service projects dedicated to the homeless and refugees including a dental relief trip they were planning for syrian refugees in turkey used her creativity as an architectural engineering student to serve those around her making care packages for the local homeless among other projects that is who they were i take a deep breath and look at deah and tell him i have never been more proud of you than i am in this moment he pulls me into his tall frame hugs me goodnight and i leave the next morning without waking him to go back to san francisco ten days later i 'm on call at san francisco general confused i call my father who calmly intones there 's been a shooting in deah 's neighborhood in chapel hill it 's on lock down that 's all we know i hang up and quickly google shooting in chapel hill one hit comes up quote three people were i walk into my childhood home and faint into my parents ' arms sobbing only to find a void that will never be filled investigation and autopsy reports eventually revealed the sequence of events deah had just gotten off the bus from class razan was visiting for dinner already at home with yusor as they began to eat they heard a knock on the door when deah opened it their neighbor proceeded to fire multiple he then approached her from behind pressed the barrel of his gun against her head and with a single bullet lacerated her midbrain he then turned towards razan who was screaming for her life and execution style with a single bullet to the back of the head killed her on his way out he shot deah one last time a bullet in the mouth two in his chest and the rest in his extremities were executed in a place that was meant to be safe their home for months this man had been harassing them brandishing his gun on a couple of occasions his facebook was cluttered with anti religion posts yusor felt particularly threatened by him as she was moving in he told yusor and her mom that he didn 't like the way they looked in response yusor 's mom told her to be kind to her neighbor that as he got to know them he 'd see them for who they were saying he killed three kids over a parking the police issued a premature public statement that morning echoing his claims without bothering to question it or further investigate it turns out but the damage was already done i sit on my brother 's bed and remember his words the words he gave me so freely and with so much love i am who i am because of you that 's what it takes for me to climb through my crippling grief and speak out i cannot let my family 's deaths be diminished to a segment that is barely discussed on local news because they were visibly muslim and an arab muslim or muslim appearing person had killed three white american college students in their home what would we have called it a terrorist attack when white men commit acts of violence in the us and i do the only thing i know how i send a facebook message to everyone i know in media a couple of hours later in the midst of a chaotic house overflowing with friends and family our neighbor neal comes over sits down next to my parents and asks what can i do but as a neighbor who wants to help i ask him what he thinks we should do given the bombardment of local media interview requests he offers to set up a press conference at a even now i don 't have the words to thank him just tell me when and i 'll have all the news channels present he said he did for us what we could not do for ourselves in a moment of devastation and in under twenty four hours from the murders i 'm on cnn being interviewed by the following day major newspapers including the new york times chicago tribune published stories about deah yusor and razan these days it feels like islamophobia is a socially acceptable form of bigotry the palpable the random pat downs at airports that happen ninety nine percent of the time it doesn 't stop there here in the us we have presidential candidates like donald trump casually calling to register american muslims and ban muslim immigrants and refugees from entering this country it is no coincidence that hate crimes rise in parallel with election cycles just a couple months ago khalid jabara christian was murdered in oklahoma by his neighbor a man who called him a filthy arab this man was previously jailed for a mere eight months after attempting over khalid 's mother with his car the least we can do is talk about it because violence and hatred doesn 't just happen in a vacuum not long after coming back to the senior on rounds in the hospital when one of my patients looks over at my colleague gestures around her face and says san bernardino here i am having just lost three family members to islamophobia having been a vocal advocate within my program on how to deal with such humiliated days later rounding on the same patient she looks at me and says people are killing people in los angeles i sit on her bed and gently ask her have i ever done anything but treat you with respect and have i done anything but give you compassionate care she looks down and realizes what she said was wrong and in front of the entire team she apologizes and says i should know better i i receive this kind of treatment all the time odds are you may have experienced it whether for your race maybe we weren 't even aware of our own implicit biases but when we see it because it makes us uncomfortable but stepping right into that discomfort means you are also stepping into the ally zone there may be over three million muslims in america that 's still just one percent of the total population but the silence of our friends so what made my neighbor neal 's allyship so profound but he was also bringing in his professional expertise and resources when the moment called for it others have done the same larycia hawkins drew on her platform as the first tenured african american professor at wheaton college to wear a hijab in solidarity with muslim women who face discrimination every day he stepped up to support a 15 year old muslim girl 's mission to introduce a hijab including the community as a part of an us instead of an other the editor in chief of women 's running magazine just put the first hijabi to ever be on the cover of a us fitness these are all very different examples of people who drew upon their platforms and resources in academia tech and media to actively express their allyship what resources and expertise do you bring to the table are you willing to step into your discomfort and speak up when you witness hateful bigotry will you be neal and you in your respective communities all have a muslim neighbor colleague or friend your child plays with at school reach out to them let them know you stand with them in solidarity nothing will ever but when we raise our collective voices that is when we stop the hate"
