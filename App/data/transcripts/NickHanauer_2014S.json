  "transcript": "probably don 't know me but i am one of those 01 percenters that you hear about and read about and i am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat and tonight what i would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats to my people because it feels like it 's time for us all to have a chat i too am a proud and unapologetic capitalist i have founded cofounded or funded i was the first non family investor in amazon com i cofounded a company called aquantive that we sold to microsoft i tell you this i tell you this to show i have a broad and i have been rewarded obscenely for that with a life that etc etc etc i was a mediocre student i 'm not technical at all i can 't write a word my success is the consequence of spectacular luck of birth of circumstance and of timing i have an unusually high tolerance for risk and the other is i have a good sense a good intuition about what will happen in the future and i think that that intuition about the future essence i see pitchforks as in because while people like us plutocrats the top one percent of americans shared about eight percent of national [ income ] while the bottom fifty percent of americans shared eighteen percent thirty years later today the top one percent shares over twenty percent of national the bottom fifty percent of americans share twelve or thirteen while the bottom fifty percent of americans will share just six you see the problem isn 't that we have some inequality some inequality is necessary for a is at historic highs today and income continue to concentrate at the very tippy top our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a so i have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires it cannot last because if we do not do something to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society the pitchforks will come for us there are no examples the pitchforks will come for us if we do not address this it 's not a matter of if it 's when and it will be terrible when they come for everyone but particularly i know i must sound like some liberal do gooder i 'm not i 'm not making a moral argument that economic inequality is wrong what i am arguing is that rising economic inequality is stupid and ultimately but it 's also terrible for business too he didn 't just increase the productivity of his factories he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made ford intuited that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem and characterized by the same kinds of feedback loops you find in a natural ecosystem a feedback loop between customers and businesses raising wages which in turn increases wages and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity is precisely what is missing from today 's economic recovery trickle down policies that so dominate both political parties and embrace something i call middle out economics middle out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality that they 're not efficient at all but are effective if well managed this allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work by [ efficiently ] allocating existing resources it works creating new solutions to human problems the genius of capitalism is that it is an evolutionary it rewards people for solving other people 's problems the difference between a poor society and a rich society obviously is the degree to which that society has generated solutions in the form of products for its citizens the sum of the solutions that we have in our society really is our prosperity and this explains why companies like google and amazon and microsoft and apple and the entrepreneurs who created those companies have contributed so much to our nation 's prosperity 21st century perspective also makes clear that what we think of as economic growth is best understood as the rate at which we solve problems how many problem solvers diverse able problem solvers we have and thus how many of our fellow citizens but this maximizing participation thing doesn 't happen by accident it doesn 't happen by itself it requires effort and investment which is why all highly prosperous capitalist democracies are characterized by massive investments in the middle class and the infrastructure we plutocrats need to get this economics thing behind us this idea that the better we do the better everyone else will do it 's not true how could it be but i do not buy one thousand times as much stuff do i i what my partner mike calls my manager pants i could have bought two thousand pairs but what would i do with them laughter how many haircuts can i get how often can i go out to dinner no matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get we can never drive a great national economy only a thriving middle class can do that there 's nothing to be done my plutocrat friends might say bloomberg published an article i wrote called the capitalists case for a among my biggest admirers called it nick hanauer 's and yet just three hundred and fifty days after that article was published seattle 's mayor ed murray signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in seattle to fifteen dollars an hour more than double what the prevailing federal seven point two five rate is it happened because a group of us reminded the middle class that they are the source businesses have more we reminded them that when businesses pay workers a living wage we reminded them that low wage workers make terrible taxpayers and that when you raise the minimum wage for all businesses all businesses benefit yet all can compete your politician 's always echoing that trickle down idea by saying things like well if you raise the price of employment guess what happens you get less of it are you sure because there 's some contravening evidence since one thousand nine hundred and eighty the wages of ceos in our country have gone from about thirty times the median wage to five hundred times that 's raising the price of employment i have never seen a company outsource its ceo 's job automate export the job to china in fact we appear to be employing more ceos and senior managers than ever before so too for technology workers and financial services workers who earn multiples of the of the median wage and yet we employ more and more of them so clearly you can raise the price of employment and get more of it i know that most people think that we believe that the $ fifteen minimum wage in seattle we pay all workers $ nine which is almost thirty percent more than the federal minimum of seven point two five but crucially four hundred and twenty seven percent more than the federal tipped minimum of two point one and yet washington state is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation the restaurant business in seattle booming because the fundamental law of capitalism is when workers have more money businesses have more customers and need more workers when restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants that 's good for it despite what some restaurateurs may tell you is it more complicated than i 'm making but can we please stop insisting there is no evidence for it the most insidious thing about trickle down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer everyone is better off that will be bad for the economy this nonsense so can we please dispense with this rhetoric that says that rich guys like me and my plutocrat friends we plutocrats know even if we don 't like to admit it in public that if we had been born somewhere else not here in the united states we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit it even very very poor places it 's just that that 's all that those entrepreneurs ' customers can afford so here 's an idea for a new kind of economics a new kind of politics but also that the more people we include both as entrepreneurs and as customers the better it works let 's by all means shrink the size of government let 's invest enough in the middle class to make our economy fairer and by more truly competitive more able to generate the solutions to human problems that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity capitalism is the greatest social technology ever invented for the work of democracies is to maximize the inclusion of the many government balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers isn 't bad for capitalism it essential to it programs like a reasonable minimum wage affordable healthcare paid sick leave and the progressive taxation necessary to pay for the important infrastructure these are indispensable tools shrewd capitalists should embrace because no one benefits from it like us and i think that it is equally a tool that humans use to enforce and encode our social and moral preferences and prejudices about status and power which is why plutocrats like me have always needed to find persuasive stories to tell everyone else about why our relative relative positions are morally righteous and good for everyone and you are not like but investments in you will balloon our debt and bankrupt our great country that we matter that you don 't today we have the united states of america made us not the other way around that a thriving middle class is the source of prosperity in capitalist economies not a consequence of it and we should never forget that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit fellow plutocrats i think it may be time for us to recommit to our country a capitalism that will ensure that america 's economy remains the most dynamic and prosperous in the world let 's secure the future for ourselves our children and their children or alternatively we could do nothing hide in our gated communities and enjoy our planes and yachts and wait for the pitchforks"
