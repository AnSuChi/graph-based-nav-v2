  "transcript": "and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online but video has been left out it arrived on the web in a small box and there it has remained completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it in fact in over a decade on the web the only thing that has changed about video is the size of the box and the quality of the picture popcorn changes all of that it 's an online tool that allows anyone to combine and finally allowed to break free from the frame i want to give you a demo of a prototype that we 're working on that we 'll launch later this fall and so i 've made a short 20 second clip using a newscaster template and welcome to my newscast i 've added my location with a google map so try moving it around you can add pop ups with live links and custom icons or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content so let 's go back and i 'll show you what you saw there was a lot there so this is the timeline and if you 've ever edited video you 're familiar with this but instead of clips in the timeline what you 're looking at is web events pulled into the video now in this popcorn production we 've got the title card we 've got a google map that shows up picture in picture then popcorn lets it push outside the frame and take over the whole screen and a final article with a link out to the original article let 's go to this google map and i 'll show you how you can edit it all you do and puts it in the display and it 's live it 's not an image so you click on it you zoom in right down to street view if you want to which we can do right now so let 's add and so they 've set that as the default tag let 's try something else maybe something a bit more relevant to today today and just like the web 's completely remixable it also means there 's no proprietary software all you need is a web browser"
