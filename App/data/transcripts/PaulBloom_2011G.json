  "transcript": "this is hermann goering goering was hitler 's second in command in world war ii his designated successor and like hitler goering fancied himself a through world war ii stealing extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection and what he really wanted was something by vermeer so he finally found an art dealer a dutch art dealer named han van meegeren who sold him a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be ten million dollars was his favorite artwork ever tried at nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death then the allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him and at some point the dutch police came into amsterdam and arrested van meegeren which is itself i painted it myself i 'm a forger and he said i i also need alcohol and morphine because it 's the only way i can work so and then the charges of treason were dropped he had a lesser charge of forgery got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people there 's a lot more to be said he was a terrible man but you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery to his biographer he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world he had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually it wasn 't just him who was in for a shock once van and he boasted about all the great masterpieces that he himself had painted that were attributed to other artists in particular the supper at emmaus which was viewed as vermeer 's finest masterpiece his best work people would come [ from ] all over the world to see it it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum why does this matter i 'm a psychologists why do origins matter so much why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from well there 's an answer that many people would give many sociologists like veblen and wolfe among other things if you want to show off how rich you are how powerful you are but what i want to convince you of today is that there 's something else going on rather our response is conditioned on our beliefs about what they really are what they came from what they 're made of what their hidden nature is so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep and that this isn 't true just for higher level pleasures like so take food would you eat this well a good answer is it depends what is it few of you would eat it if it 's a rat or a human some of you would eat it only if it 's a strangely colored piece of tofu but what 's more interesting is how it tastes to you it tastes better to you they get to sip wine in front of them on a screen parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a christmas tree it 's not just that you say it 's more pleasurable you say you like it more you really experience it in a different way or take sex these are stimuli i 've used in some of my studies but how attractive you find them how rests critically on who you think you 're looking at you probably think the picture on the left is male the one on the right is female if that belief turns out to be mistaken it will make a difference if you like somebody they look better to you this is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do a particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as capgras syndrome so capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion sufferers of capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates but there 's at least one case where capgras syndrome had a happy ending research described a woman with capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover but that was before she got capgras syndrome after she got it she was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich virile handsome and aristocratic of course it was the same man but she was seeing him in different ways you can put shoes on your feet you can play golf with golf clubs and chewed up bubble gum doesn 't do anything at all for you but each of f kennedy and sold for three quarters of a million dollars at auction the bubble gum was chewed up by pop star britney spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars and in fact there 's a thriving market in the partially eaten the shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all according to an unconfirmed report a saudi millionaire offered ten million dollars for this pair of shoes they were the ones thrown at george bush at an iraqi press conference several years ago applause now this attraction to objects doesn 't just work for celebrity objects each one of us most have something in our life that 's literally irreplaceable in that it has value because of its history maybe your wedding ring maybe your child 's baby shoes so that if it was lost you couldn 't get it back you could get something that looked like it or felt like it but you couldn 't get the same object back with my colleagues george newman and gil diesendruck we 've looked to see what sort of factors what sort of history matters for the objects that people like so in one of our experiments we asked people to name a famous person who so one answer was george clooney then we asked them how much would you pay for george clooney 's sweater and then we asked other groups of subjects we gave them different restrictions and different conditions so for instance we told some people but you can 't tell anybody you own it and you can 't resell it but before it gets to you it 's thoroughly washed that causes a huge drop in the value as my wife put it you 've washed away the clooney cooties rather it 's because i want something that has a specific history in the case of artwork the history is special indeed the philosopher denis dutton in his wonderful book the art instinct but they have a different history the original is typically the product of a creative act the forgery isn 't i think this approach can explain differences in people 's taste in art okay who here it does nothing for them they just don 't like it which is that if you like the work of you 'll tend more so than the people who don 't like it to believe that these works are difficult to create and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars in large part because she 's a very young artist this is marla olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old and they then reported that her father was coaching her when this came out on television the value of her art dropped to nothing but the history had changed i 've been focusing now on the visual arts but i want to give two examples from music this is joshua bell a very famous violinist and the washington post reporter gene weingarten decided to enlist him subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make and here 's a brief clip of this after being there for three quarters of an hour he made thirty two dollars you have to know you 're listening he actually made twenty dollars more than that but he didn 't count it because this woman comes up you see at the end of the video she comes up she had heard him at the library of congress a few weeks before at this black tie affair so she 's stunned that he 's standing in a subway station so she 's struck with pity she reaches into her purse and hands him a twenty the second example from music is from john cage 's modernist composition as many of you know this is the composition where and people have different views on this but what i want to point out is you can buy this from itunes listen to that silence which is different than other forms of silence now but what i want to suggest is that everything i 've said applies as well to pain affect how it hurts one lovely experiment was half of them are told that they 're being given the shocks by somebody in another room the second shock feels less painful because you get a bit used to it the third drops the fourth the fifth the pain gets less it hurts more if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose the most extreme example of this is that in some cases pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure humans have this extraordinarily interesting property that will often seek out low level doses of pain in controlled circumstances and take pleasure from it as in the eating of hot chili peppers the point was nicely summarized by the poet john milton who wrote the mind is its own place in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven and i 'll end with that thank you"
