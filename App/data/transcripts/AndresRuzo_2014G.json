  "transcript": "as a boy in lima my grandfather told me a legend of the spanish conquest of peru pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich and tales of their conquest and glory had reached spain and bringing new waves of spaniards hungry for gold and glory they would go into towns and ask the inca out of vengeance told them go to the amazon you 'll find all the gold you want there in fact there is a city dorado in spanish made entirely of gold the spanish set off into the jungle but the few that return come back with stories stories of powerful shamans of warriors with poisoned arrows snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled all this became a childhood memory and years passed i 'm working on my phd at smu and i began asking that question could the boiling river exist and this makes sense you see boiling rivers do exist in the world but they 're generally associated with volcanoes you need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal we should not expect to see a boiling river telling this same story at a family dinner my aunt tells me but no been there i 've swum in that river and it 's protected by a powerful shaman your aunt she 's friends with his wife and mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary warm stream of the amazon i heard something a low surge that got louder and louder i saw this i immediately grabbed for my thermometer the average temperatures in the river were this is not quite the 100 degree c boiling but definitely i followed it upriver and was led by actually the shaman 's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river and this is what 's bizarre it starts off as a cold stream and here at this site is the home of the and here we find mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws the next morning i woke up and i asked for tea the water was clean and had a pleasant taste which is a little weird for geothermal systems what and that i was by no means the first outsider to see they cook with it clean with it even make their medicines with it i met the shaman and he seemed like an extension he asked for my intentions then to my tremendous relief i was freaking out to be honest with you and he just laughed on the condition that after i take the water samples and analyze them in my lab wherever i was in the world that i pour the waters back into the ground i 've been back every year since that first visit in two thousand and eleven and the fieldwork has been exhilarating demanding and times one story was even featured in national geographic magazine i was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper looked like this close to boiling and on top of now after years of work i 'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical and i 'd like to share today with all of you here on the ted stage for the first time some of these discoveries surprise when i first started the research i now have this with the heat of the sun and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us so why does the fault fed hot springs as we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries so too the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults where these arteries come to the surface these earth arteries we 'll get geothermal manifestations next time you cross the road think about this it flows hot for six point there are thermal pools larger than this ted stage and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall and all with and the results were just awesome geoscientist in me coming out and it showed this amazing trend you see the river starts off cold it now i understand not all of you are geothermal scientists so to put it in more everyday put in coffee shop terms the boiling river plots like this there you have your hot coffee here you have your extra hot coffee and you can see that there 's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even but there 's a magic number here that 's not being shown and that number is and i know this from very personal experience above that temperature you don 't want to get in that water you need to be careful i 've seen all sorts of animals fall in and what 's shocking to me is the process is eyes apparently cook very quickly they turn this milky white color the stream is carrying them they 're trying to swim out but their meat is cooking on the bone because it 's so hot so they 're losing power losing power until finally finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out a bit sadistic aren 't we jeez leave them marinating for a little longer they 're similar to things that i 've seen on volcanoes all over the but here 's the thing the data how can a boiling river and i 'm still unable to find another it 's it 's special on a global scale so still how does it work where do we get this heat there 's still more research to be done it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system the waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the andes then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient we found that in and around the river this is working with colleagues from despite all of these studies all of these discoveries and the legends a question remains what is the significance of the boiling river what is the significance of this stationary cloud and what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend to the shaman and his community it 's just another resource to exploit it 's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development my goal is and the thing there is we are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial and in this age where everything seems mapped measured and studied i remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise noise of overwhelming data so go out because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits thank you very much"
