  "transcript": "my name is frank and i collect secrets it all started with a crazy idea in november of two thousand and four i printed up three thousand self addressed postcards just like this they were blank on one side and on the other side i listed some simple instructions i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they 'd never told anyone before but soon the idea began spreading virally people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards i started receiving secrets in my home soon my crazy idea didn 't seem so crazy is the most visited and this is my postcard collection today you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half million secrets what i 'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection starting with this one i found these stamps as and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to i never did have someone they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet this one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard this one obviously was made out of half a starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side i 've found love i 'm happy playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now everyone who knew me before i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people so sometimes i didn 't wear panties and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you i and i should also mention that just like today at that postsecret event i was using a wireless we all heard you pee until i realized it could have been worse i feel like the happiest person on earth he pays me a lot to keep it a secret that saturday when you wondered where i was well i was getting your ring it 's in my pocket right now i had this postcard posted on the postsecret blog two years ago on valentine 's day it was the very bottom the last secret in the long column and it hadn 't been up for more than a couple hours before i received this exuberant from the guy who mailed me this postcard and he said frank i 've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life he said my knees are still shaking i read some to and so when i discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom i was beside myself and i tried to act calm not to give anything away and just like every sunday we started reading the secrets out loud to each other but she finally did she got to that bottom secret his proposal to her and he said she read it once and then she read it again and she turned to him and said is that our cat laughter and when she saw him he was down on one knee he had the ring out he popped the question she said yes it was a very happy ending so i emailed him back and i said please share with me an image something that i can share with the whole postsecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending and he emailed me this picture i found your camera at lollapalooza i finally got the pictures developed and i 'd love to give them to you this picture never got returned back to the people who lost it but this secret has impacted many lives starting with a student up in canada named matty matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website a website called cameras that they 've found memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos and matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they 've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for this one 's my favorite matty has found this ingenious way and it might seem like a simple idea and it is but the impact it can have on people 's lives can be huge matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture that 's me my husband and son thank you for making your site these pictures mean more to me than you know my son 's birth is on this camera he turns four tomorrow every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it sometimes crossing oceans sometimes going through language barriers this is the last postcard i have to share with you today when people i love leave voicemails on my phone i always save them in case they die tomorrow and i have no other way of hearing their voice ever again dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones sometimes ones they 'd been keeping for years messages from family or friends who had died they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive one young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother they can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet again have you ever sent yourself a postcard i think in some ways the reason i started the project even though i didn 't know it at the time was because i was struggling with my own secrets and it was through crowd sourcing it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me that i could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me and has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book has anyone in your life been able to tell fw sometimes i share that information"
