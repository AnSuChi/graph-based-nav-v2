  "transcript": "i would like to share with you today a project that has changed how i approach and practice architecture the fez river rehabilitation project nestled in a river valley since the one of the biggest casualties of the situation was the fez river which bisects the medina in its middle and has been considered for many centuries as the city 's very soul it has been this process of erasure was coupled with the destruction of many houses along the river banks to be able to make machineries enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina those urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards actually the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy then pollution takes and i decided to take action especially after i heard that the city received a grant to divert sewage water and to treat it however we were sneaky and we proposed more to convert riverbanks and finally to convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the medina of fez i will show you briefly now two of these public spaces which you can see here in dotted lines this plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub that that has the largest pedestrian network in the world and right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here right next to the plaza you can see that the river looked like a river of trash instead what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian the second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks and it used to be an illegal parking and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina the playground is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland that not only cleans the water of the river but also retains it when floods new stakeholders intervened and changed the project goals and design the only way for us to be able to bring the main goals of the project ahead was for us to do something very unusual that usually architects don 't do it was for us to take our design ego and our sense of authorship and put it in the backseat and to focus mainly on being activists and on trying to coalesce treat its water and provide public spaces for all we were actually very lucky and many of those goals happened or are in the process of happening like you can see here in the rcif plaza how it looked like about six years ago then after many years of work the river so for sure the fez river rehabilitation will keep on changing and adapting to the sociopolitical landscape of the city but we strongly believe that by reimagining the role and the agency of the architect we have set up the core idea of the project into motion that is to transform the river from sewage to public space for all thank you very much"
