  "transcript": "grandson sleeps just down the hall from me and he wakes up a lot of mornings and he says you know this could be the best day ever and other times in the middle of the night he calls calls out in a tremulous voice nana will you ever get sick and die so little truth in the popular culture and it 's good to be sure of a few things for instance i am no longer although this is the age i feel and the age i like to think of myself as being my friend paul used to say in his late 70s that he felt like a young man with something really wrong with him our true person is outside of time and space looking at the paperwork i can in fact see that i was born in although i can 't help mentioning as an aside that it might have been helpful if i hadn 't followed the skin care which involved getting as much sun as possible while slathered in baby oil and basking in the glow of a tinfoil reflector shield it was so liberating though to face the truth that i was no longer in the last throes of middle age that i decided to write down every single true thing i know people feel really doomed and overwhelmed these days and they keep asking me what 's true so i hope that my list of things i 'm almost positive about number one the first and truest thing is that all truth is a paradox life is both a precious unfathomably beautiful gift and it 's impossible it 's so hard and weird that we sometimes wonder if we 're being punked desperate floods and babies and acne and mozart all swirled together i don 't think it 's an ideal system laughter number two almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes unless you 're waiting for an organ you can 't buy achieve or date serenity and peace of mind this is the most horrible truth and i so resent it and we can 't arrange peace you can 't run alongside your grown children with sunscreen and chapstick on their hero 's journey you have to release stop helping so much don 't get your help and goodness all over everybody so try not to compare your insides to other people 's outsides it will only make you worse than you already are also you can 't save fix or rescue any of them or get anyone sober what helped me get clean and sober thirty years ago was the so i asked some sober friends for help and i turned to a higher power one acronym for god is the gift of desperation or as a sober friend put it by the end i was deteriorating faster than i could lower my standards so god might mean in this case me running out of any more good ideas radical and it radiates out from you into the atmosphere like a little fresh air it 's a huge gift to the world when people respond by saying well isn 't she full of herself just smile obliquely like mona lisa and make both of you a nice cup of tea being full of affection for one 's goofy it 's where world peace begins percent cacao is not actually a food laughter its best use is as a bait in snake traps it was never meant to be considered an edible they do it by with themselves they do it as a they tell stories that come through them one day at a time little by little when my older brother was in fourth grade he had a term paper on birds due the next day and he he hadn 't started pencils and brads for those of you who have gotten a little he said to my brother just take it bird by bird buddy and then and then geese so the two most important things about writing are bird by bird and really you don 't know where to start remember that every single thing that happened to you is yours and you get to tell it they should 've behaved better you 're going to feel like hell if you wake up someday and you never wrote the stuff that is tugging on the that 's really all you have to offer us seven publication and temporary creative successes are something you have to recover from they kill as many people as not they will hurt damage and change you in ways you cannot imagine the most degraded and evil people i 've ever known are male writers who 've had huge best sellers and yet returning to number one that all truth is paradox it 's also a miracle to get your work published to get your stories read and heard just try to bust yourself gently of the fantasy that publication will heal you that it will fill the holes inside of you it can 't it won 't but writing can so can singing in a choir or a bluegrass band so can painting community murals or birding or fostering old dogs that no one else will families are hard hard hard no matter how cherished and astonishing they may also be again see number one at family gatherings where you suddenly feel homicidal or suicidal it 's a miracle that any of us specifically were conceived and born earth is forgiveness school it begins with forgiving yourself and then you might as well start at the dinner table that way you can do this work in comfortable pants when william blake said that we are here to learn to endure the beams of love he knew that your family would be an you can do it cinderella you can do it nine food try to do a little or water wings the mystery of grace is that god loves henry kissinger and vladimir putin and me go figure the movement of grace is what changes us heals us and heals our world to summon grace say help and then buckle up grace finds you exactly where you are but it doesn 't leave you where it found you and grace won 't look like casper the friendly but the phone will ring or the mail will come and then against all odds you 'll get your sense of humor about yourself back laughter really is carbonated holiness it helps us breathe again and again and gives us back to ourselves and this gives us faith in life and each other and remember grace eleven it means the divine or a loving animating intelligence or as we learned from the great so go outside a lot and look up secret of life and finally death and no matter what the culture says you 're not supposed to we christians like to think of death as a major but in any case the person will live again fully in your heart if you don 't seal it off like leonard cohen said there are cracks in everything and that 's how the light gets in and that 's how we feel our people again fully alive also the people will make you laugh out loud at the most inconvenient but their absence will also be a lifelong nightmare of homesickness for you grief and friends time and tears will heal you to some extent tears will bathe and baptize and hydrate and moisturize you and the ground on which you walk do you know the first thing that god says to moses he says take off your shoes because this is holy ground all evidence to the contrary when you 're a little bit older like my tiny personal self and don 't worry get on with your life almost every single death is easy and gentle with the very best people surrounding you for as long as you need you won 't be alone they 'll help you cross over to whatever awaits us as ram dass said when all is said and done we 're really just all walking each other home i was very surprised to be asked to come because it is not my realm technology or design or entertainment i mean my realm is sort of faith and writing and and i was surprised but they said i i could give a talk yours and you get to tell"
