  "transcript": "called the danish twin study established that only about ten percent the other ninety percent is dictated by our lifestyle so the premise of blue zones if we can they 've probably heard of the south beach diet or the atkins diet you have the usda food should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu when it comes to supplements should you be taking them how about these hormones or resveratrol and does purpose play into it spirituality and how about how we socialize well our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic and the national institute on aging to find the four demographically confirmed areas and then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do to distill down the cross cultural distillation and the first myth the problem is only about one out of five thousand people in america the problem is that we 're not programmed for longevity we are programmed for something called procreative success i love that word it reminds me of my college days biologists term procreative success to to mean the age where you have children and then another generation the age when your children have children after that the effect of evolution completely dissipates if you 're a rat or an elephant or a human in between it 's the same story so to make it to age one hundred you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle you also have to have won the genetic lottery the second myth is there are treatments that can help slow deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes those brain cells die they never come back the cartilage never comes back our arteries can clog our brains can gunk up with plaque and we can get alzheimer 's there is just too many things to go 're talking national debt numbers here and that damage builds up and it builds up exponentially it 's a little bit like the days when we all had beatles albums or eagles albums and we 'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape and let our friends copy that cassette tape and pretty soon with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage well the same things happen to our cells that 's why a 65 year old person is aging at a rate of about one hundred and twenty five times faster than a 12 year old person well the fact of the matter is the best science is about ninety years a little bit more for but life expectancy in this country is only seventy eight so somewhere along the line we 're leaving about twelve good years on the table these cancer and diabetes we think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them areas where people are living to age one hundred at rates up to ten times greater than we are areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction and not the entire island the island is about one point four million people but only up in the highlands an area called the nuoro province and here we have this area where men live the longest about ten times more centenarians and this is a place where people not only reach age one hundred they do so with extraordinary vigor chop wood and can beat a guy sixty years younger than them their history actually goes back to about the time of christ it 's actually a bronze age culture that 's been isolated because the land is so infertile they largely are shepherds physical activity their diet is mostly plant based accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat a type of cheese made from grass fed animals so the cheese is high in omega 3 fatty acids instead of omega 6 fatty acids from corn fed animals but the real secret i think lies more in the way that they organize their society and one of the most salient elements of the sardinian society is how they treat older people you ever notice here in america social equity seems to peak at about age twenty four just look at the here in sardinia the older you get the more equity you have the more wisdom you 're celebrated for this as it turns out is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy research shows it 's also good for the children of those families who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease disease that 's called the grandmother effect we found our second blue zone on the other side of the planet okinawa is actually one hundred and sixty one small islands and in the northern part of the main island this is ground zero for world longevity this is a place where the oldest living they live about seven good years longer than the average american five times as many centenarians as we have in america one fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease and the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us what do they do and they eat about eight times as much tofu as americans do more significant than what eat is how they eat it which as you know is a big problem here in america instead of serving family style where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you 're talking they serve at the counter put the food away and then bring it to the table it 's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [ eighty ] percent full it takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain and by remembering to stop at eighty percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing but like sardinia okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity we know that isolation kills fifteen years ago the average american had three good friends we 're down to one and half right now if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through and if you 're in a moai you 're expected to share the bounty if you child gets sick parent dies you always have somebody who has your back these five ladies have been together for ninety seven years their average age is one hundred and two typically in america we 've divided our adult life up into two and typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair or going down to arizona to to play golf in the okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement instead there is one word that for this karate master his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art for this hundred year old fisherman it was continuing and this is a question the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians and one of the questions they were very culturally astute the people who put the questionnaire one of the questions was what is your ikigai they instantly knew why they woke up in the morning for this one hundred and two year old woman her ikigai was simply her and i asked her what it felt like to hold a and she put her head back and she said it feels like leaping into heaven i thought that was a wonderful thought my editor at geographic wanted me to find america 's blue zone and for a while we looked on the prairies of minnesota where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians but that 's because all the young people left they celebrate their sabbath from sunset on friday till sunset on saturday sanctuary in time they call it and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity comparatively speaking but for an adventist woman their life expectancy is eighty nine and the difference is even more pronounced among men who are expected to live about eleven years longer and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project the only thing that they have in genesis chapter one they take this sanctuary in time very serious for twenty four hours every week no matter how busy they are how stressed out they are at work where the kids need to adventists also tend to hang out with other adventists so if you go to an adventist 's party you don 't see people swilling jim beam instead they 're talking about but they influence each other in profound and measurable ways this is a culture that has yielded ellsworth whareham ellsworth whareham is ninety seven years old he 's a multimillionaire yet when a contractor wanted six thousand dollars to build a privacy fence he said for that kind of money i 'll do it myself but not as the guy on the table the guy marge is one hundred and four her grandson actually lives in the twin cities here she starts her day with cadillac seville and tears down the san bernardino freeway where she still volunteers for seven different organizations i 've been on nineteen hardcore expeditions i 'm probably the only person you 'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the sahara desert without sunscreen but i 'll tell you there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with marge deton a stranger is a friend i haven 't met yet she 'd say to me and we managed to boil it down to nine in fact we 've done two more blue zone expeditions since this and the first one and i 'm about to utter a heresy here none of them exercise thirty or forty times a day sardinians live in vertical houses up and down the stairs every trip to the store or to church or to a friend 's house occasions if they want to mix up a cake they 're doing it by hand they tend to and they all tend to have a garden they know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook each of these cultures take time to downshift but when you 're in a hurry or stressed out that triggers something called the inflammatory response which is associated with everything from alzheimer 's alzheimer 's disease to cardiovascular disease when you slow down for fifteen minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more they have vocabulary for sense of purpose ikigai like the okinawans you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you 're born because of infant mortality and the year you retire and they activate in their life that 's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy there 's no longevity diet instead these people drink a little bit every day not a hard sell to the american population and they have strategies to keep from overeating little things that nudge them away from the table at the right and then the foundation of all this is how they connect they put their families first take care of their children and their aging parents and the biggest thing here they were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people we know from the framingham studies that if your three best friends are obese there is a fifty percent better chance that you 'll be overweight so if you hang out with unhealthy people that 's going to have a measurable impact over time instead if your friend 's idea of bowling or playing hockey biking if your friends drink a little but not too much and they eat right and they 're engaged and they 're trusting and trustworthy that is going to have the biggest impact over time"
