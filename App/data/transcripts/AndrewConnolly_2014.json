  "transcript": "recognition that something was different that something wasn 't quite right was the discovery of a planet the planet uranus but a planet that overnight doubled the size of our known solar system just last month nasa announced the discovery of five hundred and seventeen new planets in orbit around nearby stars almost doubling so astronomy is constantly being transformed by this capacity to collect data within the next two decades me may even reach the point for the first time in history where we 've discovered the majority of the galaxies within the universe but as we enter this era of big data what we 're beginning to find is there 's a difference between more data being just better whether they change the way we view the sky what is the next chapter for astronomy well i and how these technologies together with the smart use of data may once again transform astronomy the origins of our solar system how our solar system came into being is it unusual why our universe is continuing to expand and what is this mysterious dark energy that drives that expansion but first i want to show you how technology is going to change the way we view the sky so imagine if you were sitting in the mountains of northern chile looking out to the west towards the pacific ocean a few hours before sunrise this is the view of the night sky that you would see and it 's a beautiful view with the milky way just but the universe is anything but static it constantly changes on timescales of seconds to billions of years galaxies merge they collide at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour and we allow time to move forward the pulsations that you see are supernovae the final remnants of a dying star each one of these supernovae five billion times the so we can see them to great distances but only for a short amount of time now if we fade out the not just brightness that changes our sky is in constant motion this swarm of and it 's these changes and the motion and it 's the dynamics of the system that allow us to build our models for our universe to predict its future but the telescopes we 've used over the last decade are not designed to capture the data at this scale the hubble space telescope twenty five years it 's been producing some of the most detailed views of our distant universe it would take thirteen million individual images about one hundred and twenty years to do this just once so this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes telescopes that can go faint to look at the distant universe but also telescopes that can go wide or the lsst possibly the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy in fact proof if you should need it that you should never allow a scientist or an engineer to name anything not even your children well how do you capture well you build the largest digital camera in history using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you can buy in the high street but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across so if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution just a single taking a new picture every twenty seconds constantly scanning the sky so every three nights we 'll get a completely new view of the skies above chile over the mission it will detect forty billion stars and galaxies and that will be for the first time we 'll have detected more objects in our universe than now we can talk about this in terms of terabytes and petabytes and billions of objects but a way to get a sense of the amount of data that will come off this camera is that it 's like playing every ted talk ever recorded seven days a week for ten years and to process this data means searching through all of those talks for every new idea and every new concept looking at each part of the video to see how one frame may have changed from the next and this is changing the way that we do science changing the way that we do astronomy to a place where software and algorithms have to mine through this data where the software is as critical to the science as the telescopes and the cameras that we 've built but the and one of the questions we face is is it just that we haven 't been looking hard enough or is there something special or unusual about how our solar system formed and it 's the details that are crucial if we look back at the sky so studying the asteroids is like performing forensics well if you look at the little yellow asteroids flitting across the screen these are the asteroids that are moving because they 're closest to us closest to earth but they 're also the asteroids that may one day impact the earth like happened sixty million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs or just at the beginning of the last century when an asteroid wiped out almost one thousand square miles of siberian forest releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb including our future now when we get distance so every point in this visualization that you can see is a real asteroid its orbit the colors reflect the composition of these asteroids dry and stony in the center water rich and primitive towards the edge water rich asteroids which may have seeded the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet when they bombarded the earth at an earlier time increasing the detail by factors of ten to one hundred we will be able to answer questions such as is there evidence and to find out whether maybe our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars and maybe it 's this sun 's stellar siblings that influenced the formation of our solar system and maybe that 's one of the reasons why solar systems like ours seem to be so rare now distance and changes in our universe distance and this idea or this notion of looking back in time has revolutionized our ideas about the universe but multiple times the first time was in one thousand nine leading to the ideas of the big bang and the observations were simple just twenty four galaxies but just the idea that the more distant a the faster it was receding was enough to give rise to modern cosmology a second revolution happened seventy years later when two groups of astronomers showed that the universe wasn 't just expanding it was accelerating and they showed this by measuring the of supernovae and how the brightness of the supernovae got fainter with distance and these observations were more complex they required new technologies and new telescopes because the supernovae were in galaxies that were two thousand times more distant than the ones used by hubble and it took three years to find just because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy three years to find forty two supernovae by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies and once they 'd collected their data this is what they found but this is what a revolution in physics looks like small changes allow us to make discoveries like the planet found by herschel small changes turn our understanding of the universe on its revealing a component of our universe which we now call dark energy a component that drives this expansion so what is the next revolution likely to be well what is dark energy and why does it exist each of these lines shows a different model for what dark energy might be showing the properties of dark energy but the ideas behind these lines are dramatically different some people sub atomic level or they look at large scales but well imagine if i gave you a pair of dice but the more times you rolled them the more data you collected the more confident you would and in what way it took three years to find just forty two supernovae because the telescopes that we built lsst we get a completely new view of the skies above chile every three nights it will find ten times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy this will increase by one thousand within the first four months one point five million supernovae each supernova a roll of the dice each supernova testing which theories of dark energy are consistent and which ones are not and so by combining these supernova data with other measures of cosmology we 'll progressively rule out the different ideas and theories of dark energy until hopefully at the end of this survey around two thousand and thirty to gradually emerge now in many ways the questions that i posed are in reality the simplest of questions but if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies revealed when we 're working with billions of galaxies how many more times are we going to find forty two points that don 't quite match what we expect like the planet found by herschel or dark energy or quantum mechanics or general relativity all ideas that came because the data didn 't quite match what we expected what 's so exciting about the next decade of data in astronomy"
