  "transcript": "i 'm in southern ethiopia i daasanach there 's a big family there 's a very beautiful and i make these pictures with this very large extremely cumbersome very awkward technical plate film camera does anybody know sheets of film and they sort of understand what i 'm on about they think i 'm a bit crazy but that 's another story and so the light 's setting on my and there 's a balance in the communication with the daasanach the family of thirty all ages there 's babies and there 's grandparents i and it 's going going and i 've got one sheet of film left and i think i 'm okay i 'm in control i 'm in control i 'm setting it up and i 'm setting up and the light 's just about to go and i want it to be golden i and all of a sudden there 's a massive whack and and i 'm and the whole tree collapses not the tree but the people in the tree they 're all running around screaming and they run back off into the village in this sort of cloud of smoke and i 'm left there standing behind my tripod it took me a week it took and they 'd started having a fight and put them on a pedestal i had to understand them it wasn 't just right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who and i 've got the tree and everything and then at the last minute i go the goat the goat i need something for the eye to look at i need a white goat in the middle so i swapped all the goats around i put but even then i got it wrong because if you can see on the left hand side another little boy storms off because i didn 't choose his goat so the moral being i have to learn to speak goat as well as daasanach but anyway the effort that goes into that picture i 'm a real romantic 'm an idealist but i truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful it 's very very simple it 's not rocket science so i chose about thirty five different groups tribes indigenous cultures about a year ago i published the first pictures and something extraordinarily exciting happened the whole world came running you faked it i really didn 't have the answers and i could sort of understand okay they 're beautiful that was my intention but who 's ted do i have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage and no no the ted group you must know about it and i said i 've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last we have to do a ted talk but what you need to do you need to teach the people lessons lessons that you 've learned on your travels around the world with these tribes i thought lessons okay well what did i learn good question three you need three lessons and they need to be terribly so i thought long and hard and i stood here two days ago and and i had this very odd out of body experience i sort of had more of these talks they 've heard more lessons in their life who are you to tell them what you 've learned who are you to guide them and who are you to show them what is right what is wrong what these people have to say and i had a little bit of a it was very private a little bit of a meltdown i went back and a little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats very there 's only one person i know here and that 's me and it 's a lifelong journey and i probably won 't have all the answers but i did learn some extraordinary things it 's a very and i feeling that i was pushed off at great speed to become somebody become that individual jimmy go off into the planet and so i ran and i ran and my wife sometimes kids me jimmy you look a bit like forrest gump but i 'm no it 's all about something trust me so i kept running and i kept running and i sort of got somewhere and i sort of stood there and looked around me and i thought well where do i belong where do i fit what am i where am i from i had no idea so whilst going and don 't worry i didn 't when i arrived with these tribes i didn 't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths but what i did find were people that belonged themselves and they inspired me some extraordinary people and i 'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine there 's not many of them left and they 're called the huli wigmen and i want to put them on a pedestal and i said you have something that many people have not seen you sit in this and you know why they 're proud you know why they look like this and the huli have this ritual when they 're teenagers and they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single it 's their huli creation so they 're called the huli wigmen and then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise and don 't worry there are many birds there there 's very few people living so and they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats and it 's built out of scarabs these fantastic emerald green little scarabs and they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs to build these hats so perhaps i have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me and going back into my past to see where i actually fit an extremely important part of this project was about how and it 's basically beauty i think beauty matters we spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty beautiful places beautiful things and ultimately beautiful people very very very significant i 've spent all of my life analyzing what do i look like women between the age of twenty five and thirty is that what beauty is going to be is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant i still get shivers when i think about it i went to a part of the world and i don 't know whether any of you have ever heard of chukotka has anybody ever heard of chukotka chukotka probably is technically as far as one can go and still be on on the living planet and that 's if you get there as you can see some people sort of miss the runway and they 're people i 'd heard about i 'd hardly seen any images of but i knew they were there and i 'd been in touch with this guide and this guide said there 's this fantastic tribe there 's only about forty of them you 'll be okay but then i was not allowed to photograph them they said you cannot photograph us you have to wait until you get to know us you have to wait until you understand us you have to wait until you see how we interact with one another they observed one another but at the same time the children take the old aged and they adore and admire one another and they truly taught me what beauty a little bit of audience interaction this is very important now it may be their nose or their hair but please look at each other give them a compliment you have to be because i 'm running out of time and you have to remember it okay thank you thank you thank you you 've given each other compliments hold it for later and the last thing it was extraordinarily profound and it happened only two weeks ago two weeks ago i went back to the himba now the himba live in northern namibia on the border of angola and i 'd been there a few times before and i 'd gone back to present this book it was very we love each first we destroy then we reflect then we rebuild then we respect i didn 't ever appreciate him for the fact that i 'm probably standing here today because of him these people taught me that we are only who we are because of our parents and our grandparents and our forefathers going on and on and on before that and i so quite a special image and it wasn 't essentially the image i wanted to choose i was sitting it 's an amazing picture you 're in his eyes i said what do you mean i 'm in his eyes it 's a picture of the nenets she said no look look closely you 're in his eyes and when you look closely at this picture there is a reflection of me in so i think perhaps and whilst these pictures look at you i ask you to look at them you may not be reflected in his eyes so if you can briefly reflect on what i was and i need you all to stand for me please and this is not a standing ovation so don 't worry i 'm not fishing for compliments and i know you don 't have any camels you have to stand tall breathe in through your nose no laughing shh breathe through your nose i 'm going to photograph"
