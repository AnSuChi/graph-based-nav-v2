  "transcript": "like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving adam and eve and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between adam and eve nowadays adam and eve would probably act differently about us is being collected by organizations now and my story is about these tradeoffs back in the year two thousand about one hundred billion photos were shot worldwide but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online in two thousand and ten only on facebook in a single in the same span of time computers ' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude improving facial recognizing ability by computers but also and ubiquitous computing which allows my phone which is not a supercomputer to connect to the internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds well and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from facebook profiles by the time the subject reached the last page on the survey the page had been dynamically updated with the ten best matching photos which the recognizer had found and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo do you see the subject the computer did and in fact did so for one out of three subjects we do you see where i 'm going with this so if you combine the two studies together then the question becomes can you start from a face and using facial recognition find a name and publicly available but in fact we even decided to develop an iphone app which uses the phone 's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what i just described to you in real time looking for a match finding public information and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject we didn 't develop the app to make it available just as a proof of concept take these technologies and push to their logical extreme imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their google glasses or one day their contact lenses and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you what will this future without secrets look like and should we care we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate absolutely legal but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online and some had not which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly an example of moral you may be thinking this does not apply to me because i have nothing to hide but in fact privacy is not about having something negative to hide imagine that you are the h r director of a certain organization and you receive rsums therefore you google their names and in a certain universe you or in a parallel universe you find do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview meaning we did exactly that we created facebook profiles manipulating traits then we started sending out rsums now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor but think again why should that be always the case in a movie which came out a few years ago minority report a famous scene had tom cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him now that movie is set in about forty years from now and as exciting as that technology looks it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most and then they create in real time a facial composite of these two friends now so next time you are looking for a certain product and there is an ad it will be one of your and you will not even know that this is happening now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight telling people what you are going to do with their data and in principle that 's a very good thing it 's necessary transparency so in yet another experiment this one with students we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior including pretty sensitive questions such as this one another group of subjects we told them students and faculty will see your answers transparency notification and sure enough this worked in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second it makes sense right but then we added the misdirection we repeated the experiment with the same two groups this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data how long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect ten minutes five minutes one minute how about fifteen seconds fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups now i have to admit that this and certainly not the best way they can be done when someone tells you people don 't care about privacy consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy consider that in the last we can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient not even the nsa we can have even big data while protecting privacy of course these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects which is why perhaps you don 't hear more about them which brings me back to the garden of eden there is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the garden of eden which feeling naked and feeling ashamed you can find echoes of this interpretation in john milton 's paradise lost however they also lack knowledge the moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge they discover themselves they become aware they achieve autonomy in a way is both the means and the price to pay marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them but in fact in a few years organizations will know so much and perhaps there was one english author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort aldous huxley in brave new world he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing in the book he also offers us a way out in the words of the savage regaining autonomy and freedom is possible although the price to pay is steep so i do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information right now many of us do not even know that the fight is going on but it is whether you like it or not and at the risk of playing the serpent i will tell you that the tools for the fight thank you"
