  "transcript": "images like this from the auschwitz concentration camp have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are where we 've come from and the times we live in pol pot rwanda and other genocides and even though the twenty first century is only seven years old we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in darfur and the daily horrors of iraq this has led to a common understanding of our situation namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence violence and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from to our peril where the writer wrote the indian life was a difficult one but there were no employment problems community harmony was what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter now you 're all familiar with this treacle we teach it to our children the original title of this session was everything you know is wrong and i 'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong that in fact our ancestors were far more violent than we are that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species ' existence but i 'm going to try to convince although not homogeneously let me take you on a journey of several powers of ten from the millennium scale to the year scale to try to persuade you of this until ten thousand years ago all humans lived as without permanent settlements or government and this is the state that 's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony but the which is our best source of evidence about this way of life has shown a rather different conclusion here is a graph that he the red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will and they range from a rate of almost a sixty percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to in the case of the gebusi only a fifteen percent the tiny little blue bar in the lower left hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from united states and europe in the twentieth century and includes all the deaths of both world wars if the death rate in tribal warfare we can and in this one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare such as the following from numbers thirty one and moses said unto them ' have you saved all the women alive but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves ' in other words kill the men kill the the children if you see any virgins then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them you can find four or five passages in the bible of this ilk also one sees that the death penalty was the well let 's although we don 't have statistics for warfare throughout the middle ages to modern times we know just from conventional history the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence for example any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment the kind of infraction today that would give you a fine in those days would result in your tongue being cut out your ears being cut off you being blinded a hand being chopped off and so on there were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment burning at the stake disemboweling breaking on the wheel being pulled apart by horses and so on the death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non violent crimes criticizing the king stealing a loaf of bread slavery of course was the preferred and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat howling in pain was burned to death the criminologist manuel eisner hamlet town county that he could find and he supplemented them with national data when nations started keeping statistics he plotted on a logarithmic scale from one hundred deaths per one hundred thousand people per year which was approximately the and the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per one hundred thousand people per year in seven or eight european countries then there is a slight uptick in the the people who said that rock ' n ' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that but there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the middle ages to the present and the elbow occurred in the let 's click down now to the decade scale according to non governmental organizations that keep such statistics there 's been a steep decline in deaths in the yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from one thousand nine hundred and fifty to the present and as you can see the death rate goes down from deaths per conflict per year in to less than two thousand deaths per conflict per year post world homicide and violent crime this is from the fbi uniform crime statistics you can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the ' 50s and the ' 60s then it soared upward for several decades and began a precipitous decline the associated press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the earth than sixteenth century monks were we that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something the higher the probability that you assign to it things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age there are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better laughter there 's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about western culture and of course our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior one of the reasons violence but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards so today we get exercised and rightly so if a appeal process we don 't consider that a couple of hundred years ago they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted ten minutes and indeed that that would have been repeated over and over again today we look at capital punishment as evidence well no one really knows but i have read four explanations all of which i think have some grain of plausibility nasty brutish and short not because he argued humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative but before they invade you more recently thomas schelling and what does he see but a maybe i had better shoot him especially since even if he doesn 't want to kill me he 's probably worrying right now that i might kill him before he kills me and so on hunter gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first with this problem is by deterrence you don 't strike first but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded the only thing is that it 's liable to having its bluff called and therefore can only work if it 's credible to make it credible you must avenge all insults and settle all scores which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta life becomes an episode of the sopranos hobbes ' solution the leviathan was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency a leviathan then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack because any kind of aggression will be punished leaving its profitability zero that would remove the temptation to invade preemptively out of fear of them attacking you first eisner the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in europe coincided with the rise of centralized states so that 's a bit of a support for the leviathan street gangs and so on the second explanation is that in many times and places there is a widespread in earlier times when one puts a higher value on life in general this was an argument from the political scientist james payne a third explanation invokes the concept of game and was worked out in the book nonzero by the journalist robert wright wright points out that in certain circumstances cooperation or non violence can benefit both parties in an interaction such as gains in trade when two two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in by allowing the trade of goods services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people the result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead and violence declines for selfish reasons as wright put it among the many reasons that i think that we should not bomb the japanese is that they built my mini van the fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called the expanding circle by the philosopher peter singer who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy ability to treat other peoples ' interests as comparable to one one 's own unfortunately by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family people outside that circle are treated as sub human and can be exploited with impunity one can see in historical record it expanding from the village to the clan to the tribe to the nation to other races to both sexes and in singer 's own arguments something that we should extend to other sentient species the question is if this has happened what has powered that expansion and there are a number of possibilities such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that robert wright argues for logic of the golden rule the more you think about and interact with other people the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs at least not if you want them to listen to you you can 't say that my interests are special compared to yours anymore than you can say that the particular spot that i 'm standing on is a unique part of the universe because i happen to be standing on it that very minute it may also be powered by and travel and literacy which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub human and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life the sense that there but for fortune go of violence i think has profound implications it why is there peace thank you very much people here in the room would say that that expansion of that you were talking about that peter singer talks about is also driven by just by technology by greater visibility of the other and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller but also i think it helps us i think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the middle ages you think how could they possibly have done it how could they have not have empathized with the person that they 're disemboweling but clearly as far as they 're concerned this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own anything i think that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person ca well steve i would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year i think it 's really important thank you so much"
