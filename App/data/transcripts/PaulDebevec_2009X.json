  "transcript": "biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo real digital human face and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that unlike aliens and dinosaurs we look at human faces every day they are we 're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering and what i 'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably and that 's actually a completely by the end of the talk we 're going to see it move and sit for a session in light stage five this is a fifty six white leds all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions and the lighting that we use these days looks something like this we shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds and we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face and different principle directions of light from the light stage to figure out both fine scale detail of her face if we zoom in on this photograph right here we can see it 's a really nice photograph to have of her because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the we 've actually used polarizers on all the lights just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road polarizers and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point and because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin it doesn 't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out and as a result it 's a very good so if we we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon in many different facial poses and if you take a look at these scans that we have of emily you can see things all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs you can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores you can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there you can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that in addition to this kind of high resolution geometry we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer then instead of looking like a and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called displacement maps that animate as well so the next process was then to animate her we actually so by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer generated performance image metrics is a markerless performance driven animation company we specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films paul debevec and there is the underlying wireframe and that is emily herself"
