  "transcript": "i 've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those i used to dream about when i was little and i can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old encrusted cannon on a shallow and i was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow that was the day i fell in love with the ocean thomas peschak conservation photographer i 've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for national geographic magazine and the save our seas foundation i 've photographed everything from really really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of and i 've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the mozambique channel everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean they are becoming more compressed and more threatened as we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on i 've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand i believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love i guess i 'm a matchmaker uncovering this that is the power of conservation photography i 've visited hundreds of marine locations but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply off south africa 's rugged wild coast and in hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls they drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface they actually coexist in fact dolphins without dolphins the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what i call a sardine donut i know they don 't see me as prey however i get bumped and tail slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy rowdy banquet and during the stormy southwest monsoon manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in baa atoll called hanifaru armies of crustaceans most no bigger than the size of your pupils when plankton concentrations become patchy manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again very much like a puppy chasing its own tail and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next after the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas ' cavernous mouths the experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly and working with ngos like the manta trust my images eventually helped hanifaru become a marine protected area they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the maldivian economy in excess of eight dollars every single year i have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read there be dragons and today the closest i 've come is visiting remote atolls far far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like very few people have heard of bassas da india a tiny speck of coral in the mozambique channel its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for galapagos sharks these sharks are anything but shy even during the day i had a bit of a hunch that they 'd be even never before have i encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop capturing and sharing moments like this i was on assignment for national geographic magazine in baja california and about halfway down the peninsula on the pacific side lies san ignacio lagoon leaving only today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with this species truly has made a remarkable comeback decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse in but what happened next was nothing short of miraculous in two thousand and five but don 't take my word for it come with me swim with me in deep into one of the largest and densest schools of fish i have ever encountered we all have the ability to be creators of hope too late for our oceans and particularly i want to focus on nature 's resilience in the face of seven point three billion people i will have to search much much harder to make photographs like this while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me to thrive and survive in my profession you really have to be a hopeless optimist and i always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change inside the next lagoon or possibly in the one after"
