  "transcript": "if you 're in the audience today or maybe you 're watching this talk in some other time or place you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem whether you 're an artist a technologist a lawyer or a fan the handling of copyright directly impacts your life rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership it 's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies mashups and and more two years ago recording artist chris brown released the official video of his single forever recorded it with her camera phone and uploaded it to youtube within seconds of attempting to upload the video the copy was detected giving sony the choice of what to do next but how do we know that the user 's video was a copy we compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database this heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content and we do this every time that a video is uploaded to youtube and that 's over twenty hours of video every minute when we find a match we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down and the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site it would be like thirty six thousand people staring at remember chris brown 's video but sometime last year a young couple got married this is their wedding video you may have seen it what 's amazing about this is if the processional of the wedding was this much fun can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been i mean who are these people i totally want to go to that wedding so sony is generating revenue from both of these and jill and kevin the happy couple they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral and they 've used it as an opportunity to make a difference the video 's inspired over twenty six thousand dollars in donations to end domestic violence the jk wedding [ entrance ] dance became so popular that nbc parodied it on the season finale of the office which just goes to show by empowering choice we can create a culture of opportunity and all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification so why has no one labels there 's multiple music publishers and each of these can vary by country there 's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together so we have to manage many claims to the same video if you have content that others are uploading to youtube you should register in the content id system and then you 'll have the choice about how your content is used and think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content but it 's not just about dollars and impressions just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology and i think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading"
