  "transcript": "as we shop and travel throughout our cities and around the world and wouldn 't it be great if we could understand all this movement if we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail so it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement is sports so what we 're doing is turning our athletes into it 's hard to deal with and that interesting but there are things that for example basketball coaches want to know and the problem is they can 't know them because they 'd have to watch every second of every game remember it and process it and a person can 't do that but a machine can the problem is a machine can 't see the game with the eye of a coach at least they so we started simply we taught it things like passes shots and rebounds things that most casual fans would know events like post ups and and if you don 't know them that 's okay most casual players probably do so we have taught a machine to see so how have we been able to do this if i asked a coach to describe something like a pick and roll they would give me a description and if i encoded that as happens to be this dance in basketball so there 's the guy on offense without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens and ta da it 's a pick and roll so if the player who 's the called the screener it 's probably not a pick and roll it 's probably not a pick and roll it 's probably not a pick and roll or i could be and that 's what makes it hard so we go to the machine and say good morning machine please find a way to tell the difference and the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate so if i was going to teach it the difference between an apple and and orange i might say why don 't you use color or shape so figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location distance timing that 's really the key to the science of moving dots or as we like to call it spatiotemporal pattern recognition in academic vernacular because the first thing is you have to make it sound hard because it is the key thing is for nba coaches it 's not that they want to know whether a pick and roll happened or not it 's that they want to know how it happened and why is it so important to them so here 's a little insight it turns out is perhaps the most important play so it turns out that this dance has a great many variations and identifying and that 's why we need this to be really really good either roll his teammate can either show or play up to touch or play soft and together they can either switch or blitz and i didn 't know most of these things when i started and it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows it would make our lives a lot but it turns out movement is very very messy people wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified with very very high accuracy both in precision and recall is tough because that 's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you and despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features we have been able to do that coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations we 're at the point where almost every single contender for an nba championship this year is which is built on a machine that understands the moving dots of basketball so not only that we have given advice that has changed strategies that have helped teams and it 's very exciting because you have coaches who 've been in the league for thirty years that are willing to take advice from a machine and it 's very exciting it 's much more than the our computer started out with simple things and learned more and more complex things and now it knows so many things frankly i don 't understand we were wondering can a machine know more than a coach can it know more than person could know and it turns out the answer is we can see where is the shot what 's the angle to the basket we can look at how the player 's moving and we can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances we can take something so here 's a bubble chart because what 's what 's ted without a bubble chart laughter people on the left take difficult shots on the right they take easy shots i can tell you that player takes shots that an average nba player would make forty nine percent of the time and the reason that 's important is that there are lots of 47s out there and so it 's really important to know if the forty seven that you 're considering giving one hundred million dollars to is a good shooter who takes bad shots or a bad shooter who takes good shots so there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago in the nba finals miami was down by three there was twenty seconds left they were about to lose the championship a gentleman named lebron james came up and he took a three to tie he it went into overtime they won the game they won the championship it was one of the most exciting games in basketball and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before now i can 't show you that video but for you we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game about three weeks ago laughter and we recreated the tracking that led to the insights so here is us this is chinatown in los angeles a park we play at every week and that 's us recreating the ray allen moment and all the tracking that 's associated with it so here 's the shot i 'm going to show you that moment and all the insights of that moment miami down three twenty seconds left jeff brings up the that moment had about a nine percent chance of happening in the nba and we know that and a great many other things i 'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to to make that happen the important thing about that video and the insights we have for every second of every nba game it 's not that it 's the fact you don 't have to be a professional team to track movement you do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement in fact it doesn 't even have to be about sports because we 're moving everywhere we 're moving in our homes as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world what will we know what will we learn perhaps instead of identifying pick and rolls a machine can identify the moment and let me know when my daughter takes her first steps perhaps we can learn to better use our buildings better plan our cities i believe thank you very much"
