  "transcript": "cities are the crucible of civilization urbanization has been expanding at an exponential rate in the last two hundred years so that by the second part of this century the planet will be completely dominated by cities finance economies that 's where all these problems come from and the tsunami of problems that we feel we 're facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet here 's some numbers it 's now more than eighty two percent every week for the every week more than a million people negative aspect to them are also the solution because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people creating ideas innovation wealth and so on and so there 's an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities now these my comrades in arms and i 'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together with economies that are growing like this and this and the question is that 's the question but let 's talk about my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities and scientific theory means quantifiable relying on underlying generic that 's the quest is that conceivable is microsoft a great big anthill what do we learn from that we use them metaphorically the dna of a company the metaphorical bullshit or is there serious substance to it and if that is the case how come that it 's very hard to kill a city you and thirty years later it 's surviving very few cities well we understand this very well that is you ask any generic question about this how many trees of a given size what is the size of the canopy what is its growth what is its mortality we have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions and the idea is can we do the same for so the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life is that it is scalable it works over an extraordinary range this is just a tiny range actually it 's us mammals we 're one of these and it can scale over a range of one hundred million in size and that is one of the main reasons life is resilient and robust you scale everybody in this room is scaled that 's called growth here 's how you grew and you see you 're very familiar with this you grow very quickly and then you stop and that line there and you see it stops growing very very good for biology also one of the reasons for its great resilience very very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm this is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us hockey sticks this is a bunch of software companies so how do we understand this so let 's first talk about biology this is explicitly showing you how things scale and this is a truly remarkable graph what is plotted here is metabolic rate how much energy you need per day to stay alive versus your weight your mass for all of us bunch of organisms and what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe there 's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this it 's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms each subsystem each cell type each something else is going on which is less than one and we call that sublinear and here 's the point of that it says that that if it were linear the you actually only need seventy five percent more energy so a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale the bigger you are systematically according to very rules less energy per capita now there is an extraordinary regularity so you tell me the size of a mammal i can tell you at the ninety percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology and the reason for this is because of networks all of life and here 's the summary of what i 'm saying this idea of networks and you apply universal principles principles all of these scalings and all of these constraints including the description of the forest the description of your circulatory system diffusion of oxygen and resources across etc etc but they are networks and the most important network of cities is you cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions our interactions and the clustering and grouping of individuals this shows that in this very simple example which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size plotted in the same way as the biology you see exactly the same kind of thing there is a scaling that is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size but here 's what 's always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree and it 's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on but even more surprising the top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way and the bottom one is you lot and what you see is a scaling phenomenon but most important in this the exponent the analog to that three quarters for the metabolic rate is bigger than one it 's about one point one five to one point two unlike biology higher wages more super creative people per capita as you get bigger and here they 're all plotted together just to show you what we plotted here is income gdp gdp of the city and here 's the statement if you double the size of a city from one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand from a million to two million ten to twenty million anything you can think of and you have a fifteen percent savings on no doubt is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities because they think wealth income is what attracts them forgetting about the ugly and the bad well i don 't have time to tell you about all the mathematics but underlying this this fifteen percent rule is true no matter where you on the planet japan portugal something universal is going on and it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions so there it is if it 's social networks with super linear scaling more per capita then the theory says that you increase the pace of life the bigger you showing that increase economies of scale you grow fast and then stop part of our that would be bad for economies and cities and indeed one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation then and the catch is that well we 've done it before what we do is as we grow and we approach the collapse a major innovation takes place and we start over again as we approach the next one and so on so there 's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster we have to accelerate on a continuous basis so lastly i 'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies anything you like there it is after some little fluctuations at the beginning when companies are innovating indicating that they 're dominated not by i could have predicted the size of walmart if it has this sublinear scaling the theory says we should have so if i 'd have done this in i could have predicted what walmart would be now and then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies there they they all start looking like hockey sticks they all bend over and they all die like you and me thank you"
