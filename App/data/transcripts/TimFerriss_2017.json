  "transcript": "and i remember exactly where i was about a week and when i decided i was going to commit suicide and the only reason i took my finger off the trigger was thanks to a few lucky which has proven to be a good investment i 've had and i 've learned a lot i would share my recipe for avoiding self destruction and certainly and the tool i 've found which has proven to be the most reliable safety net for emotional free fall is actually that sounds boring you might think of spock or it might conjure and image like this a cow standing in the rain it 's not say bill belichick head coach of the new england patriots who and stoicism has spread like wildfire in the top of the nfl ranks as a means of mental toughness training in the last few years might not think of george washington actually had a play about a stoic so why would people of action focus so much on an ancient philosophy this seems very and it all started so around three hundred bc someone named zeno of citium taught many lectures walking around a painted porch but for our purposes chief among them was training yourself to separate what you can control from what you cannot control which can be a superpower you miss a pass you get furious with yourself that could cost you a game if you 're that could cost you the employee and there are many tools in the toolkit to get you there i 'm going to focus on one that completely changed my life in two thousand and four it found me then because of two things a very close friend and she didn 't give me a dear john letter but she did give me this a dear john plaque i 'm not making this up i 've kept it i was using stimulants to get going i was using depressants to wind down and go to sleep it was a disaster i felt completely trapped which was we suffer more often in imagination than in reality by seneca the younger who that took me to his letters which took me to the exercise means the pre meditation of evils in simple terms this is visualizing the worst case scenarios in detail preventing you from taking action so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis i needed to capture my thoughts on paper so i created a written exercise that i called like goal setting for myself it consists of three pages super simple the first page is right here what if i asking for a could be anything for me it was taking my first vacation in four years where i could stay in a friend 's room for free to either remove myself as a bottleneck in the business or shut it down in the first column define you 're writing down all of the worst things you can imagine happening if you take that step number two i 'll miss a letter from the irs and i 'll get audited or raided or shut down or some such and then you go to the prevent column in that column you write down the answer to what could i do to prevent each of these bullets from happening or at the very i could take a portable blue light with me and use it for fifteen minutes in the morning i knew that helped stave off depressive episodes i could change the mailing address on file with the irs so the paperwork would go to my accountant easy peasy then we go to repair so scenarios happen what could you do to repair the damage even a little bit or who could you ask for help so in fly to spain get some sun undo the damage if i got into a funk in the case of missing a letter from the irs i could call a friend who is a lawyer or ask say a professor of law what they how had people handled this in the past chances are the answer is yes the second page is simple what might be the benefits of an attempt or a partial success you can see we 're so if you attempted whatever you 're considering might you build confidence develop skills spend ten to fifteen minutes on this page three this might be the most important so don 't skip it the cost of inaction humans are very good at considering what might go if we try something new say ask for a raise what we don 't often consider is the atrocious cost of the status quo so you should ask yourself if i avoid this action or decision and actions and decisions like it what might my life look like twelve months three years any further out it starts to seem intangible and really get detailed again physically whatever and when i did this it painted a terrifying picture and i realized that inaction was no longer an option for me those are the three pages that realized that on a scale of one to ten one being minimal impact ten being maximal impact if i took the trip i was risking a one to three of temporary and reversible pain for an eight to ten of positive life changing impact that could be a semi permanent i was able to extricate myself from the business i ended up extending that trip for a year and a half around the world and i can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted back to doing fear setting at least once a quarter it 's not a panacea you 'll find that easy but it can make a lot of them easier i gregorek he is a four time world champion in olympic weightlifting he can still kick my ass and probably most asses in this room he which was a nonviolent movement for social change that was violently suppressed by the government he lost his career as a firefighter then his mentor a priest was kidnapped tortured killed and so pay attention he is a terse dude when he stood up how he had used stoicism and something and you can apply to everything easy choices hard life asking saying whether it 's in your own head or with other people where in your lives right now might defining your keeping in mind all the while the words of seneca we suffer more often in imagination than in reality thank you very much"
