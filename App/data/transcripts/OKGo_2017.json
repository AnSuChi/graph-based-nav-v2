  "transcript": "'s eyes we are ok go and we 've been together as a band since one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight so we will play along with another one of those in a few minutes but in the meantime we want to address this question that we get asked all the time and once we set up an obstacle course out of thousands of musical instruments in the desert and then played them by stunt driving a car through them for one of the videos we and then so it 's all of these ideas that people are curious about and the reason we 've had so much trouble describing how we think of these ideas is that it doesn 't really feel like we think of them at all it feels like we find them and by way of explanation well i have a compulsive habit i play parallax and perspective games with my eyes pretty much all the time and it 's something i 've been doing since i was a teenager and i think the big contributing factor may have been that this is how i decorated my high school bedroom laughter and being a teenager what i did in there of course was just talk on the phone for and i guess just the overload in general my my brain kind of tried to make sense of it and i would and my thumb would bounce back and forth between jimi hendrix 's left eye and his right it was not a conscious thing of course this is just and it 's still something i do all the time this is my wife kristin yeah woo mid sentence and when she stops is when i that i 'm the one who 's acting weird because i 'm like bobbing and weaving and what i 'm trying to do is get that ficus back there to stick out of her head like a ponytail laughter the point of telling you all this is that for me this is what it feels like to have an idea it 's like they 're made of these disparate parts these disparate chunks sort of floating out there and if and crucially if you 're in exactly the right place you can get them to just so if you get used to if it 's your job to think of ideas this way they 'll start beckoning to you the way that jimi 's eyes beckoned from that poster or the ficus beckons from behind kristin 's head writing music feels like that process just over and over again like you 've got a bunch of sounds or a groove or a chord progression and you 're just looking for that thing on the other side it doesn 't feel like you thought up that puzzle piece it feels like and there 's always a component of surprise to wonder because the process that we all use to make stuff it actually has a very strong bias against surprising ideas the process i 'm talking about is the one you all know we all do it all the time you think of an idea you just sit and think of your brilliant idea and then you come up with a plan for how you 're going to make that idea happen and then with that plan in mind you go back and double check your original idea and maybe revise it and then bouncing back and forth between the idea and the plan the plan and the idea eventually you come up with a truly great plan and then once you have that and only then do you go out and this is like this is sort of a flawless system in terms of maximizing your resources because this but there are problems with this and math will help us reveal the biggest one go back to that video that we just showed you that rube goldberg machine it had about one hundred and thirty interactions in it that was one hundred and thirty things so let 's let 's assume that we want to make a new video now similarly complex one hundred and thirty moving parts if we 're really good planners in that system it seems like ninety percent sounds good right it 's not it 's terrible actually the numbers say so the chance of getting all one hundred and thirty things to not fail at the same time is 9 for ninety percent to the 130th power so calculate that out and you get literally one in a million i mean that 's not a gamble i want to take so let 's ratchet up that reliability to ninety nine percent power is percent significantly less daunting like this might even be usable but really think about that how many parts of your lives are and could you really get one hundred and thirty of them all in one place at once and if you really could doesn 't it seem like you deserve to succeed like that is it actually fails three times more often than it succeeds so the upshot of all this is that if your project is pretty complex like you know every ambitious project is if you 've got a lot of moving parts you 're basically constrained to just reshuffling so now go back to me sitting with my thumb in the air trying to line up something surprising if the only things i 'm allowed to consider in the first place are ideas that have already been done over and over and over again i am screwed so what we do is we try to identify some place where there might just be a ton of those untried ideas we try to find a sandbox gamble a whole bunch of our resources on getting in that sandbox and playing so some of the sandboxes that we 've started videos with let 's play with optical illusions let 's try to dance on moving surfaces let 's 's try to make toast with a laser cutter or let 's do something in one of those zero gravity airplanes but then instead of actually trying to sit there and think out what that something is we spent a full third of our budget at this point we don 't yet know what our idea is we don 't have a plan so we 're because then if we can do the bob and weave thing if we can put our thumbs up and get just a few things to line up because from our perspective it doesn 't feel like we thought of it at all it just feels like we found it so we 'll play another video for you now and the song along with it this is for the song the one moment and for this one the sandbox was ballistics and math i spent a full month putting together a giant spreadsheet for this it was like my playspace was four hundred lines long and twenty five columns wide which i presume that if anybody is going to understand that it 's this crowd nothing is better than a giant spreadsheet right well very much we are ok go and this is called the one moment and while our bones keep looking back at the overgrowth that 's swallowing the path the grace of god go we remember and this will be the one moment"
