  "transcript": "my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously on a collective level and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness and when we do these kind of things when three hundred million people do unconscious behaviors then it can add up to a catastrophic this is an image i just recently completed that is when you stand back at a distance it looks like some kind of neo gothic cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution it starts looking like lots of pipes like maybe a chemical plant or a refinery or maybe a which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the united states every six hours we use four million cups a day on airline flights and virtually none of them are reused or recycled they just don 't do that in that industry i couldn 't fit forty million cups on a canvas but i was able to put four hundred and ten thousand and if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life that 's the size it would be and there 's a day 's worth of our cups you can still see the little people way down there that 's as high as a 42 story building and i put the statue of liberty in there as a scale reference has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on earth one out of four people one out of four humans in prison and that 's gone up since then but we don 't have the numbers yet so i wanted to show two point three million prison uniforms and and to show two point three million of them every time i look at this this piece i always wonder if my mom 's whispering to my dad he finally folded his laundry i wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of americans who die from cigarette smoking and so this piece is made up of lots and lots of called skull with cigarette and will continue to reverberate through and every single day since then one thousand one hundred americans have died and today one thousand one hundred americans are dying from cigarette smoking and we aren 't talking about it and knowing what we know which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month and every month in the u s more than seven hundred thousand children in the united states aged eighteen and under begin smoking every year one more strange epidemic in the united states that that i want to acquaint you with is this this is an image i 've made out of lots and lots of vicodin well actually i only had one vicodin that i scanned scanned lots and lots of times and so as you stand back you see two hundred and thirteen thousand vicodin pills which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the united states attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and and anti anxiety medications this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery american it 's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift given to young girls who are about to go off to college so i made this image and so as you stand back which represents the number the vast majority of those are on women under the age of twenty one and strangely enough the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction and most of that is being done by men i 'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues and the reason that i do this it 's because there 's this kind of anesthesia in america at the moment we 've lost our sense of outrage our anger and our grief about what 's going on in our culture right now what 's going on in our country the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world and one of the the causes of this i think is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind this holographic image that we 're all trying to create in our mind of of the interconnection of things the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers and these are numbers that our brain just doesn 't have the ability to comprehend and to translate them into a more universal visual language that can be felt because my belief is if we can feel these issues if we can feel these things more deeply then they 'll matter to us and if we can find that then we 'll be able to find within each one of us what it is that we need to find to face the big question which is how do we change that to me is the big question and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of and that is our own behavior my belief is that you don 't have to make yourself bad then we have a choice the degree of integrity that each of us can can bring to the surface to bring to this question the depth of character that we can summon as we show up for the question of how do we change and it will continue to do that on into the future and it will profoundly affect the well being the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit i 'm speaking this is who we are in this room right now in this moment"
