  "transcript": "been blown away by the whole thing in fact i 'm leaving there have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what i want to talk about one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity just the variety of it and the range of it the second is that it 's put us in a place where we have no idea what 's going to happen in terms of the future no idea what i find is everybody has an interest in education don 't you and you say you work in education actually you 're not often at dinner parties you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face because it 's one of those things that goes deep with people am i right like religion and money and other things so if you think of it children nobody has a clue despite all the expertise that 's been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years ' time and the third part of this is that we 've all agreed nonetheless on the really extraordinary capacities that children have their capacities for and but i think she 's not what you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent and we squander them pretty ruthlessly so i want to talk about education and we should treat it with the same status a great story recently of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson she was six and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did the teacher was fascinated she went and the girl said i 'm drawing a picture of god and the teacher said but nobody knows what god looks like and the girl said they will in a minute when my son was four being strict about it wherever he went he was four that year he was in the nativity play do you remember the story no it was big it mel gibson did the sequel you may have seen it nativity ii but we had the place crammed full of agents in joseph he didn 't have to speak but you know the bit where the three kings come in because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said and the second boy said i bring you myrrh and the third boy said frank sent this what these things have in common is that kids will take a have a go they 're not frightened of being wrong i don 't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative you 'll never come up with anything original and by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity and we run our companies like this we stigmatize mistakes 're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities i believe this passionately so why is this i lived in stratford on avon until about five years ago in fact we moved from stratford to los angeles so you can imagine what a seamless transition that was laughter actually we lived in a place called snitterfield just outside stratford which is where shakespeare 's father was born are you struck by a new thought i was you don 't think of shakespeare having a father do i mean he was seven at some point he was in somebody 's english class being sent to bed by his he didn 't want to come to los angeles he loved it but he had a girlfriend in england this was the love of his he was really upset on the plane he said i 'll never find another girl like sarah and we were rather pleased about that frankly laughter because she was the main reason we were leaving the country but something strikes you when you move to america and travel around the world every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance there isn 't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics why i think math is very important but so is dance children dance all the time if they 're allowed to we all do we all have bodies don 't we did i miss a meeting if you were to visit education as an alien and say what 's it for public education who really succeeds by this who does everything that they should who gets all the brownie points who are the winners i think you 'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors isn so there we shouldn 't hold them up as the high water mark of all human achievement they 're just they 're disembodied you know in a kind of literal way they look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads getting their head to meetings if you want real evidence of out of body experiences and pop into the discotheque on the final night and there you will and there 's a reason they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas number one so you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid things you liked on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that don 't do music you 're not going to be a musician don 't do art you won 't be an artist benign advice now profoundly mistaken the whole world is engulfed in a revolution and the second is academic ability which has really or was actually stigmatized and i think we can 't afford to go on that way in the next thirty years according to unesco suddenly degrees aren 't worth anything isn if you had a degree you had a job if you didn 't have a job it 's because you didn 't want one didn 't want one frankly we know three things about intelligence one it 's diverse we we think in sound we think kinesthetically if you look at the interactions of a human brain as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive the brain isn 't divided into compartments in fact creativity which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things there 's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum it 's thicker in women following off from helen yesterday this is probably why women are better at no she 's dealing with people on the phone she 's talking to the kids she 's painting the ceiling she 's the door is shut the kids are out the phone 's on the hook if she comes in i get annoyed i say terry please i 'm trying to fry an egg in here give me a break laughter actually do you know that old philosophical thing if a tree falls in a in a forest and nobody hears it did it happen if a man speaks his mind in a forest and no woman hears him is he still wrong and the third thing about intelligence is it 's distinct i 'm doing a new book at the moment called epiphany which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent i 'm fascinated by how people got to be there really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of gillian lynne have you heard of her some have she 's a choreographer and everybody knows her work she did cats and phantom of the opera she 's wonderful i used to be on the board of the royal ballet as you can see anyway gillian and i had lunch one day and i said how did you get to be a and the school in the ' 30s wrote to her parents and said we think gillian has a learning disorder she couldn 't concentrate she was fidgeting i think now they 'd say she had and she was there with with her mother and she was led and sat on this chair at the end and she sat on her hands for twenty minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems gillian was having at school because she was disturbing people her homework was always late and so on little kid of eight in the i need to speak to her privately and when they got out he said to her mother just stand and watch her and and they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said she 's a dancer take her to a dance school i said what happened she said she did i can 't tell you how wonderful it was we walked in this room and it was full of people like me people who couldn 't sit still people who had to move to think who had to move to she eventually graduated from the royal ballet school and she 's a multi millionaire somebody else might have put her on medication and what i think it comes to is this al gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered i believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip mine the earth for a particular commodity it won 't serve us we have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we 're educating our children there was a wonderful quote by jonas salk who said within fifty years all life on earth would end within fifty years all forms of life would flourish we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we 've talked about and the only way we 'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are but they will thank you very much"
