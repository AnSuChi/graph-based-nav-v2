  "transcript": "ever since i was a kid i 've had massive collections of random stuff everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that i 've captured and put in jars 's no secret because i like collecting things that i love the natural history museum and the collections of animals at the natural history museum in dioramas but the problem with this is that my friends aren 't quite keen on the idea of me so what i did was i filmed six of my friends which was these six friends projected into jars so now i have this collection of my friends i can take around with me whenever i go and this is called animalia chordata from the latin nomenclature for and they actually move around laughter so this is interesting to me but it lacked a certain human element it they react to you in different ways you know just like people on the street when and some people hide from you and also adding interactivity to sculpture i documented forty of my other so i wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something and the way i did this was actually by projecting a 1950s housewife into a blender and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art you may never experience the entire thing yourself you can walk away you can just watch as this as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you or you can actually choose to interact with it so if you do choose to interact with the with the piece and you press the blender button it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment by doing that you are now part of my piece you like the people that are trapped in my work have become part of my work as well but but i put my friends in jars i put this this character this sort of endangered species character in a blender you 'll actually transform the baby into a toddler the piece goes black and is not to be so in doing so you 're erasing time and hopefully one day i 'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars"
