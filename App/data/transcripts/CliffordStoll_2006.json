  "transcript": "i 'm delighted to be here i 'm honored by the invitation and thanks i would love to talk about stuff that i 'm interested in but unfortunately i suspect that what i 'm interested in won 't interest many other people but i suspect that the number of so i 'm not going to talk about that it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six and one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven when a computer hacker is breaking into our our systems and i caught the guys and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb and stealing information and selling it and i 'd love to talk about that and it 'd be fun twenty years later it 's tedious i 'm it 's science going to talk about that nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book silicon snake oil i feel that there 's a massive my idea is and keep them out of schools but i think the argument is so obvious to anyone who 's hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn 't need much talking about but i guess i may be very wrong about that and everything having said that i outlined my talk about the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future i 'm supposed to talk about the future yes to talk about the future is bizarre because i 've got gray hair and so it 's kind of silly for me to talk about the future in fact i think that if you really want to know what the future 's going to be if you really want to know about the future don 't ask a technologist a scientist a don 't ask somebody who 's writing code no if you want to know what society 's going to be like in twenty years ask a kindergarten teacher they know in fact don 't ask just any kindergarten teacher ask an experienced one they 're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation i suspect do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring certainly all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and and and the change that is happening is not one that is in software but that 's not what i 'm going to talk about i 'd love to talk about it it 'd be fun but right over here what i 'd like to talk about is one sided things i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side because i not only love mobius loops but i 'm one of the very few people if right away i hope that all of your eyes glaze over this is a klein bottle for those it 's a bottle whose inside is its outside it has zero volume and has wonderful properties if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together you get one of these and i make them out of glass but i don 't in ted of course stands for design just two weeks ago i made you know i 've been making medium and big klein bottles for the trade but what i 've just made and i 'm delighted to show you first time in public here this is a klein bottle wine bottle which although in four dimensions it shouldn 't be able to hold any fluid at all it 's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions and because our universe is only three spatial dimensions it can hold fluids it 's highly but i 'm not going to passed away last summer could somebody put this this guy up sitting in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine in front of and oh yeah and it sent me back the inventor of the moog synthesizer who passed away this past august robert moog was a generous kind person extraordinarily competent engineer a musician he 'd come up from trumansburg to teach me i 'm studying physics at the time this is one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine seventy seventy one we 're studying physics i 'm studying physics and he 's saying that 's a good thing to do don 't get caught up in electronic music if you 're doing physics he 'd come up and spend he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school bob moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show greg flint and i things about this we sat around talking about fourier modulation transfer functions stuff like this bob 's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us anyone who 's a musician has been profoundly influenced by robert moog and i what i 'm about to do i hope you can recognize that that 's what i 'd like to feel that the best way i can help out anything is to so ph d this and several of them would come up to me how come you ain 't over here on the front lines put your money where you mouth is i teach eighth grade science four days a week not just showing up every now and i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do not just show up to class every now and then teach a solid week okay i 'm teaching three quarters time but college level physics no calculus i 'll cut out that you won 't need to know trig going to be doing genuine physics and that 's one of the things i thought i 'd do right now before i even turn that on one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class this is through the lens and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light my students in el cerrito how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light i was all set to do it and i was thinking aw man i was just going to impose upon impose upon the powers that be and measure all set to do it i 'm all set to do it maybe i 'll measure the speed of light but meanwhile let 's measure the speed of sound well the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo but probably one of my students ariel [ unclear ] could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation and all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength when the frequency goes up the wavelength comes down wavelength goes up frequency goes down so if we have that 's what 's interesting things stretch out right all of you know this from eighth grade remember what they didn 't tell you in physics in eighth grade physics but they should have and i wish they had was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light you get a constant and that constant is the speed of sound so in order to measure the speed of sound all i 've got to do set it up to so i know the frequency it 's one so anytime i talk you 'd see it on the screen i and as i move this away from the source you 'll notice the spiral the slinky moves the wave coming out this way those of you who are physicists i hear you rolling your eyes but bear with me to measure the wavelength all i need to do is measure the distance from here from here to here is the wavelength of sound so i 'll put a measuring tape here i 've moved the microphone twenty centimeters zero point two meters from here let 's figure out what this is one point seven six times zero point two over here is three hundred and fifty two meters per second if you look it up in the book it 's really really three hundred and forty three but here with kludgy material and lousy drink we 've been able to measure the speed of sound to not bad pretty good all of which comes to what i wanted to say go back to resnick and halliday i 'm going home for a midterm a riot 's going on on campus there 's a riot hey elmo 's done off cop comes and looks at me and says you you 're a student and a tear gas canister the size of a pepsi can goes i get a breath of tear gas and i can 't breathe this cop comes after me with a rifle he wants to clunk me over the head i can i duck into chases me into this room i slam the door behind me climb up go past this place where i see a pendulum ticking and i 'm thinking oh yeah the square root of the length is proportional to its period i keep climbing up go back i go to a place where a dowel splits off clock clock clock the time 's going backwards because i 'm inside of it i 'm thinking of lorenz contractions and einsteinian relativity shooting tear gas and watching students throwing bricks then i remember what namely that i 'm asking myself why am i"
