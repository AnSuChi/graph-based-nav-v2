  "transcript": "a message from tens of thousands of people in the villages in the slums in the hinterland of the country who have solved problems through their own genius without any outside help when our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of india about two hundred districts that he mentioned were ungovernable the point that we have been stressing for the last the point that the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds that is the message which we started thirty one years ago and what did it start let me just tell you briefly my personal journey which led me to come to this point in ' eighty five ' eighty six i was in bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work which are based on the knowledge of the people i came back in ' eighty six i had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that i found in that country which had sixty percent landlessness i started looking at my own work the work that i had done almost every time had instances of knowledge that people had shared now and i looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself is there a line in my return which shows how much of this income gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible was it because i 'm brilliant that i 'm getting this reward or because of the revolution is it that i write very well is it that i articulate very well is it that i analyze the data very well is it because i 'm a professor and therefore i must be entitled to this reward from society i tried to convince myself that will become more responsive to the needs of the poor poor and therefore i think it 's okay but it appeared to me that all these years that i 'd been working on exploitation exploitation by landlords by moneylenders by traders gave me an insight that probably i was also an exploiter no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me and nothing ever went back to them so much so that much of my work till that time was in the english language the getting rent from that knowledge getting consultancies and whatever have you so then a dilemma rose in the mind that if i 'm also an exploiter then this is not right life cannot go on like that and this was a moment of great pain and read about one hundred papers and one day i don 't know what happened while coming back from the office towards home maybe i saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if i only could be like the honey bee life would be wonderful pollinates another flower cross pollinates and when it takes the nectar the flowers don 't feel shortchanged in fact they invite the and the bees don 't keep all the honey for themselves these are the three guiding principles of the honey bee network that whenever we learn something from people they must not remain anonymous i have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art that is a great tragedy which i 'm carrying still with me and i hope that all of you will carry this with you that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them the research guidelines of u s national academy of sciences or research councils of the u k or of indian councils of science research do not require that is fair and just and we don 't even do justice in the knowledge market and india wants to be a knowledge society so obviously you cannot have two principles of justice one for you cannot discriminate you cannot be in favor of your own values which are at look at this picture can you tell me where has it been taken from and it been used for what has it been used for you know you 're so right we must give him a hand it invites tourists to see the shame of our country i 'm so sorry to say that is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture it depends upon how you look at the life of the people if you cannot be celebrating that millions of women still carry water on their do not ask this question you must have taken tea in the morning you know what the action is the action is the lady picks up a few leaves puts them in the basket and she does it a few and you will eat today is transplanted by women bending when they transplant paddy and that infection pains because point nine percent of the paddy is transplanted manually no machines have been developed so the silence of scientists we have a program for employment one million people have to be given jobs for one hundred days by this great country doing what breaking stones digging earth so we asked a question to the parliament do poor have heads nameless person this is what honey bee network is about and this network grew voluntarily continues to be voluntary and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world they could be creative in terms of education they may be creative in terms of culture they may be creative in terms of institutions but a lot of our work is in the field of technological in terms of contemporary innovations or in terms of traditional knowledge and it all begins with curiosity he had a wish and he said if my wish gets fulfilled somebody was sick and he had to monitor somebody was talking yesterday about maslowian hierarchy there could be nothing more wrong than the maslowian model of hierarchy of and they had a great reason person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something look at this we saw it so on the wayside we found these dung cakes and she 's so we had a shodh yatra and we were walking in the land where gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy pain of indigo growers bhabi mahato in purulia and the whole wall is her canvas she 's sitting there with a broom they will be paid for what they are good at not what they 're bad at look at what rojadeen has done lot of people who sell tea on the shack and now he gives you espresso coffee jahangir has done a so this fellow is bringing a flour grinding machine on a two wheeler if you have five hundred grams one thousand one kilogram he will grind it for it for you the flourmill they have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy in terms of cost in terms of quality but to be able to give them high quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs and that is what sheikh jahangir washing machine he is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep now what we need is we need people who will be able to scale them up look at this somebody from india would know it 's a maybe this is less than a dollar and this is non stick it is coated with one of these you eat it was not meant for that it is safer they you can afford a better she developed a herbal pesticide formulation we filed the patent for her the national innovation foundation and who knows somebody will license this technology now let me mention one thing i think we need a polycentric model of development where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country in different parts of the world would solve the needs of locality greater is the chance of scaling up in the scaling up there 's an inherent inadequacy to match so why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch things can scale up and they have scaled up so what we 're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability there must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality and yet one can be able to fund them one of the greatest studies that we 've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question what is a scalable model as if the need of a community which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places has no legitimate right to get them for free because it 's not part of a larger scale long tail model tells you that small sales having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model and we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio will invest in the portfolio where different innovations will go to to a small number of people in their localities and yet the overall platform of the an amazing man at the age of seventy he is linking up something very creative but he stills sells at this age honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood because and we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in mumbai where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk twenty kilometers wading in the water that look you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go where your transport not go so we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device as a vending device during the floods in eastern india when you have to deliver things to people in different unfortunately is no more but he has left a message a very powerful message many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms rather than only a few because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her [ unclear ] would climb on that so you know we are advancing the frontiers of science you can go to the youtube and find india innovates and then you will find these videos innovation by her when she was in class person one and a half foot height only but he has modified a two wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and we were talking about my friends in brazil how we scale up this model in china and brazil and we have a very vibrant network in china particularly none of us should be parochial none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country no we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people wherever they are and look at this and we had taken our innovators and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in south africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have and this is a donkey cart which they modified there 's an axle here of thirty forty kg serving no purpose this is in china this girl needed a breathing apparatus but they tried to find out how can we use they used a cycle they put together a breathing and this breathing apparatus now saved the life and she 's very welcome there 's a whole range of innovations that we have a car which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer this lady she used to do the winding of the yarn for pochampally saree in one day eighteen thousand times she had to do and i will move the world i will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity a whole range of things we have sold things all over the world from ethiopia to turkey to u s to wherever and here a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the send it back to us so creativity counts knowledge matters"
