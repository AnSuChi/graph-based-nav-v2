  "transcript": "there 's an actor called dustin hoffman and years ago he made this movie which some of you may have heard of called the graduate and there 's two key scenes in that movie the first one is the seduction scene i 'm not going to talk about that tonight and of course all of you know what that word is it 's plastics laughter and the only problem with that is it was completely the let me tell you why it was so wrong the word should have been silicon and the reason it should have been silicon is because the basic patents for semiconductors and they were already building them so had the graduate heard the right one word maybe he would have ended up onstage oh i don 't know maybe with these two laughter so as you 're thinking of that let 's see what bit of advice we might want to give so that your next graduate doesn 't become a tupperware salesman word of advice would you give people when you took a college graduate out by the pool and you said one word just one word i think the answer would be lifecode so what the various ways we have of programming life so instead of programming computers we 're using things to program viruses or retroviruses or proteins or dna or and as you 're thinking about this incredible ability to make life do what you want it to do what it 's programmed to do what you end up doing matching all kinds of this humble mustard weed has been modified you 're really going to a place where people have been changing the lifecode beginning to practice intelligent design that means that instead of doing this at random and seeing what happens over generations lifecode and that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens let me just give you one example so we think it 's perfectly normal and natural to change it but in today 's world sex plus pill equals no baby and again we think that 's perfectly normal and natural but that has not been the case for most of human history like art not in the sense of painting and sculpture but in the sense of assisted reproductive and when you do in vitro fertilization there 's very good reasons to do it sometimes but when you do that what youre doing is separating sex and as you 're thinking of other things we 've been doing think about and what but if you can save them and you can freeze them and you can have a surrogate mother it means that you 've decoupled sex from time it means you can have twins born oh in fifty years in a hundred years two hundred years years perhaps even of evolving ourselves it 's something that steve gullans and i have been thinking about for a while 's have some risks remember the greek myth where some of these treatments actually end up changing your blood type or they 'll put male cells in a female body which sounds absolutely horrible until you realize the reason you 're doing that is you 're substituting bone marrow during cancer treatments here 's something that happened twenty years ago and that 's not particularly extraordinary except that she 's the first human being born to three parents why because she had a deadly mitochondrial disease so when you swap out a third person 's dna and you put it in there you save the lives of people but you also are doing germline engineering which means her kids if she has kids will be saved the we study this for a while so as we think about it as we take the time to say hey maybe we should have longer studies maybe we should do this maybe we should do that there are consequences to acting and there are consequences to not acting like curing deadly diseases which the way is completely unnatural it is normal and natural for humans to be felled by massive epidemics of polio of smallpox of tuberculosis when we put vaccines into people we are putting unnatural things into their body because we think the benefit we can feed about seven we can do things like create new life forms until you realize that those life forms live on your dining room table those flowers you 've got on your dining room table there 's not a lot that 's natural about them because people have been breeding the flowers to make this color to be this size to last for a week you don 't usually give what all this does has now been flipped on its head and what we 've done is created this completely parallel evolutionary system where we are practicing unnatural selection and this is unnatural selection laughter so what happens with this stuff is we started breeding wolves thousands of years ago in central asia but if you take one of the chihuahuas you see in the herms bags on fifth avenue you can watch natural selection happen few things on earth are less natural nothing else living there when you do a cornfield you 're selecting what lives and what dies and you 're doing that through unnatural selection it 's the same with a wheat field it 's the same with a rice field it half the surface of earth has been unnaturally engineered so that what lives and what dies there how about this random mutation stuff well this is random mutation this is antonio alfonseca he 's otherwise known as the octopus his nickname he was the relief pitcher of the year in two thousand and he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers on which turns out to be really useful if you 're a pitcher how about non random mutation how many times have you walked through the forest and found all natural cheese or all natural yogurt so we 've been engineering this stuff now the interesting we found one of the single most powerful instruments crispr inside yogurt and as we start engineering cells we 're producing eight out of the top ten pharmaceutical products it really is a way of programming stuff and there 's nothing that 's going to change us more than this lifecode so as you 're thinking of lifecode let 's think of five principles as to how we start guiding and i 'd love you to give me more the reason we have to take responsibility this is what we are doing what we are choosing it 's not stuff happened it didn 't happen at random it didn 't come down by a verdict of somebody else we engineer this stuff you break it you own it there have been at least thirty three versions of hominids that have walked around this earth most all of them went extinct except us which is why most of us have some neanderthal in us some of us have some denisova in us and some in washington have a lot more of it principle number three we have to respect other people diversity is not a bad thing because even though we think of humans as very diverse we came so close to extinction that all of us descend from a single african mother and the consequence of that is there 's more genetic diversity principle number four we should take about a quarter of the earth and only let darwin run the show there it doesn but we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet and it 's just really important to have these two things running in parallel and not overwhelm evolution last thing i 'll say this is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on this is the single greatest superpower humans have ever had it would be a crime for you not to participate in this stuff because you 're scared of it because you 're hiding from it it would be a crime for all of us not to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool just one word if you don 't listen if that word is"
