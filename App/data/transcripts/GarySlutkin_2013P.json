  "transcript": "i moved to somalia from san francisco and my goodbye greeting from the chief of infectious diseases at san francisco general was gary this is the biggest mistake you 'll ever make but i landed in a refugee situation that had a million refugees and there were six of us doctors there and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera so it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that i was responsible for and in order to do this work we of course because of the limitation in health workers had to recruit refugees to be a specialized new category of health worker following three years of work in somalia got picked up by the world health organization and got assigned to the epidemics of aids my primary responsibility was uganda but also i worked in rwanda and burundi which was responsible for designing interventions i wanted to come home i in and i 'd heard the women wailing and crying in the desert and i wanted to come home and take a break i was not aware of any epidemic problems in america and how many of you have such a situation laughter and some of them many of them actually had water that came into more than one room and i noticed that they would move this little thermoregulatory device to change the temperature in their home by one degree and there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent we who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued it was not a main driver of behavior nor was it a main driver of behavior change and besides it reminded me of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science hadn 't been there before epidemics of plague or typhus or leprosy and widows were dragged around the moat and dungeons were part of the solution the other explanation or but we 'd also realized in treating other processes and problems that sometimes you don 't need to treat everything and so the frequently a strategy has to be rethought but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers but i began to ask questions and search out and the maps of violence in most u s cities looked like this there was clustering and then we looked at the maps and the maps showed this typical wave upon wave upon wave because all epidemics are combinations of many epidemics and it also looked like which also sounds like if there is a case of flu someone gave someone a case of flu or a cold or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis is having been exposed to tuberculosis behaving like a contagious disease 're aware of this anyway even in our common experiences or our newspaper stories of the spread of violence and the first of it is interrupting and there 's special workers for doing that for this particular problem we designed a new category of in this case it 's someone who 's very angry because someone looked at his girlfriend or owes him money and you can find workers and train them into these specialized and the second thing to do of course is to prevent further spread that means to find who else has been exposed but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of t b or someone who is just hanging and that combination of factors is how the aids and so what we decided to do in the year two thousand is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers the first being violence interruptors and then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the united states at the time so violence interruptors hired from the same group but designed for a different category and trained in persuasion cooling people the outreach workers to keep people in a way on therapy for six to now our first experiment of this resulted in a 67 percent drop in shootings and killings in the west garfield neighborhood of chicago and this was then ninety days the funders said wait a second do it again get the funds to repeat this experience and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a 45 percent drop in shootings and killings and since that time this has been replicated twenty times there have been independent evaluations supported by the justice department and by the cdc and performed by johns hopkins that have shown in fact there have been three independent evaluations of this now now we 've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this including being featured on the new york times the economist in two thousand and nine said this is the approach that will come to prominence and even a movie was made around our work [ the interrupters ] however not so fast in other words what do you mean health problem and there 's whole industries designed my business friends said you 're being criticized tremendously you must be doing something right additionally there was still this problem and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce hiv and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful the movement is clearly growing many of the major cities in the u s including new york city and baltimore and kansas city their health departments are running this now chicago and new orleans the health departments are having a very large role in this this is being embraced more by law enforcement than where there 's really been uptake even faster is in the international environment where where interruptions are just beginning in honduras and where there have been five hundred interruptions in iraq so violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease so the theory in a way is kind of being validated by the the institute of medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data including the neuroscience on how this problem is really so i think this is good news because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the middle ages which is where i feel this field has been it gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with and to allow there to be a new strategy a new set of methods a new set of workers and moving away from emotions is the most important part of the solution to science as a more important part of the solution so i didn 't mean to come up with this at all it was a matter of i wanted actually a break and we looked at maps we looked at graphs we asked some questions and"
