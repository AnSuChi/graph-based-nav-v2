  "transcript": "and in many of the places where it counts the most women are in fact taking control of everything and now for every two men who get a college degree three women will do the same bankers accountants so the global economy is becoming a place where women are more successful than men believe it or not and these economic changes are starting to rapidly affect our culture what our romantic comedies look like what our marriages look like what our dating lives look like and our new set of superheroes for a long time this is the image of american manhood that dominated tough rugged in control of his own environment a few years ago man was retired and replaced by this much less impressive specimen the phrase first born son is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that this statistic alone shocked me in american fertility clinics seventy five and in places where you wouldn 't think such as south korea india and china the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little and families are no longer strongly preferring first born sons certainly this is not the first time that we 've had great progress with women the ' 20s and the ' 60s also come to mind but the difference is that back then it was driven by a very passionate whereas this time it 's not about passion and it 's not about any kind of movement this is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in the 200 000 year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end believe it or not and that 's why i talk about the end of men now all you men out there this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes because the point is that this is happening to all of us and this is why i like to talk about this because if we don 't acknowledge it then the transition the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women and i remembered back to about ten years ago when i read a book by susan faludi called stiffed the betrayal of the american man in which she described how hard the recession had hit men and i started to think about whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession i realized that two things were different this time around the first was that these were no longer just temporary hits that the recession was giving men that this was reflecting a deeper but it was also about what was happening to women statistics women take up most managerial jobs this second set of headlines you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift and look at that last headline young women earning more than young men they were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future it was young single women who were the major purchasers of houses so here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them now i 've just laid out the picture for you but i still haven 't explained to you why this is happening and in a moment i 'm going to show you a graph and what you 'll see on this graph it begins in just before women start flooding the workforce and it brings us up to our current day and basically what you 'll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy now what does that mean it means that the economy is dividing into jobs and that the middle the middle skill jobs and the the middle earning jobs are starting to drop out of the economy this has been going on for forty years now but this process is affecting men very differently than it 's so what 's that about it looks like women got some power boost on a video game or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth control pills that lets them shoot up high and now we have a service economy and an information those two economies require very different skills and as it happens women have been much better at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been this new economy is pretty indifferent to size and strength which is what 's helped men along all these years the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills you basically need intelligence you need an ability to sit still and focus to communicate openly to you would be issuing orders from above you would be very hierarchical you would tell everyone below you what to do but that 's not what an ideal leader is like now if you read management books now a leader is somebody who can foster creativity who can get his get the employees see i still say his who can get the employees to talk to each other who can basically build teams and get them and then at the working class all the new jobs that are created are the kinds elder care and food preparation so those are all the jobs that are growing and those are jobs that women tend to do and here the story is fairly simple why this is a real mystery people have asked men why don 't they just go back to college to community college and they can 't seem to build the social boy crisis is this idea that very young boys for whatever reason are doing worse in school than very young girls and people have theories about that is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum and little girls are better at that than little boys or that we require kids to sit still too much and so boys initially feel like failures and some people say it 's because in 9th grade boys start start dropping out of school because i 'm writing a book about all 10 year old daughter noa to talk to you about why the boys in her class do worse they were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely hr certainly when i was in college i had certain expectations about my life that my husband and i would both work but these college girls had a completely different view of their future and then here 's my favorite quote from one of the girls men are the new ball and chain but that quote has kind of a sting to it and i think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don 't reverse themselves without a lot of pain the night after i talked to these college girls i also went to a men 's group in kansas and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy which i spoke to you about earlier they were men who had been contractors or they had and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support and the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age and what he did was he wrote down on the board and he said that 's her salary and then he wrote down $ twelve thousand so who 's the man now he asked them who 's the damn man she 's the man now and that 's part of the reason i like to talk about this because i think it can be pretty painful and we really have to work through it and the other reason it of urgent is because it 's not just happening in the u s it 's happening all over the world poor women are learning english faster than their male counterparts in order to staff the new call centers that are growing in india in china a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses small businesses faster than men and here 's my favorite example which is in south korea south korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about they basically enshrined the and sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child but over the ' and so what they did was they started to push women into the workforce now they 've been asking a question since one thousand nine hundred and eighty five how strongly do you prefer a first born son so you can see that these economic changes really do have a strong effect on our culture now because we haven 't fully processed this information it 's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways where you can see that the stereotypes are changing and so we have on the male side what one of my colleagues likes to call the omega males popping up who are the males who are romantically challenged losers who can 't find a job and they come up in lots of different forms so we have the perpetual adolescent and it 's not just for the young and so it feels like we have to move from this place where we 've got these so for a long time in the economic sphere we 've lived with the term glass ceiling now i 've never really liked this term for one thing it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another because the men are these devious tricksters what crazy person would pop their head through a glass ceiling so is the high bridge but the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it"
