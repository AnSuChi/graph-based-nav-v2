  "transcript": "when i saw a piece of technology called kinect it was called natal maybe it 's possible to address that one problem to create a character which seemed alive which noticed me that could look me in the eyes and so i showed this off at a computer show called and there was a huge row online about hey this can 't be real and so i waited till now to have an actual demo of the real tech now this tech some incredible ai that was hidden in the dusty vaults collecting dust in microsoft plus our quite crude attempts at ai at a company called lionhead mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea to create living being in a computer so why don 't we go over and have a look at the demo now this is dimitri dimitri just waggle your arm around now you notice he 's sitting there are no controllers no keyboards you 're going to meet milo for the first time we had to give him a problem because when we first created milo we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat to be honest with you he was quite a know it all and he wanted to kind of make you laugh he 's moved from london to new england over in america his parents are too busy so here he is walking through and you 're able to interact with his world the cool thing is what we 're doing is we 're changing the mind of milo constantly so he 's discovering the garden you 're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails it 's snails if you 're a girl it 's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails so remember this is the first time you 've met him and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious by the way is fully ai driven we have complete control over his blush responses the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress he will try and slightly change the neuro linguistic nature of his of his face because we went out with this strong idea how can we make you believe that something 's real now we 've used the hand the other thing to use is your body why not just instead of you can lean back but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way so dimitri 's now going to use he 's used his hand he 's used his body he 's now going to use the other thing which is essential and that 's his voice now our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful isn 't it it never works you order an airline ticket you end up in timbuktu so we 've tackled even this choice will affect how milo develops do you want milo to squash it when you see the microphone we 've got a database of words which we recognize we pick those words out we also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of of dimitri 's voice or the user 's voice what we can do is we can look at the body very very interesting that that men more than women tend to be more competitive here where women they 're more nurturing about this how do you skim and you skim the stone it 's that simple understanding that you 've gone from sitting down to standing up again all of this is done in the way us humans do things and that 's crucially important if we want milo to appear real see if you to do any better milo 's being called back in by his parents giving us time to be alone and to help him out basically the bit that we missed at the start his parents had asked him to clean up his room and we 're going to help him with this now but this is going to be an introduction and this is all about the deep psychology that we 're trying to use we 're trying to introduce you you being able to talk in your natural voice to milo now to do that we needed a set up like a magician we did was we needed to give milo this big problem just spilled a plate of sausages on the floor on the brand new carpet we 've all done it as parents we 've all done it as children now 's a chance for dimitri to kind of reassure and calm milo down it 's all been too much for him he 's just moved house he 's got no friends now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to milo female voice why don 't you try saying something encouraging to cheer milo up dimitri come on milo you know what parents are like they 're always getting stressed milo we don 't know you 've got a new school to go to you 're going to meet loads of cool new friends milo i just really miss my old house that 's all dimitri well this is a pretty awesome house milo you 've got a cool garden to play in and a pond he recognizes you and i promise you if you 're sitting in front of this screen that is a truly wonderful moment and he has you know many adventures some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging he 's got to go to school as you interact with him you 're able to put things into his world he recognizes objects his mind is based in a cloud that means milo 's mind where i am no longer restrained by the finger i hold in my hand as far as a computer game 's concerned or by the blandness of not being noticed if you 're watching a film thank you very much"
