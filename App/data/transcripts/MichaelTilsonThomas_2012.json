  "transcript": "well when i was asked to do this tedtalk i was really chuckled because you see my father 's name was ted and much of my life especially my musical life is really a talk that i 'm still having with him or the part of me that he continues to be ted was a new yorker an all around theater guy and he was a self taught illustrator yet he was my greatest teacher because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids his understanding of music was profound and for him it wasn 't so much music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you and he did a painting of this experience which he called in the realm of music now ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of tin pan alley style what and the thing about classical music that what and how it 's inexhaustible that was his passion for the music both my parents really loved it they didn 't know all that much about it but and i think inspired it 's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can sort of pass it on through whatever means really fascinates me one day in new york i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and and he took a swing and really connected and he watched the ball fly for a second and then he went austrian aristocratic entertainment well when it comes to classical music there 's an awful lot to pass on much more than mozart beethoven or tchiakovsky because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over one thousand years and every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it 's like to be alive now the raw material of it of course is just the music of everyday life it 's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down to condense them to their absolute essence and from that essence create a new language a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are it 's a language that 's still evolving now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of like concertos and symphonies but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment like this one from the beethoven violin concerto so many emotions it 's just a design of pitches and silence and time and the pitches the notes as you know are just vibrations they 're locations in the spectrum of sound and whether we call them four hundred and forty per second a or three thousand seven hundred and b flat trust me that 's right but the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries as have our preferences for them so for example people was more like this century ears are quite happy with this last chord even though whether you knew it or not of changes practice and fashion and in classical music we can follow these changes very very accurately because now the impulse to notate or more exactly i should say encode music has been with us for a very long time in two hundred b c a man named sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the greeks a thousand years later this impulse to notate took an entirely different form and you can see how this happened in these excerpts little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune 12th century a line was drawn like a musical horizon line to better more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly and that led to the kind of notation we have today notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much instinct and intelligence and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move but a composer is considering testing them out prioritizing them out until he sees how they can now some of the greatest composers like bach were combinations of these two things bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master mozart was the same way and every musical era had different priorities of these things different things to pass on different ' whats ' and ' hows ' so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition and by the music was being written that tried to mirror god 's mind as could be seen in the design of the night was a style called polyphony music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in ptolemy 's geocentric universe this was truly the music of the kind of music that would have known and perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen a radical new move which in one thousand six hundred is what did happen the what now was not to mirror the mind of god but to follow the emotion turbulence of man and the how was harmony and the basic chords were the ones we still have with us the triads either the which we think is happy or the minor one which we perceive as sad but what 's the actual difference between these two chords it 's just these two notes in the middle it 's either e natural and or e flat the big difference between human happiness and sadness and in fact as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature harmony grew more complex to reflect it turns out it was capable of expressing now with all this possibility classical music really took off it 's the time in which the big forms began to arise and the because the scores the codebooks of music into the hands of performers everywhere and new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible this is when those big forms arose the symphonies the sonatas the concertos and in these big architectures of time composers like beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime a piece like beethoven 's fifth over the course of a half an hour step by exacting step of his route to the moment when he could make it and it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues like gripping ones of culture such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of but whatever direction the music took one thing until recently was always the same and that was when the musicians stopped playing the music stopped where does it go what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude and how might it 's the part of it and to me that 's the most essential of all mostly it 's been a person to person thing a thing and then around one thousand eight hundred and eighty came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally albeit an impersonal and technology democratized music by making everything available using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences at the same time technology by taking over the role that notation had always played shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side the culture in which we live now the question remains what happens when the music stops what sticks with people what does stick with us well let me show you a story of what i mean by really sticking and he balanced himself and began playing something like this music and he said something like how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed across the room well that 's why i take every performance so seriously why it matters to me so much but now i 'm excited that there 's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music that 's what drives my interest in projects like the tv series keeping score with the san francisco symphony that looks at the backstories of music and working with the young musicians at the new world symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education and of course the new youtube symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world and the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype there 's just a role here for so many people teachers parents performers to be explorers together sure the big events attract a lot of attention but what really matters is what goes on every single day we need your perspectives curiosity your voices and it excites me now to meet taxi drivers people i never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on you don 't need to worry about knowing anything if you 're alive you know all that you need to know you can start anywhere ramble a bit follow traces get lost be surprised amused inspired all that ' what ' all that ' how ' is out there waiting for you to discover its ' why ' thank you"
