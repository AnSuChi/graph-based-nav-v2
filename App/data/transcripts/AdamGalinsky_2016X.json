  "transcript": "speaking up i understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago when my wife and i became new parents it was an amazing moment it was exhilarating and elating but it was also scary and terrifying and it got particularly terrifying and we wanted to call but we also didn 't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy neurotic when we got to the doctor 's office the next day she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated our son is fine now and our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her but i didn 't but sometimes we speak up when we shouldn 't and i learned that over ten years ago when i let my twin brother down my twin brother and for one of his first films he got an offer from a distribution company and i helped him craft the perfect one and it was perfect and i 've asked people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up when they can assert themselves when they can push their interests when they can express an opinion and but they also make up a universal tapestry can i correct my boss when they make a mistake can i confront my coworker who keeps stepping on my toes can i challenge my friend 's insensitive joke can i tell the person i love the most sometimes we 're too strong we push ourselves too much 's what happened with my brother even making i we get punished in a variety of ways we get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized or we lose that raise or that promotion but the key thing is our range isn 't fixed it expands your power determines your range they had power sometimes it 's being new to a country like an immigrant or new to sometimes it 's at work where someone 's the boss and someone 's the subordinate sometimes it 's in relationships where one person 's more invested than the other person we have very little leeway the problem is now many of you have heard the phrase the double bind and connected it with one thing and that 's gender the gender double bind is women who don 't speak up go unnoticed but they have barriers to doing so but what my research has shown over the last two decades is is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind and what looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise and think biological cause there 's something fundamentally different about the sexes but in study after study i 've found that a better explanation for many sex differences and so it 's the lack power we have a narrow range and our double bind is very large when i i feel powerful when other people see me as powerful so we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior and i 'm going to give you a set of tools today but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up the first tool i 'm going to give you got discovered in negotiations in an important finding on average women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table but hannah riley bowles and emily amanatullah have discovered there 's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious that 's when they this is sometimes called the mama bear effect but sometimes we have to advocate for ourselves how do we do that one of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective taking and is really simple it 's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person but here 's the problem i want you all to hold your hand just like this your finger put it up it turns out that we can draw this e in one of two this was originally designed as a test of perspective taking i 'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an e on their forehead my former student erika hall perspective taking e because it looks like an e from someone else 's vantage point but this e over here and he says give me $ two thousand or i 'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb and she noticed something really important so she said why did you ask for $ two thousand and he said my friend is going to be evicted unless i get him $ two thousand immediately and she said oh you don 't want to rob the bank you want to take out a loan someone 's perspective it allows us to be ambitious and assertive but still be likable and that is to signal flexibility and you want to sell someone a car you 're going to more likely make the sale if you give them it lowers their defenses and they 're more likely to accept your offer but then my sister in law had a brilliant idea and it worked brilliantly she got dressed quickly and without resistance when the number one answer is when i have social support in my so we want to get allies on our side how do we do that well but we also earn strong allies when we ask others for advice and that 's the but if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable and this is so powerful it even works when you see it coming there have been multiple times in life when i have been forewarned that a low power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice i want you to notice three things about this first i knew they were going to come ask me for advice two 've actually done research on the another time we feel more confident speaking up we already have credibility we only need good evidence we need excellent evidence i want everyone in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them i want you to describe a passion of yours to me i 've had people do this all over the world and i asked them what did you notice about the other person when they described their passion and the answers are always the same their eyes lit up and got big they smiled a big beaming smile they used their hands all over i had to duck because their hands were coming at me as you listened to their passion i smiled i leaned in but we also get the permission from others to speak up both men and women get punished at work when they shed tears the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women i want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother 's wedding and so he wrote a speech for my brother 's wedding the better you become at improving and enriching your performance those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow change and your days will be mostly joyful those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and so when a scene calls for it be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker have excellent evidence and strong and if you use those tools and each and every one of you can use these tools thank you"
