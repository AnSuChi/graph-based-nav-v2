  "transcript": "i want to talk with you about is really the problem of how does one supply health care how do you do that and the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you i want to suggest to you is that 's diagnostics and then you have to do something let me just give you two examples the rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world poor resources a rigorous environment a so the technology i want to talk about is for the third world for the developing world the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing a table in a market what is our approach how you do that you 're not going to start with a $ one hundred thousand instrument and bring it down to no cost it isn 't going to work and what we 've chosen is paper what you see here is a prototypic device it 's about a centimeter on the side it 's about the size of a the lines around the edges are a polymer it 's made of paper and and the wine wicks all over everything put it on your shirt it ruins the shirt that 's what a hydrophilic surface does so in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a and the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want so this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper now how simple can you make the production why do we choose paper there 's an example of the same thing on a finger showing you basically what it looks like one reason for using paper is that it 's everywhere we have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps and all kinds of stuff 'll show you in a moment and then finally a point you don 't think of so much in developed world medicine and what sharps means is needles things that stick if you 've taken a sample of someone 's blood you don 't want to make a mistake and stick it in so it 's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things now you say if paper is a good idea and the most common of these is in a device that looks like thing on the left it 's something called a lateral flow immunoassay either containing a hormone called hcg does or does not flow across a piece of paper and if the second bar shows up you 're pregnant this is a terrific so it works very well there but it doesn 't work very well when you need more quantitative information so the approach the wax printer does what looks like printing you put that on you warm it a little bit the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper and you end up with the device you want the printers cost eight hundred bucks now that particular problem is solved and there is an example of the kind of thing that you see that 's on a piece of eight by twelve that takes about two seconds to make and so i regard that as done which is that because it 's a printer a color printer it prints colors that 's what color printers do i 'll show you in a moment that 's actually quite useful and the thing you 'd most like to analyze we 're a fair distance from it 's what 's called fever of what do they have do they have tb do they have aids do they have a common cold but then there are a series of things aids now even that 's more complicated than you think a friend of mine works in so dapsone or something like that you have to take for a while he has a wonderful story of talking to a villager what the guy actually meant was that he 'd fed a 30 day dose of dapsone to his dog that morning and he because in a different culture the dog is a surrogate for you today this month since the rainy season there are lots of and so an issue here is to in some cases figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting like compliance take a look at what a typical test looks like you get some blood about fifty microliters that 's about all you 're going to get because you can 't use the usual sort of so you take the drop of blood no further manipulations you put it on a little device the device filters out the blood cells lets the serum go through and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there and the colors indicate and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there and at this point there is a dramatic flourish and out comes the universal solution to everything these days which is a cell phone in this particular case a camera phone they 're everywhere six billion a month in india and the idea is that what one does is to you send out somebody who can just take the sample and in the clinic either a doctor or ideally a computer in this case does the particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work and and these are the things that get him through his day and that is that what one wants to do is pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system how do you get back an accurate view of the color on mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with also a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer this is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped i don 't know whether the idea of one computer one child makes any sense computer of the future because this screen is already there and they 're ubiquitous all right let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices and we 'll start by posing a little problem and you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting which is the yellow seems to disappear get through the blue and then get through the red how does that happen how do you make something flow through something and of course the answer is you don 't you make it flow under and over but now the question is how do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper the answer is that what you do and the details are not terribly important here is to make something more elaborate you take several different layers of paper and what you see at the lower and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that but that is in principle the way you solve the fever of and this will work in due course here is an example of a slightly more complicated device it distributes itself out into these various wells or holes and turns color all done with paper and carpet tape as we 're likely to be able to come up and make things now i have two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business and the question was here we do it by taking a sample we put it in a and we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way in fact you do it is what 's shown here you get an eggbeater and we sat down we did the physics of eggbeaters and tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing and sent it off to a journal we were very proud of this particularly the title which was eggbeater as centrifuge and we sent it off and by return mail it came back i called up the editor and i said what 's going on how is this possible the editor said and we 're not going to publish it because we only publish science laughter and it 's an important issue because it means that we have to as a society think about what we value and if it 's just papers and phys rev letters we 've got a problem here is another example of something which is it measures the absorption the neat thing about this is you have a light source that flickers on and off at about one thousand hertz and so you can run this system in broad daylight it performs about equivalently to a system that 's on the order of why doesn 't somebody do it the answer is how do you make a profit in a capitalist system so let me finish by saying that we 've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem and we 've decided we should think about this not so much in terms of cost but in terms of simplicity simplicity is a neat word you 've got to think about what simplicity means i know what it is but i don 't actually know what it means so i actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people the most recent involved a couple of people at mit one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people i would think of who 's an authentic genius we all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity and i want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought"
