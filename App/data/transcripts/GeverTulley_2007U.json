  "transcript": "five dangerous things you should let your children do i don 't have children i borrow my friends ' children so i 'm gever tulley i 'm a contract computer scientist by trade but i 'm the founder of something called the tinkering school it 's a summer program which aims to help kids learn how to build the things that they think of so we build a lot of things and i do put power tools into the hands of we live in a world that 's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations there doesn 't seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get we put suffocation every piece of plastic film manufactured in the united states or for sale with an item in the united states and we seem to think that any so where does this trend stop when we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object every pokey bit in the world then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp or not made out of round plastic they 'll hurt themselves with it so as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world and despite all of our best efforts and intentions kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can in whatever environment they can so despite the provocative title this presentation is really about safety some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be and what i now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress the learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child 's it 's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things these mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it so playing with this is like one of the great things we ever discovered fire they learn some basic principles about fire about intake combustion exhaust these are the three working elements of fire that you have to have for a good and you can think of the open pit fire as a laboratory you don 't know what they 're going to learn from playing with it let them fool around with it on their own terms and they 're going to learn things that you can 't get out of playing with dora the explorer toys which i think is a terrible thing and it 's a powerful and empowering tool and in a lot of cultures they give knives like as soon as they 're toddlers they have knives are inuit children cutting whale blubber and it left a lasting impression to see babies playing with knives and it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age you lay down a couple of very simple rules never force it and these are things kids can understand and practice with and yeah they 're going to cut i have some terrible scars on my legs from where i stabbed myself but you know they 're young they heal fast it turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things and like muscles if you don 't use parts of your brain they tend to atrophy over time but when when you exercise them any given muscle adds strength to the whole system and that applies to your brain too so practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes which have to do with visual acuity helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability and throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill so it 's very good for that kind of there is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that and that means that eventually they can understand all of them it 's a sense of knowability that something is knowable so these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people and you can understand them number five two parter break the digital millennium copyright act laughter there are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own in this case digital media it 's a very simple exercise buy a song on itunes write it to a technically the riaa could come and prosecute you it 's an important lesson for kids to understand that some of these laws get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpreted that 's something we often talk about with the kids when we 're fooling around with things and breaking them open and taking them apart and using them for other things and driving a car is is a really empowering act for a young child so this is the alternate for those of you who aren 't comfortable actually breaking the law can drive a car with your child this happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs these big things in the outside world that they 're trying to get a grip on a car is a similar object and they can get in a car and drive it gives them a handle on a world in a way that they don 't often have access to and it 's perfectly legal find a big empty lot make sure there 's nothing in it and that and it 's fun for the whole family"
