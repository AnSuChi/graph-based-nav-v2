  "transcript": "i 've got apparently eighteen minutes to convince you that history has a direction an arrow that in some fundamental sense it 's good that the arrow points to something positive when the ted before the avian flu had reached europe it was before hamas had won the palestinian election eliciting various counter measures by israel and to be honest if i had known when i was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as i was giving the upbeat talk but i didn 't ok so we 're here i 'll do what i can i 'll do what i can i 've got to warn you the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle sometimes even elusive the sense in which i can be uplifting and inspiring i mean a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way i i try to uplift so if grim inspiration today that 's that 's if i succeed i 'll see what i can do ok in one sense the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial if you 're just talking about social structure ok clearly that 's gotten more complex a little over the last ten thousand years has reached higher and higher levels that biological evolution was doing for us because what happened in the beginning this stuff encases itself in a cell then cells start hanging out together in societies eventually they get so close they form multicellular organisms but then at some point one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution cultural evolution and amazingly that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity evolution we mean the evolution of ideas a lot of you have heard the term memes the evolution of technology i pay a lot of attention to so you know one of the first things you got was a little hand axe generations go by somebody says hey why don 't we put it on a stick next best thing to a video game this may not seem to impress but technological evolution is progressive so another another ten twenty thousand years and armaments technology takes you here laughter impressive and the rate of of technological evolution evolution speeds up so a mere quarter of a century after this you get this ok and this i 'm sorry it was a cheap laugh but i wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse and i thought so what now first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are to be on the brink of true global originally you had the most complex societies the hunter gatherer village stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom which is what you get with the invention of agriculture multi village polity with centralized rule i kind of like that because it makes it look like a one celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic and then you get to you know you get empires social organization can transcend political bounds this is the silk road connecting the chinese empire and the roman empire so you had social complexity spanning the whole continent even if no polity did similarly today you 've got nation states point is there 's and i 'm just putting it up because i think it 's pretty does kind of convey the sense that i explained this growth of complexity by reference the key idea is the distinction between zero sum games in which correlations are inverse always a winner and a loser non zero sum games in which correlations usually it 's win lose it always if you 're playing doubles the person on your side of the net they 're in the same boat as you so you 're playing a non zero sum game with them it 's either for the better or for the worse ok a lot of forms of behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life but then through technological evolution new forms of technology arise arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of games involving more people you know and you get all the non zero sum games you don 't think about that are being played across the world like have you ever thought when you buy a car how many people on how many different continents contributed to the the manufacture of that car those are people in effect you 're playing a non zero sum game with i mean there are certainly that 's good well that actually it 's not intrinsically upbeat first of all it can accommodate it doesn 't deny the the existence of of inequality exploitation war but there 's a more fundamental reason that it 's not intrinsically upbeat because a non zero sum game all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse it doesn 't necessarily predict a win win outcome the question is on what grounds am i upbeat at all about history and the answer is first of all on balance i would say people have played their games to more win win outcomes than lose lose outcomes on balance i think history is a net positive in the non zero sum game department most amazes me most impresses me and most uplifts me which is that there is a moral dimension to history there is a moral arrow we have seen moral progress over time two thousand five hundred years ago members of one greek city state considered members of another greek city state subhuman and then this this moral revolution arrived and they decided that actually but this was progress you know give them credit and now today we 've seen more progress i think i hope most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings deserve to be treated decently and i attribute it to this i think that 's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities ethnicities religions as there is today and i think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that i kind of think this is but i assume that in business class you don 't hear many expressions of you know bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups because the people who are flying trans atlantic business class are doing business with all these people they 're making money off all these people and i i really do think that in that sense at least capitalism has been a constructive force and more fundamentally it 's a non zero sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people 's realm of moral awareness which is the fundamental equality of everyone it has done that as it has moved global i think that 's wonderful first of all if you look at the relationship between the so called muslim world and western world two terms i don 't like but can 't really avoid in such a short span of time they 're efficient if nothing else it and by that i mean if people in the muslim world get more hateful more resentful less happy with their place in the world it 'll be bad for the west if they get more happy it 'll be good for the west so that and i would say the non zero sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends but more intense in a kind of negative way it 's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible and one reason is because of something i call the growing lethality of hatred more and more it 's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized and i think it 's probably going to get a lot worse trends in information technology in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and and there 's something i worry about especially which is that that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope i have in mind is terrorism happens here we overreact to it but i think in something we really shouldn 't have the word positive there at all even in a technical sense so let 's call it the death spiral of negativity i assure you if it happens at the end both the west and the muslim world first of all we can do a lot more with arms control the international regulation of dangerous technologies i have a whole global governance sermon that i will spare you right i think we 're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world i think you 're just going to have to see less hatred among groups less bigotry i 've got to admit i feel silly saying that it sounds so kind of pollyannaish i feel like rodney king you know saying why can 't we all just get i don 't really see any alternative given the way i read the situation there 's going to have to be moral progress there 's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world it 's ultimately grounded in cynicism of morality is that it boils down to self interest it 's when people 's fortunes are correlated it 's when your welfare conduces to mine that i decide oh yeah i 'm all in favor of your welfare that 's what 's responsible for this growth of we will see the development of tolerance and so on the norms that we need you know we will see the further evolution of this kind of morality so these two things you know if they get people 's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what 's in their self interests which is further the moral evolution then they could actually have a constructive i lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric reasons to be cheerful i never called myself mr uplift i 'm just launching a moral and i think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things we all start where we are i think that 's a because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something somebody you 're kind of viewing who 's doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange to really understand and i think that is an expansion of your of your moral compass when you manage to do that it 's especially hard to do when people hate you because you don 't really in a sense want to i can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country i live in that 's not a pleasant thing but i think it 's something that we 're going to have to the root causes of things i want to understand it the reason you 're trying to understand why they hate us is to get them to quit hating us the idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run i think it 's the first step toward that that 's the long term goal there are people who worry about this and in fact i myself apparently was denounced on national tv a couple of nights ago because of an op ed i 'd written it was kind of along these lines if you 've got to have an enemy do make it ann coulter because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love and so on but i think we lot closer to erring so i 'm not really worried about it will have forced us to a higher moral level and a kind of saving higher moral level something that kind of literally saves the world if you look at the word salvation in the bible the christian usage that we 're familiar with saving souls that people go to heaven that 's actually a latecomer the original meaning of the word salvation in the bible is about saving the social system yahweh is our savior means he has saved the nation of israel which at the time was a pretty high level social organization"
