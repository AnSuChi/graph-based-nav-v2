  "transcript": "the honorary perpetual secretary of l 'academie francaise the french academy he is splendidly attired in his the correct usage in french and perpetuating the language it compiles a dictionary of official french they 're now working on their ninth edition which they began in one thousand nine hundred and thirty and they 've reached the letter p they also legislate on correct usage such as the proper term for what the french call email which ought to be courriel the world wide web the french are told ought to be referred to as now this is one model of how language comes to be it 's legislated by an academy but anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a and this is visible in the unstoppable change in language the fact that by the time the academy finishes their dictionary it will already be well out of date we see it in the constant so language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature so much as a window onto human nature in a book that i 'm currently working on i hope to use language to shed light on a human nature including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types that govern human interaction and i 'm going to say a few words about each one this morning let me start off with a technical problem in language that i 've worried about for quite some time and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they 're used the problem is the verb is the chassis of the sentence it 's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted let me give you a a quick reminder of something that you 've long forgotten an intransitive verb such as dine for example can 't take a direct object you have to say sam dined not sam dined the pizza a transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there sam devoured the pizza you can 't just say sam dozens or scores of verbs of this type each of which shapes its sentence so a problem in explaining how children learn language a problem in the dative construction in english you can say give a muffin to a so a tempting generalization for a child for an adult for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction can also be expressed as handy thing to have because language you can 't just parrot back the sentences that you 've heard you 've got to extract generalizations so you can produce and understand new sentences this would be an example of how to do that unfortunately there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions you can say biff drove the car to chicago but not biff drove chicago the car you can say sal gave jason a headache but it 's a bit odd to say sal gave a headache the solution is that these constructions despite initial appearance are not synonymous that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition you see that there 's a subtle difference in meaning between them so give the x to the y many events can be subject to either construal kind of like the classic figure ground reversal illusions in which you can either pay attention to the particular object in which case the space around it recedes from attention or you can see the faces in the empty space in which case the object recedes out of consciousness how are these construals reflected in language well in both cases the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object the noun after the verb so when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere where you 're doing something to the muffin you say give the muffin to the mouse when you construe it as cause the mouse to have something and therefore you express it as give the mouse the muffin the problem with which i began depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change to give something involves both causing something to go and causing someone to have to drive the car only causes something to go because chicago 's not the kind of thing that can possess something only humans can possess things you may just be loud or obnoxious or some other way causing them to have the headache so that 's so why should anyone care well there are a number of interesting conclusions i think from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of english verbs there 's a level of fine grained conceptual structure which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence that governs our use of language you can think of this as the language of thought or mentalese it seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs not only in english but in all other languages fundamental concepts such as causation and human intention such as what is the means and what is the ends these are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that immanuel kant and it 's interesting that our unconscious use of language seems to reflect these kantian categories doesn 't care about perceptual qualities such as color texture weight and speed which virtually never differentiate differentiate the use of verbs in different constructions an additional twist is that all of the constructions in english are used not only literally but in a for example this construction the dative is used not only to transfer things but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas as when we say she told a story to me or told me a story max taught spanish to the students or taught the students spanish exactly the same construction but no muffins no mice nothing moving at all it evokes the container metaphor of communication in which we conceive of ideas as objects sentences as containers and communication as a kind of sending as when we say we gather our ideas to put them into words and if our words aren 't empty or hollow we might get these ideas across to a listener who can unpack our words to extract their you can use the verb go and the prepositions to and from in a literal spatial sense the messenger went from paris to istanbul you can also say biff went from sick to well he needn 't go anywhere he could have been in bed the whole time but it 's as if his health is a point in state space that you conceptualize as moving or meeting went from three to four in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line likewise we use force to indicate not only physical force as in rose forced the door to open but also interpersonal force as in rose forced sadie to go not necessarily by manhandling her but by issuing a threat or rose forced herself to go as if there were two entities inside rose 's head engaged in a tug of war such as cause something to go to someone and causing someone to have something i think is a fundamental feature of human thought and it 's the basis for much human argumentation in which people don 't differ so much i think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a causation and intention which are useful in a social knowledge intensive species whose evolution you can well imagine and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content space time and force and apply them to new abstract domains therefore allowing a law and other abstract domains well i said i 'd talk about two windows on human nature the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world and now i 'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction again as reflected in language and i 'll start out with a puzzle the puzzle of indirect speech acts now i 'm sure most of you have seen the movie fargo and you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer is asked to show his driver 's license and holds his wallet out with a 50 dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet and he says i was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it including the audience interprets for example that would be awesome we know exactly what he means even though that 's a rather bizarre concept being expressed would you like to come up and see my etchings i think most people if someone says nice store you 've got there it would be a real shame if something happened to it we understand that as a veiled threat rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities so the puzzle is why are bribes polite requests solicitations and threats so often veiled no one 's fooled both parties know exactly what the speaker means and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows etc etc so what 's going on i think the key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships and human relationships fall into a number of types there 's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist alan fiske in which relationships can be categorized more or less into communality which works on the principle what 's mine is thine what 's thine is mine the kind of dominance whose principle is don 't mess with me reciprocity you scratch my back i 'll scratch yours and sexuality in the immortal words of cole porter let 's do it even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied for example communality applies most naturally within family or friends but it can be used to try to transfer the the family of man you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin ' plate that would be rather awkward as well in less blatant cases there 's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on or refer to him or her on a first name basis if two friends have a reciprocal transaction like selling it 's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness in dating the transition from friendship to sex can lead to notoriously various forms of awkwardness and as can sex in the workplace in which we call the conflict between as a social interaction has to satisfy two conditions you have to convey the actual content here we get back to the container metaphor you want to express the bribe the command the promise the whereas the implicated content the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context which possibly initiates a changed relationship the simplest example of this is in the polite request if you express your request as a conditional if you could open the window that would be great even though the content is an imperative the fact that you 're not using the imperative voice means that you 're not acting as if you 're in a relationship of dominance you could presuppose the compliance of the other person on the other hand you want the damn guacamole by expressing it as an if then statement you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around and in a more subtle way i think this works for all of the veiled speech acts involving plausible deniability the bribes threats propositions solicitations and so on one way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language where it could only be used literally and you can think of it in terms of a game theoretic payoff matrix put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer there 's a high stakes in if you don 't bribe the officer then nothing ventured nothing gained in that case the consequences are rather if the officer is honest you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe in which case you get the payoff of going free the honest officer can 't hold you to it as being a bribe and therefore you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket so you get and a similar analysis i think can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solicitation and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset i think this affirms something that 's long been known by diplomats namely that the vagueness of language far from being a bug or an imperfection actually might be a feature of language one that we use to our advantage in social interactions how we relate to one another and then by analyzing i think we can get a window onto what makes us tick thank you very much"
