  "transcript": "i gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place this involved a journey into national and global advocacy in the process i became a civil society diplomat they voice the concerns of the people and if you want to but many people still ask can civil society really make a big difference can citizens influence and shape national and global policy but here i am to share some lessons about two powerful civil society movements that i 've been involved in they are in issues that i 'm passionate about gun control latin america is ground zero for both of them for example brazil this beautiful country hosting tedglobal has the world we are the number one champion in homicidal violence one in every ten people killed around the world is a brazilian this translates into over thousand people dying violently each year most of them are young black boys dying by guns brazil is also around fifty percent of the homicides in the streets in brazil the same is true for about twenty five percent of people in latin america has nine percent of the world 's population but percent of its global violent deaths these are not problems we can run away from i certainly could not but we collected and destroyed almost half a was one of the biggest buyback programs in history but we also the second initiative was also home grown but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime i am the executive coordinator of something called the taboo on drugs is broken across the americas from the us and mexico to colombia and uruguay change is in there are certainly many more but these are the ones that stand out to me but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative but that civil society groups generally do not do very well our biggest success has been to change the discussion away from prosecuting a war on drugs to putting people 's health and safety first in a cutting edge report we just launched in new york we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this $ three hundred and twenty billion so in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups we need to make illegal drugs i don 't mean drugs should be a free for all where different drugs would have different degrees of regulation and this brings me to my next lesson never we really our opponent used our own arguments against us the national rifle association they inundated our campaign with their propaganda that as you know links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom in fact guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign but i ask you right is more important the right to life or the right to have a gun that takes life away we thought people would but in a country with a recent past of military dictatorship the and we were not prepared to respond there are huge military police prisons and financial establishments our chair former brazilian president fernando henrique cardoso reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum from liberals to conservatives this high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies informed and strategic discussion that revealed the sad truth about the war on drugs the war on drugs has simply failed across every metric drugs are cheaper and more available than ever but we 've made a difference by anticipating the arguments of our opponents and by leveraging powerful voices that a few years ago would probably have resisted change use data to drive your argument but this doesn 't mean that we it was a local soap opera called women in love that kicked off brazil 's national gun control campaign brazilian grannies and housewives were outraged within weeks our national congress approved the disarmament bill that had been languishing for years we were then able to mobilize data to show the successful outcomes of the change in the law and gun collection program here is what i mean we could prove we saved more than five thousand lives drugs in order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue and people are starting to get it my fourth insight is don 't be afraid to bring together odd bedfellows what we 've learned in brazil and this doesn 't only apply to my country is the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together we brought together a wonderful mix of people we mobilized the elite and got huge we also assembled the professional classes doctors lawyers academia and more what i 've learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change they disagree on almost everything but the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view i was as far removed from the world of civil society diplomacy i helped to create social movements that i believe have made some parts of the world safer and no matter thank you"
