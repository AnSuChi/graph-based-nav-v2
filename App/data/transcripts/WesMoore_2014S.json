  "transcript": "i 'm excited to be here to speak about vets because i didn 't join the army because i wanted to go to war i didn 't join the army because i had a lust i joined the army because and i joined the army i didn 't come from a military family i 'm not a military brat no one in my family ever had joined the military at all and how i first got introduced to the military was when i was thirteen years old and i got sent because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since i was eight years old i had some issues when i was coming up and my mother would always tell me she 's like you know if you don 't get this together i 'm going to send you to military school and i 'd look at her and i 'd say mommy i 'll work harder and then when i was nine years old she started giving me brochures to show me she wasn 't playing around so i 'd look at the brochures and i 'm like okay mommy i can see you 're serious and i 'll my behavior just kept on getting worse i was on academic and disciplinary probation before i hit double digits and i first felt handcuffs on my wrists when i was eleven years old and so when i was thirteen years old my mother came up to me and she was like i 'm not going to do this anymore i 'm going i can see you 're upset and that was how i first got introduced to this whole idea of the military because she thought this was a good idea because literally in the first four days i had already run away five times from this school they had these big black gates that surrounded the school and every time they would turn their backs i would so i just said well if that 's the case then i 'd like to leave and i kept on getting lost i realized that i actually was growing up i realized the things that i enjoyed about this school and the thing that i enjoyed about the structure was something that i 'd never found before the fact that leadership wasn 't just a punchline there but that it was a real actually core part of the entire experience and so when it was time for me to actually finish up high school thinking about what i wanted to do i thought about a lot of the people in particular a lot of the men in my life so for me the question and the answer really became pretty so the army then went through this process and they trained me up i didn 't ever feel like i was in danger when i went to my mom i first joined the army when i was seventeen years old so i literally needed parental permission so i kind of gave the paperwork to my mom and she just assumed it was kind of like military school she was like well it was good for him before so i guess i 'll just let him keep doing it having no idea that the paperwork that she was signing was actually signing her son up and i went through the process and again the whole time still just thinking this is great maybe i 'll serve on a weekend or two weeks during the year and then a couple years after i signed up a couple years after my mother signed those papers the whole world changed there was an entirely new context about the occupation that i chose when i first joined i never joined to fight and i thought about so much about the soldiers who i eventually had to end up leading i remember when when we first right after nine eleven three weeks after nine eleven i was on a plane heading overseas but i wasn 't heading overseas with the military i was heading overseas because i got a scholarship to go overseas i received the scholarship to go overseas and and to go study and live overseas and i was living in england and that was interesting but at the same time the same people who i was training with the same soldiers that i went through all my training with and we prepared for war they were now actually heading over to it they were now about to find themselves in the middle of places the fact is the vast majority of people the vast majority of us as we were training couldn 't even point out on a map and i 'm sitting there talking to dons and how that influenced the start of the entire time my heart and my head were on my soldiers kevlars and grabbing their flak vests and figuring out how exactly do i change around or how exactly do i clean a machine gun in the darkness by the time i finished that up and i rejoined my military unit were getting ready to deploy to afghanistan there were soldiers in my unit who were now on their second and third deployments before i even had my first i remember walking out with my unit for the first time and when you join the army stared at it but you get a chance to talk to your soldiers and you ask them why did they sign up i signed up because college was expensive they signed up because of a sense of obligation they signed up because they were angry and they wanted to do something about it they signed up because their and now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts and what was amazing to me was that i very naively started hearing this statement that i never fully understood because right after nine eleven you start hearing this idea where people come up to you and they say well thank you for your service but i really had no idea what that even meant i just said it because it sounded right i said it because it sounded like the right thing to say to people who had served thank you for your service but i had no idea what the context was or what that even what it even meant to the people who heard it i thought that if you made it back from a conflict zone that somehow you could kind of wipe the sweat off your brow and say whew i 'm glad i dodged that the war keeps going it keeps playing out in all of our minds it plays out in all of our memories please forgive us if we don 't like being in big crowds forgive us when we spend one week because you 're not allowed to walk around with white lights because if anything has a white light it can be seen from miles away versus if you use little green or little blue lights they cannot be seen from far away so please forgive us if out of nowhere we go from having one hundred percent light discipline we have a difficult time adjusting to that please forgive us when you transition back to a family who has completely been maneuvering without you because the whole normal has the problem with that is then it feels like your service was not even acknowledged like no one even cared thank you for your service and we move on what i wanted to better understand isn 't enough the fact is we have literally two point six million men and women who are veterans of iraq or afghanistan who are all amongst us sometimes we know who they are sometimes we don 't but there is that feeling the shared experience the shared bond while it might be closed it 's still not over we think about thank you for your service and people say so what does ' thank you for your service ' mean to you well thank you for your service me it means acknowledging our stories asking us who we are understanding the strength that so many people so many people who we serve with have and why that service means so much thank you for your service means acknowledging the fact that just because we 've now come home and we 've taken off the uniform does not mean our larger service to this country is somehow over the fact is there 's still a tremendous amount that can be offered and can be given when i look at people like our friend taylor urruela who in iraq loses his leg had two big dreams in his life one was to be a soldier the other was to be a baseball player he loses his leg in iraq he comes back and instead of deciding that that well now since i 've lost my leg that second dream is over he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball and he starts this group called vetsports which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing people like tammy duckworth who was a helicopter pilot and with and she 's trying to steer the chopper but the chopper 's not reacting to her instructions and to her but the chopper doesn 't land safely and the reason it 's not landing safely is because it 's not responding to the commands that her legs are giving because her legs were blown off she barely survives she realizes that my job 's still not done and now she uses her voice as a congresswoman from illinois to fight and advocate for a collection of issues to include veterans issues we signed up because we love this country we represent we signed up because we believe in the idea and we believe in the people to our left and to our right needs to be more than just a quote break that thank you for your service means honestly digging in to the people who have stepped up simply because they were asked to and what that means for us not just now not just during combat operations but long after the last the last vehicle has left and after the last shot has been taken so thank you for your service"
