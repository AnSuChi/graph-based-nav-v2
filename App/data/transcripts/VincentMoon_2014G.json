  "transcript": "microphones as much as possible possible to use the internet to create a new form of cinema and actually why do we record well it is with such simple questions in mind that i started to make films ten years ago first abric he had a website la blogothque dedicated to independent music we were crazy about music we wanted to represent music in a different way to film the music we love the musicians we admired as much as possible far from the music industry and far from the cliches attached to it we started to publish we are going to see a few extracts now from phoenix playing by the eiffel tower from arcade fire in an elevator in the olympia to beirut going down from r e m in a car to the national around a table at night in the south of france from bon iver playing with some friends in an apartment in montmartre to many more and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way we wanted to create another type of intimacy using all those new at the time reaching after a while i got a bit to explore the world and actually it was also this idea of how could the use of new technologies and the road fit together how could i edit my films in a bus crossing the andes so i went on five year travels around the globe i started at the time in the digital film and music was also an homage to french filmmaker chris marker we 're going to see now a few more extracts of those new films from experimental electronic music in singapore with one man nation to from the bambir the great rock band from armenia to some traditional songs in a restaurant from white shoes a great retro pop band from jakarta indonesia to many i was traveling alone with a backpack which was absolutely not professional people on the spot there going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek i really believed that cinema could be i give you a moment of cinema had no idea about what i would do there thirty three films only with the help of local people only with the help of people that i was asking all the time the same question what is important to record here by living in such a way by working without any structure react to the moment the first person i met looked at me and was like i was there to research on sufi rituals in chechnya actually which is absolutely unknown outside of the region as soon as people understood that i would give them those films i would publish them online for free under a creative commons license would also really give them to the people and i would let them do what they want with it i just want to represent them in a beautiful light i just want to portray them in a way that their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather that 's the way people are going to look differently at their own culture at their own land they 're going to think about it differently it may be a way to maintain a certain diversity is a tombstone of a live performance it 's a really good sentence to keep in mind i was researching i was still what 's the point i had no idea my little tool to get closer and maybe not only capture the trance but find an equivalent a something in complete harmony with the people that is now my my new research i 'm doing on spirituality on new spirits around the world maybe a few more extracts now from the tana toraja funeral ritual in indonesia the sufi rituals of chechnya to a mass in the holiest church of armenia some sufi songs in harar the holy city of ethiopia to an ayahuasca ceremony deep in the amazon of peru with the shipibo then to my new project the one i 'm doing now here in brazil spiritualities all around the country this is my quest my own little quest of what i call experimental ethnography trying to regain a certain i really believe cinema teaches us to see the way we show the world is going to change the way we see this world and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible terrible job at representing the world to reinvent you show up in places like the ones you just have shown us and you are carrying a camera and i assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome you walk into sacred rituals private moments in a how do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens to trust the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain the respect is stepping forward not stepping backward and i really think that by engaging your body in the moment in the ceremony in the places people welcome you and understand your energy bg you told me that most of the videos you have made are actually one single shot otherwise you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning and so is that the case it 's correct vm my idea is that i think that as long as we don 't cut in a way as long going to to not cut all the time from one place to another to just let the time go bg tell me in a few words about your new project hbridos here in brazil just before coming to tedglobal you have actually been traveling around the country for that far from the cliches is the greatest religious country in the world the greatest country in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities and it 's a which is researching in very different in very different forms of cults and trying to understand how people live together with spirituality nowadays bg the man who is going to appear onstage is one of the subjects of one of his past when did you do a video with him vm i guess four years ago in my first travel bg so it was one of your first ones in brazil vm it was amongst the first ones in brazil who are we waiting for vm i 'll just make it very short it 's a very great honor for me to welcome onstage one of the greatest brazilian musicians of all time please welcome nan vasconcelos would was the the the correct i the in a way the the the"
