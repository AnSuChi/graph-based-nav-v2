  "transcript": "start by looking at some great photographs but the harvard lampoon lampoon is about to come out with a parody of national geographic and i shudder to think he mounted a camera on the tail a poetic image for a story on tolstoy by sam abell by randy olson i love this photograph because it reminds me of degas ' bronze sculptures of the little dancer a polar bear swimming in the arctic by these are camels moving across the rift valley in making her own special connection photographed this is a soap disco in spain photographed by david alan harvey and david said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor but these are sea lions and this is a comet captured by dr euan mason the bow of the titanic without movie stars photographed by emory kristof photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today 's saturated media world because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment here 's an example i was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty i can stand here right now and see as i go tearing into the water after the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement i can see his hands saying help me dad but this flashbulb memory as it 's called is when all but my emotional connection to it and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection now i have to tell you i was talking to kyle last week i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me i thought i was a hero laughter so this represents this is a cross sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world 's greatest photojournalists working at the very top of their craft except one and it was submitted and published in national geographic and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them but to be a but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story so i 'm going to share with you some coverages that i feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography photographer nick this is a serval cat he 's actually taking his own picture shot with what 's called a camera trap there 's an infrared beam that 's going across and he has stepped into the beam and taken his these are baboons at a watering hole nick the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons and a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward here 's a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography has made a big difference for it was with the elephants that this story along with researcher dr michael fay collared the matriarch of the herd they named her annie and that 's when they ran into trouble for outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks and they only came for the ivory this is actually one of the rangers they were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory because they couldn 't leave it there because it 's still valuable but what nick did was he brought back instead of just knowledge of this park he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants the rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflicts sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way we were looking at the same issue that richard wurman touches upon in his new world population project for the first time in history more people live but in the slums that surround them let 's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world and i said well you know that might be a bit ambitious for our budget so instead what we did was we decided to instead of going out and doing what would result in what we 'd consider sort of a survey story where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything which is part of mumbai india and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city what jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places by staying tightly focused in one place jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community sometimes though the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture we teamed up underwater photographer brian skerry and photojournalist randy olson to document the depletion of the world 's fisheries but the photographs that brian and randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing here in a photo by brian i 've seen sort of ok pictures of bycatch the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species but here brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard and brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the and here in china randy shot a jellyfish market and i think anytime we 're doing a we don 't really want to go and just look at all the problems we also want to look for solutions brian photographed a marine sanctuary in new zealand where commercial fishing had been banned at last year 's ted took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the american wounded coming out of iraq jim started in the battlefield here a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital here is in the field hospital the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed the more severely wounded are transported back to germany where they meet up with their families for the first time and then back to the states to recuperate often fitted with high tech prosthesis they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to photographer paul nicklin traveled to antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals they have been rarely photographed partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean in fact a year earlier a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed so you can imagine paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water now what leopard seals do mostly you know of the march of the penguins this is sort of the munch of the penguins here a penguin but then paul got in the water she 's probably it 's a shame you can 't see it in the photograph but she 's twelve feet long and paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how big i am or you know my what big teeth you have then paul thinks that she simply took pity on him to her here was this big goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn 't seem to be interested in chasing penguins until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head which just resulted in a fantastic photograph eventually though paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive this is her just puffing out you know snorting out lost interest with him and went back to what she does best"
