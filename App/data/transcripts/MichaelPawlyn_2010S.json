  "transcript": "a couple of quick examples and to make that it involves and yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water it does suggest we 've still got a bit to learn so these two examples if we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does shifting from a linear and for all three of these i believe biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we 're going to need you could look at nature as being like a catalog of products and all of those have benefited from a 3 8 billion year research and development period and given that level of investment it makes sense to use it so i 'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these and let 's start with radical increases in resource efficiency when we were working on the eden project so for instance it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons and in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on and what you do is you put it together in three layers you weld it around the edge and then you inflate it and it was only one percent of the weight of double glazing so that was a so with such large lightweight pillows we had much less steel with less steel we were getting more sunlight in and at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure so i think the eden project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency and actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar whole buildings inspired by abalone shells so now i want to go onto talking about the and there are some examples of projects that have deliberately to mimic ecosystems and one of my favorites is called the cardboard to caviar project by graham wiles and i 'm just going to talk through this so they were paid to collect it they then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding when that was soiled they were paid again to collect it which they sold back to the restaurants and it created more value in the process graham wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this turning waste streams into schemes that create value and just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time there 's a real sense with this project that and i know it 's a quirky example but i think the the implications of this are quite radical because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem waste into a massive we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas then we would have an anaerobic digester which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area turn heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid we 'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro organisms we 'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant so you can see that we 're bringing together we 've proposed this for a roundabout in central london which at the moment is a complete eyesore some of you may recognize this we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities and during the and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at to to halt or maybe even reverse desertification and if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity this is the namibian fog basking beetle and it 's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert the way it does this is it comes out at night crawls to the top of a sand dune because it 's got a matte black shell is able to radiate heat out to the night sky so when the moist breeze blows in off the sea you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle 's shell and those bumps are hydrophilic they attract water between them there 's a waxy finish which repels water and the effect of this so even when there 's only a small amount of moisture in the air it 's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth so amazing example of an adaptation to a very and in that sense very relevant to the kind of challenges we 're going to be facing over the next few years next few decades we and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills so inside it 's cool and humid which means the plants need less water to grow and then at the back of the greenhouse it condenses a lot of that so they just started spreading this on the land around and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area it looked like that so it was like a so we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits but actually in mature ecosystems just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships which uses solar tracking mirrors to focus the sun 's heat to create electricity and just to give you some sense of the potential of csp consider that we receive ten thousand times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all and the kind of synergies i 'm talking about are firstly both these csp produces a lot of waste heat we 'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits so this is how this scheme would look the idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind we and with biomimicry if you 've got an underutilized resource how am i going to dispose of this you think what can i add to the system to create more value and that builds up on the evaporators and that 's what that image on the left is and if you think about the carbon in that that would have come out of the atmosphere into the sea and then locked away in a building product the next thing is sodium chloride you can also compress that into a building block as they did here this is a hotel in bolivia and then after that there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract like phosphates that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them and there 's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater so it should be possible to extract valuable in parts of the the arabian gulf the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity so returning to those big challenges that i mentioned at the beginning radical increases in resource efficiency closing loops and a solar economy they 're not just possible they 're critical but perhaps more than anything what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design and this is an important point you need to set people 's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores and that 's what we need to do so let 's be positive and let 's make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we 've ever seen"
