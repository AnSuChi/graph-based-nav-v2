  "transcript": "the misguided belief by most economists central banks that we have transformed into a new world of this was seen by robust and steady gdp growth by low and controlled inflation by low unemployment and controlled and low financial volatility broke this illusion a few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector cascaded into five trillion dollars of losses in world gdp and almost $ great recession was that there was no responsibility so as a reflection of this we started the financial crisis observatory we had the goal to diagnose in real time financial bubbles and identify in advance their critical time we developed a theory called consider the financial price time series a given stock your perfect stock or a global index very good measure of the risk of this financial market is the peaks to valleys that represent a worst case scenario when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom you can look at the statistics the frequency of the occurrence of peak to valleys of different sizes which is represented in this graph now be represented by a universal power law represented by this there are exceptions than the extrapolation would predict them to they are due to trenchant dependancies such that a loss is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss these kinds of dependencies are largely missed by standard risk management tools which ignore them and see lizards should see dragon kings this is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube reaching the boiling point where the instability of the water occurs and you have the phase transition to vapor which is absolutely non linear cannot be predicted by standard techniques so the the cause of the crash the cause of the crisis has to be found in an inner instability of the system and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur some of you may have come to the mind that is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently remember black swan is this rare bird that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief that all swans should be white captured the idea of so let 's are many early warning signals that are predicted by this theory let me just focus on one of them the imagine you have an investment that returns the first year five percent the second year ten percent the third year twenty percent exponential growth corresponds to a constant growth rate let 's say of ten percent there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times such that increase the next growth and the key idea is that the mathematical solution of this class of models exhibit finite time singularities which means and the key idea is that the critical time and a collective phenomenon of positive feedback the more damage gives the more damage so you can actually predict epileptic seizures from seven months of pregnancy a mother starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus that are the sign of these maturations toward the instability giving birth to the baby the dragon king so if you measure the precursor epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size and when the brain goes to glacier collapse but perhaps the most important application is for finance and this theory illuminates i believe the deep reason for the financial crisis that we have gone through this is rooted the real estate bubbles in many countries financial derivative commodity and all bubbles this is a measure of global overvaluation expressing what i call an illusion of a perpetual money machine the problem is that we see in particular through quantitative easing of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays this has very important implications to understand the failure of quantitative easing as well as austerity measures as long as we don 't attack the why would you believe me well perhaps because in the last fifteen years and started to publish ex ante and i stress the term ex ante it means in advance before the crash confirmed these are a few of the major bubbles that we have lived through in recent history again many interesting stories for each of them let me tell you just one or two this is the expression of the stock market of a a factor of three three hundred percent in just a few years in september two thousand and seven i was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund management conference and i showed to the conference a prediction there might be a crash how do you believe the very smart very motivated very informed macro hedge fund managers but you forget the beijing olympic games coming in august two thousand and eight and it 's very clear that the chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market three weeks after my presentation the markets lost twenty percent and a total market loss of seventy percent until the end of the year so how can we be so collectively wrong by misreading or ignoring the science of the fact that when an instability has developed and the system is ripe any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control the chinese market but it rebounded we also identified that this new bubble a smaller one was unsustainable so the market will correct will not continue on this track said no it 's not possible the chinese government is there they have learned their lesson they want to benefit from the growth perhaps these critics have not learned their the market corrected the same critics then said ah yes but you published your prediction you influenced the market it was not a prediction this is interesting we identify excesses bubbles we write a report but with modern encrypting we release the report and there is authentication and all this is done on an international archive so that we cannot be let me tease you we identified that the u s stock market was on an unsustainable path the market started to change regime scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet we see the same thing wherever we we look it 's observable in the biosphere in the atmosphere in the ocean showing these trajectories characterizing an unsustainable path and announcing a phase transition this diagram on the right shows a very beautiful compilation of studies suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear possibility for a nonlinear as a professor who chases bubbles and slays dragons as the media has sometimes called we studied a dynamical system where you see the dragon king as these big loops and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times these dragons the case that this is probably one of the biggest gaps of mankind which has the responsibility to steer our societies and our planet toward sustainability in the face of growing we learn that most systems have pockets of predictability it is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises so we can take measures we can take responsibility and so that never again will extremes and crises like the great recession or the european thank you"
