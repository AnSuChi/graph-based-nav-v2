  "transcript": "as a culture we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future and where we might move forward from this point but i want to tell you a different story here today like all stories it has a beginning my work for a long time has been involved in education in teaching people practical skills for sustainability teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food how to build buildings using local materials how to generate their own energy and so on i lived in ireland but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized and then i came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that and in order to to introduce you to that i 've got something here that i 'm going to unveil which is one of the great marvels of the modern age and it 's something so astounding and so astonishing that i think maybe as i remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate if you could help me with that it would be fantastic this is a liter of oil this bottle of oil contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor equivalent to about strong people coming round and working for you we can turn it into a dazzling array of a whole range of different things yet when we take a step it 's a short period in history but as we straddle the top of this energy mountain at this stage we move from a time where our economic success our sense of individual prowess and well being is directly and it 's increasingly clear that we aren 't going to be able to rely on the fact that we 're going to have this at our disposal forever there is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling in the 1930s we got one hundred units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it completely unprecedented historically already that but the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic there is also the issue of climate change is the other thing that underpins this transition approach but the thing that i notice as i talk to climate scientists is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes as the data that 's coming in which is far ahead of what the ipcc are talking about if just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms it would offset all the savings that we need to make in carbon over the next forty years to avoid runaway climate change we have no choice other than deep but i 'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us and so abused its inheritance and one of the ways i like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil before we had fossil fuels and people relied on their own muscle animal muscle energy or a little bit of wind water energy we had stories like the seven league boots the giant who had these boots where once you put them on with every stride you could cover seven leagues or twenty one miles a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal stories like the magic porridge pot where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words this pot would just make as much food as you liked without you having to do any work provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge otherwise you 'd flood your entire town there is the story of the elves and the shoemaker the people who make shoes go to sleep wake up in the morning and all the shoes are magically made for them it 's something that was unimaginable to people then now we have the we have but we don 't appreciate what an astonishing and i would argue that there are four there is the idea of business as usual but as we 've seen over the last year i think that 's an idea that is increasingly coming into question there is the idea of hitting the wall that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse this is a popular story in some places the third story is the idea that technology can solve everything that technology can somehow get us through this completely and it 's an idea that i think is very prevalent at these at these ted talks the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable but the world isn 't second life we can 't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse and as we sit exchanging free ideas with each other there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers extracting the minerals to make all of those things is still transported at great distances usually at the expense of the local more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past we can be astonishingly inventive and creative but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands energy and technology are not the same thing and this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face and responding with a and it is something which has several characteristics it 's viral it seems to spread under the radar very very quickly it 's open source it 's something which everybody who 's involved with it develops and there is no great central organization that pushes this people just pick up an idea and they run with it and they implement it where they are it 's solutions focused it 's very much looking at what people can do it 's sensitive to place and to scale transitional is completely different transition groups in chile transition groups in the u s transition groups here what they 're doing looks very different in every place that you go to and it 's a process which is really joyful people have a huge amount of fun doing this reconnecting with other people as they do it and i think in many ways the idea of resilience is a more useful than the idea of sustainability the idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology and it 's really about how and i think it 's a more useful concept than sustainability as i said often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in looking through the lens of resilience we really question how we 've let ourselves get into a situation that 's so vulnerable resilience runs much deeper it 's about building modularity into what we do building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us this is a photograph of the bristol and which we can now only look back on with envy pick up some of the tools that we 've developed they start to run an awareness raising program looking at how this might actually work in in the town they show films they give talks and so on it 's a process which is playful and creative and informative then they start to form working groups looking at different aspects of this and then from that there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and and there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage they are mulling whether they 're going to take it further and actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff but all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front making unelectable policies electable over the next five to ten years some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects like community supported agriculture schemes creating local food directories and so on a lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies community owned energy companies where the community can invest money into itself to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need a lot of places are working with their local schools newent in the forest of dean big polytunnel they built for the school the kids are learning how to grow food planting productive trees throughout urban spaces and also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies this is lewes in sussex who have recently launched the lewes pound a currency that you can only spend within the town as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy you take it anywhere else but actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan which is basically to develop a plan b for the town most of our local authorities when they sit down to plan for the next five ten fifteen twenty years of a community still start by assuming that there will be more energy more cars more housing more jobs more growth and so on what does it look like if that 's not the case and how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody as a friend of mine says life is a series of things you 're not quite ready for and that 's certainly been my experience with transition from three years ago it just being an idea this has become something that has virally swept around the world we 're getting a lot of interest from government ed miliband the energy minister of this country invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener which he did and has since there are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities leicestershire and somerset and in stroud the transition group there in effect wrote the local government 's food plan and the head of the council said if we didn 't have transition stroud we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time as we see the spread of it we see national hubs emerging in scotland the scottish government 's climate change fund has funded transition scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this and but the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now but that things are already inevitably changing and what we need to do is to work creatively with that based on asking the right questions and actually the stories that we tell ourselves we have a huge dearth of and one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing stories about the community that 's produced its own twenty one pound note for example because the last so the question i 'd like to to leave you with really is for all aspects of of the things that your community needs in order to thrive how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions while also building resilience move forward from this point"
