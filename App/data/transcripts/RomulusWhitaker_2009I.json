  "transcript": "you to put off your preconceptions your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles because it 's purely a figment of your imagination okay we are actually the first species on earth to and i know we 've all seen images enough to make us numb of the tragedies that we 're perpetrating on the planet we 're kind of like greedy kids using it all up it 's not only because we like to drink lots of it when i was a kid growing up in new york i was smitten by snakes the same way most kids are cricket balls buying me books on snakes and then starting this infamous career of mine which arriving in india sixty years ago brought by my mother doris norden and my stepfather it 's been a roller coaster ride two animals two iconic reptiles really captivated me very early on one of them was the remarkable gharial this crocodile which grows to almost twenty feet long what my purpose of the talk today really is is to sort because the king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons what you 're seeing here is very recently shot images in a forest nearby here of a female king cobra making her nest here is a limbless animal and then laying her eggs inside to withstand five to ten [ meters of rainfall ] so she protects her eggs and after three months the babies finally do hatch out a majority of them will die of course there is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just ten to twelve inches long and it is a marvelous rain forest this first encounter was kind of like the the maasai boy who kills and it brought me straight into the conservation fray this is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system and try to hang on to what 's there make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean and of course having a good time too you can almost hear the drums throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we 're there it was very important for us to get through to the people and through the children is usually the way to go they are fascinated with snakes they haven 't got that that steely thing that you end up either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way and and relocated them in nearby forests but in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures [ it now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets i had the pleasure of and king cobras feed only on snakes we 're still trying to explain and come to terms with this is again something [ we were able to see and they did this incredible ritual combat dance but a remarkable activity now what are we doing with all this information what 's the point of all this the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests and our job is to convince the authorities by learning as much as we can about something so remarkable and so iconic in order to help protect you 've all heard perhaps of project tiger which started back in the early in fact a very dynamic time for conservation we were piloted i could say by a and this is the time when project tiger emerged and just like project tiger our activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything and now the king cobra is a new one all the major rivers in south india are sourced in the western ghats the chain of hills running along the west coast of india and supplies drinking water to at least three hundred million many babies and of course produces thousands of tons of rice you drink it and the thing is it 's not just big industry it 's not misguided river engineers who are doing all this it 's us it seems that our citizens find now we 're going north very far north it is an animal which has been on the earth for just about one hundred million years it survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off it has remarkable features even though it grows to twenty feet long since it eats only fish it 's not dangerous to human beings it does have big teeth however and it 's kind of hard to convince people if an animal has big teeth that it 's a harmless creature but we actually back in the early so in fact at this point there are only two hundred breeding gharial left in the wild to start projects and pretty soon we were seeing sights like this but complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt and sure enough with all the other pressures on the river like sand mining for example we 're looking at even more problems building up for the gharial despite the early good intentions their nests hatching along the riverside producing hundreds of hatchlings it 's just an amazing sight and luckily there is still a lot of interest my pals in the crocodile specialist group of the but it 's possibly and definitely not enough for example the chambal if you look at it in order to try to find out the answer to this we got veterinarians from all over the world working with indian vets to try to figure out what was happening i was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside and we actually looked through all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on and it came down to something and worse in the joints which made the and it 's a horribly painful death just downriver from the chambal is the filthy yamuna river the sacred yamuna river and i hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it but it 's the truth it 's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine it flows down through and it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain something in the fish they were eating and you know once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected in order to try to answer some of these questions we again turn to technology to putting radios on ten gharial and actually following their movements they 're being watched everyday as we speak to try to find out what this mysterious toxin is the chambal river is an absolutely incredible place it 's a place that the dacoits who used to heavy fishing pressures and fishing is causing problems like this and now new elements of human intolerance for for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don 't drown in the net then they simply cut their beaks off animals like the ganges river dolphin which is just down to a few left and it is also critically the tragedies of dams the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems and development just basically going berserk for a double whether it 's got a happy or sad ending and climate change is certainly going to and you know the decision makers the folks in power they 're up in their bungalows but out on the rivers there are still millions of people who are in really and it 's a bleak future for them people talk about political will during the die off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action government cut through all the red tape we got foreign vets on it it was great so we can do it but if you stroll down to the yamuna or to the gomati in lucknow or to the adyar river in it 's sad but i think the final note really is that the corporates the artists the wildlife nuts and and they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing you know most people are terrified of snakes and there might be quite a few people here who would be very glad to see the last king cobra do you have those conversations with people how do you really get them to care romulus whitaker i take the sort of humble approach i guess you could say but i sort of there is an innocence in these animals and when the average person looks at a cobra going ssssss like that they say my god look at that angry dangerous creature i look at it and that 's what i try to get incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed you were saying that that hasn 't been filmed before rw yes but this guy who we 're following right now is in the deep jungle whereas other king cobras very often come he said i think he 's after the nusha now the nusha means the high whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush"
