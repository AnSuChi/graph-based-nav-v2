  "transcript": "i love looking through people 's garbage there 's switches so you can turn things on and off there 's even a freaking laser so you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot but here 's the thing for and we 're not so one day i was it apart and i had this sudden idea could i dismantle a biological system mix and match the parts and then put it back together in some new and creative way my lab started working on this and i want to show you the result can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is and that 's because we grew human cells into it we took a totally innocent macintosh apple removed all the apple cells and dna and then implanted human cells and what we 're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold this is the stuff that gives plants their and these little holes that you can see this is where all the apple cells used to be what happens is these guys start multiplying and they fill up this entire scaffold as weird as this is it 's actually really reminiscent of how our own you can implant these scaffolds into the body and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive this is the point when people started asking me andrew can you make body parts out of apples and she does a lot of wood carving for a living so i asked her so yeah i know laughter it 's a good lab man and then we grew cells on them listen my lab is not in the because they 're sourced from proprietary products animals or cadavers we used an apple and it cost pennies what 's also really cool here is it 's not that hard to make these things so what we did was put all the instructions online as open source and then we and we 're developing kits to make it easier for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron to make these things at home what i 'm really curious about is if one day it will be possible to repair rebuild and augment our own bodies they 're tasty and they make your pee smell funny and i was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus what you can see are all these tiny little vessels and when we image them in the lab you can see how the cellulose forms these structures this image reminds me of two things our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our nerves so here 's the question can we grow axons and neurons down these channels because if we can then maybe we can use asparagus to form new connections between the ends of damaged and severed nerves or maybe even a spinal cord don 't get me wrong this is exceptionally challenging and really hard work to do and we are not the only ones working on this but we are the only ones using asparagus laughter right now we 've got really promising pilot data and we 're working with tissue engineers and neurosurgeons to find out what 's actually possible so listen all of the work i 've shown the stuff that i 've built that 's all around me on this stage and the other projects my lab is involved in are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage play play is a key part of my scientific practice it 's how i train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative and to decide to make human apple ears so the next time and let 's see what we can build thank you"
