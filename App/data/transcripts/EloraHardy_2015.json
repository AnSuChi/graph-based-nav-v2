  "transcript": "when i was nine years old my mom asked me what i would want my house to look like and i drew this fairy mushroom and then she actually built it i don 't think i realized this was so unusual at the time and maybe i still haven i 'm still designing houses it 's built almost entirely from bamboo the living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor you enter the house by a bridge so we make big curving roofs to catch we made an air conditioned tented bed so instead we made this giant woven pod we do have all the necessary luxuries like bathrooms this one is a basket in the corner of the living room and i 've got tell you some people actually hesitate to use it we have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation so there are lots of things that we 're still working on one thing i have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right it and of the one thousand four hundred and fifty species of bamboo that grow across the world we use just seven of them that 's my dad he 's the one who got me building with bamboo and he is standing in a clump of dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago so we 're talking about and it can take it it 's lightweight light enough to be lifted by just a few men or apparently one woman he chose bamboo and when i first saw these structures under construction about six years ago it 's elegant why hasn 't this happened sooner and what can we do with it next so along with some of the original builders of green school architects and designers and what we 're doing together is creating a new way of building over the past five years together we have built over fifty unique structures most of them in bali nine of them are at green village you 've just seen inside some of these homes we would love to invite you all to come visit someday and while you 're there you can also see green school we keep building classrooms there each year as well as an updated fairy mushroom house we 're also working on a little house for export this is a traditional sumbanese home that we replicated right down to the details and textiles a restaurant with it 's not entirely new from little huts to elaborate bridges like this one in java bamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world for literally tens of thousands of years there are islands and even continents that were first reached by bamboo rafts but until recently it and so that 's why most people especially in asia think that you couldn 't be poor enough and so we thought what will it take to change their minds to convince people much less worth aspiring to borax is a natural salt it turns bamboo into a viable building build something extraordinary out of it inspire people balinese culture fosters craftsmanship it values the artisan so combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects we ask the bamboo what it 's good at and what it says is and bamboo model making it 's an art as well as some hardcore engineering that 's the blueprint of the house and consider each curve and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile to replicate that house on site when it comes down to the details we consider everything how could you make a door better well its hinges battle with gravity and gravity will always win in the end so and while you 're at it why not doors shaped like teardrops we have really had to we have found space for something new it 's a challenge how do you make a ceiling if you don 't have any flat boards to work with let me tell you sometimes i dream of sheet rock and plywood but if what you 've got is skilled craftsmen and itsy bitsy little stretch a canvas over it lacquer it how do you design durable kitchen countertops that do justice to this curving structure you 've just built slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread it is almost entirely handmade the structural connections of our buildings are reinforced by steel joints but we use a lot of bamboo pins there are thousands of pins in each floor this floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin you can feel the texture under bare feet and the floor that you walk on can it affect the way that you walk can it change the footprint that you 'll ultimately leave on the world i remember being nine years old but one thing i know is that with creativity and commitment you can create beauty and comfort and safety and even luxury out of a material that will grow back thank you"
