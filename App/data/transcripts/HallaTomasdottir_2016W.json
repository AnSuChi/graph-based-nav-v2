  "transcript": "i feel incredibly lucky to be from a country that 's generally considered to be the best place in the world to be a woman whether they held professional jobs or had the work of the home they marched into the center of reykjavk ninety percent of women participated and peacefully and in solidarity asked for equality nothing worked in iceland that day because nothing works when women are not at work icelanders had the courage to be the first country in the world to democratically elect a woman as their i will never forget this day stepped out on the balcony of her own home a single mom with her daughter by her side as she had won including boys boys she frequently shares the story of how a young boy approached her after a couple of terms in office and asked can boys really grow up to be president role models really matter but even with such strong role models who i am so grateful i was encouraged to run for president my first reaction was who am i to run for president who am i to be president it turns out that women are less likely to consider running than men so a study done in the us in two thousand and eleven showed that sixty two percent of men so my decision to run ultimately came down to the fact that i felt even if i had no political experience to step up and try to be part of creating the world and a world where we truly allow and it was it was amazing the journey started with potentially as many as twenty candidates it boiled down to nine candidates qualifying and ultimately the race came down to four of us three men and me but that 's not all the drama yet you may think you have drama in the us but i can i can assure you we had our own drama in iceland which is probably what gave rise to so many candidates considering running then later he changed his mind when our prime minister resigned following the infamous panama papers and there was a popular protest in iceland so the sitting president thought they needed a trusted leader and so he withdrew from the race again before doing so he said he was doing that because now there were two qualified men who he felt could fill his shoes running for office so on may nine forty five days i did not even make the graph in the newspaper but that was still the highest that any woman announcing her candidacy had so it would be an understatement to say that i had to work extremely hard to get my seat at the table i found out on the afternoon of the first tv debate that i would participate along with the three men and i found out on live tv that i came in at exactly two point five percent on the day of the first tv debate so challenges the foremost challenges i had to face and overcome on this journey had to do with it proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media and i am not saying media is doing this consciously i think largely this has to do with unconscious bias because in media much like everywhere else and we need to have the courage to talk about it if we want to change it when i finally got access to tv the first question i got was are you going to quit and that was a hard one but of course with one percent to two point five percent in the polls maybe it 's understandable so i know firsthand how much this matters and why we have to talk about it i was the only one out of the final four candidates that never got a front page interview i was sometimes left out of the questions asked of all other candidates and out of coverage i got few if any comments about my hair and pantsuit applause but there is another experience that 's very i ran as an independent candidate not with any political party or muscle behind me that lack of experience and we probably changed the tone of the election for others by doing that it may be the reason why i had less airtime on tv because i wanted to show other contenders respect and we put all the questions i got and all the answers on an open facebook because we thought transparency i became a snapchatter and i actually had to use a lot of humor and humility as i was very bad at it but we grew the following amongst young people by but unfortunately one cannot talk about politics without mentioning money i and we had less financial resources than the other candidates this probably was partly due to the fact that i think i had a harder time asking for financial but even with one third the we managed to surprise everyone when the first numbers came in i surprised myself as you may see in that photo so the first numbers i came in neck to neck to the leading candidate and we went but what really makes me proud is to know that i earned proportionately higher percentage support from the young people and a lot of people encouraged my daughter to run in two thousand and forty and she had never been on tv and she was supportive of her mother this was probably the highlight of my campaign but there was another one these are preschool girls out and they found a poster of me on a bus stop and they saw the need to kiss it audience aw this picture was really enough of a win for me what we see we can be so screw fear and challenges and it 's time for women to run for office be it the office of the ceo or the office of the president i also managed to put an impression on your very own new yorker i earned a new title a living emoji of sincerity and the reason is that women too often get penalized for using what i but i know from experience that we become so good when we do just that and we need more of that because that 's how we felt so you don 't necessarily have to reach that office you just have to go for it and you your family your friends everyone working with you if you do it well you will grow beyond anything you will experience before it was hard work i lost a lot of sleep during those months it took resilience and perseverance as a good sister but your intuition never cheats on you i think it 's also very important and you all know this that on any journey you go on it 's the team you take along it 's having people around you who share your vision but are different in every other way here today an incredible family and great friends and we came together as entrepreneurs in the political arena and pulled something off that everyone said would be impossible as a matter of fact the leading pr expert told me before i made my decision that i would do well to get and he was basing it on valuable experience but on the one percent day i decided here to show him that he was wrong it 's very important to mention this because i did lose a lot of sleep and i worked hard and so did the people with me but it 's equally important maybe even more important to have the courage and i made the decision to go high when and when i lost my energy for a moment and i did from time to time it wasn 't easy and how i had decided to run my own race i and i wanted i decided to enjoy the journey there was a lot to be taken out of the journey no matter if the destination was reached or not and i tried my utmost to inspire others to do so as well because i think if you 're choosing your president you deserve answers to your questions we and i think my entire team will agree with me that it was worth it without saying that probably everybody in the room is ready to move to iceland and vote for you but of course we probably can 't vote there but one thing we can get from iceland and have always gotten is inspiration i mean i 'm old enough to remember when all the icelandic women walked out and that really was a very big factor in launching the women 's movement you made a reference to it earlier i 'd love to bring the picture back up and then what you may not know because our american media did not report it the icelandic women walked out again on monday be the best place in the world to be a woman this is that young women and men participated in greater numbers than before because it is time that we close the pay gap pm so i 'm not going to ask halla to commit right now to what she 's doing next but i will say that you 'd have a very large volunteer army should you decide to do that again"
