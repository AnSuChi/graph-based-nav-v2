  "transcript": "for four months with i think everybody should do it think that you 've got three wishes and what would you do it 's actually a great exercise to to really drill down to the things that you feel are important and really reflect on on the world around us and thinking that can an individual actually inspired by nature i became very interested in the landscape as a canadian so i really had a chance to experience that and i could never really understand exactly what it was or how it was informing me but what i think it was telling me is that is that we are this transient and that the the nature that you see out there the untouched shorelines the untouched forest that i was able to see really bring in a sense of that was a reference point that i think i needed to have to be able to make the work that i did and i did go out and i did this picture of grasses coming through along a roadside this rebirth of grass and then i went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape but as a fine art photographer i somehow felt that it wouldn 't catch on out there that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine art career and i kept kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture or something of that nature and i couldn 't get away from it so i started to think of how can i rethink the landscape i decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we 've transformed i had a bit of an epiphany being lost in pennsylvania and i took a a left turn trying to get back to the highway and i ended up in a town called frackville i got out of the car and i stood up and it was a totally transformed by man and that that got me to go out and look at mines like this and go out and look at the largest and it also became the theme that i felt that i could hold onto and not have to re invent myself that this theme was large enough to become a life 's work to become something that i could sink my teeth into and just and i think one of the things i also wanted to to say in my thanks which i kind of missed was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs to get into that place to make those photographs and if it wasn 't for those people letting me in so in that respect i own a corporation i work with them and i feel that we all need them and they 're important but i am also for sustainability so there 's this thing that is pulling me in both directions and i but it is a slow progression so there 's something that that we 're not seeing there and it 's a scary thing as well because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles and what we 're doing to that landscape is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate and through my photographs i 'm hoping to be able to engage the and to come up to it and not and it 's that forbidden pleasure and it also in a way defines kind of what i feel i 'm drawn to have a good life i want a house and i want a car but there 's this consequence out there and how do i begin to have that attraction repulsion these things that i photographed this tire pile here had it 's around westley california around modesto to me had if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature in the recycling work that you 're seeing here was starting to point to a direction to me it was our redemption that in the recycling work that i was doing i 'm looking for a practice a human activity that is sustainable that if we keep putting things through industrial and and urban existence back into the system if we keep doing that we can continue on of course listening at the conference there 's many many things that are coming bio mimicry and there 's many other things that are coming on stream nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that into that landscape and tear it apart and we all we all look forward to those things but in the meantime these things are scaling up these things are continuing to happen what you 're looking at here i went to bangladesh so i started to move away from north america i started to look at our world globally these images of bangladesh came out of a radio program i was listening to they were talking about exxon and that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned and two thousand and four was going to be the pinnacle and i thought my god wouldn 't that be something to see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand literally in third world countries and then i was able to get into bangladesh a third world a view of it that i had never actually thought was possible one hundred and thirty million people living in an area the size of wisconsin people everywhere the pollution was intense and the working conditions were horrible here you 're looking at some oil fields in california some of the biggest oil fields and again i started to think that there was another epiphany that the whole world i was living in was a result of having plentiful oil and that to me was again something that i started building on and i continued to build on so this is a series i 'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years under the heading of the oil party because i think everything that we 're involved in our clothing our cars our roads and everything are directly a result i 'm going to move to and for me china and my father worked at gm so i was very familiar with with that kind of industry and that also informed but you know to see china and the scale at which it 's evolving is quite something and this is the largest dam by fifty percent ever attempted by man most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said it 's just too big it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning it took fifteen days to fill it so this this created a reservoir six hundred kilometers long one of the largest reservoirs ever created and what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving demolished by hand i think eleven of the buildings they used dynamite everything else was by hand that was ten weeks later and and it was all the people who lived in those homes were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart and these are some of the images from that so i spent about three trips to the three gorges dam looking at that massive transformation of a landscape and it looks like a bombed out landscape but it isn 't what it is it 's a landscape that is an intentional one this is and they 're willing to go through this massive transformation on this scale and again there hasn 't been one built in north america for twenty years because of the nimby problem not in my backyard but in china they 're saying hydroelectric power literally and one of the other things that happened in the three gorges a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that and one point two to two million people were relocated depending on whose statistics you 're looking at is what they were building this is wushan one of the largest cities that was relocated this is the town hall for the city and again the rebuilding of the city to me it was sad to see that they didn 't really grab a lot of i guess what we know here in terms of urban planning there were no parks there were no green spaces on the side of a hill and here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up but somehow were not connecting with them it has all the trappings of western culture you 're seeing the tuxedos the bouquets but what 's really to me frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background so it 's like marrying up all the things that we have and it 's an adaptation of full stop and again when you start seeing that kind of and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint it starts to become very sobering this is a shot in one of the biggest squares in guangdong and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country and there 's about one hundred and thirty million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times and in the next ten to fifteen years are expecting another four five hundred million people to migrate into the urban centers like shanghai and the manufacturing centers the manufacturers are the domestics are usually you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms so this is a pink uniform at this factory it 's a shoe factory and they have dorms for the this is one of the biggest shoe factories the yuyuan shoe factory near shenzhen this is one with forty five thousand so every lunch there 's about twelve thousand coming through for lunch they sit down they have about twenty minutes the next round comes in it 's an incredible workforce that 's shanghai i 'm looking at the urban renewal in shanghai and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years what 's also happening in shanghai is china is changing because this wouldn 't have happened five years ago for instance this is a holdout and so they 're holding off until they get a deal with them and they 've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal they 're being put out about two hours but these are a whole series of of guys holding probably the largest and then the embrace of the things that they 're replacing it with again one of my wishes and i never ended up going there was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house the kinds of collisions of styles and things were and these are called the villas and also like right now they 're just moving the scaffolding is still on and this is an e waste area and if you looked in the foreground on the big print you 'd see that the industry their industry they 're all recycling so the industry 's already growing around these new new was a very intriguing city it 's exploding on a level that that i don 't think any city has experienced in fact even shenzhen the economic zone one of the first ones fifteen years ago was about one hundred thousand people and today it boasts about ten to eleven million so that gives you an idea of the kinds migrations and the speed with which this is just the taxis being built by volkswagen there 's nine thousand of them here and they 're being built for and this isn 't even the domestic car market this is the and they just go up in the same way as and the density is quite quite and one of the things in this picture that i wanted to point out is that when i saw these kinds of buildings i was shocked to see that they 're not using a central air conditioning system every window has an air conditioner in it and i 'm sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about efficiencies but i can 't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale and when you start looking at that and then you start factoring up into it 's breathtaking in terms of the speed at which this it 's still one of the last areas that was being held up right now that 's all cleared out this was done about eight months ago and high rises are now going up into that central spot so built literally overnight in in shanghai most recently i went in and i started looking at some of the biggest industries in in china and this is baosteel right outside of it 's an incredibly so they 're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel so this is and again looking at these images there 's this constant like haze that you 're seeing this is going to show you real time an assembler it 's a circuit breaker with china is that they 're using a lot of the latest and then i went and looked at each one of them for about fifteen or twenty minutes and picked and it was just lightning fast way she was working was almost unbelievable but that that is the trick that they 've got but the assembly is where they 're actually bringing in the country workers are very willing to work they want to work there 's a massive backlog of that condition 's going to be there for the next ten to fifteen years if realize what they want which is you know four hundred to five hundred million more people coming into the cities in this particular case this is the assembly line that you saw this is a shot of it i had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field i had to have them freeze for ten seconds to get this shot to slow them down was literally impossible they were just wound up doing these things all day long until the manager had to with a stern voice five hundred of these machines they 're worth about two hundred thousand dollars each so you have about twelve people running this and they 're just inspecting it and they 're just walking the lines the machines are all running absolutely incredible to see to see what the scale of industries are and i started getting in further and further into the factories this is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together here 's something that 's far far more labor intensive which is the company and they 're doing it was very hard to get into the international companies because i had to get permission from companies like nike and adidas and that 's very hard to get and they don 't want to let me in but the domestic was much easier to do it just gives you a sense of again and that 's where really the whole migration of jobs started going over to this is a high tech mobile phone bird mobile phone one of the largest mobile makers in china and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones textile where they 're doing shirts youngor the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in china and everything is very efficient one of the biggest factories i 've ever seen they make coffeemakers here the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers they make twenty million of them in the world there 's twenty one thousand employees so you 're the first ones to be seeing these these new factory pictures i 've taken so it 's taken me almost a year to gain access into these into these places so a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to china by ships that 's cubed metal from electrical motors this is certainly connected to california and silicon valley but this is what happens to most of the computers fifty percent of the world 's computers end up in china to be recycled and it is a bit of a problem the way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes which are used all through china they heat up the boards and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components they 're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components but the toxic smells when you come into a town that 's that 's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards you can smell it a good five or ten kilometers before you get there even in their homes they 're burning boards if there 's a concern for for somebody coming by because it is considered in china to be illegal doing it but they can 't stop the this portrait i 'm not usually known for portraits but i couldn 't resist this one where she 's been through mao and she 's been through the great leap forward and the cultural revolution this is a road where it 's been shored up by by computer boards in one of the biggest towns so that 's the photographs that i wanted to show you i want to dedicate my wishes to my two and to me the whole notion the things i 'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress and as much as there are great things around the corner and it 's palpable in this room of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems i 'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect and it isn 't something that isn 't just affecting our world but it starts to go up because i think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down but and so i don 't think we can equalize it so ultimately the strategy i think here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well and thinking about and also wish one i want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global and it is through communications today that i believe that that is not an and i went in search i wanted to put what i had in mind hitch it onto something i didn 't want a wish just to start from nowhere one of them i 'm starting from almost nothing but the other one i wanted to find out what 's going on that 's working right now and and that and it just started about fourteen fourteen months ago and the beauty of what 's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that i like what they 're doing there is that they 're not i think the environmental movement has failed in that it 's used the stick too much it 's the apocalyptic tone too much it hasn 't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is quickly and it 's looking at technology and it 's looking at new energy saving devices and it 's looking at how to rethink and how to and so for me one of the things that i thought would be to put some of my work in the service of of promoting the some of you might know he 's a tedster stephen sagmeister and i can be placed into any kind of media they could be posted through the web they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter or anything of that nature so we 're looking at this as trying to build out according to stephen is less than five percent of of ads are actually leading with image and so in this case because it 's about a lot of these images and what they represent and the kinds of questions they bring up that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone images have to do and hopefully inspire people to go to that website so and building that blog and it is a blog and i 'm hoping that it isn 't i don 't see it as the kind of blog where we 're all going to follow each other to death this one is one that will spoke out and will go out and to start reaching because right now there 's conversations in india in china in south america there 's entries coming from all around the world i think there 's a chance to have a dialogue a conversation about sustainability at and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic wish two is more of the one that i 'm trying to work with and this one is i wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas said something earlier on in a brainstorming she said that recycling in canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six and and you know what happens at puberty you know we know that from earlier presentations so my my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas let them understand what sustainability is and that they have a vested interest in it to and one of the ways i thought of doing it is to use my prize so i would take but the other thing that i thought would be fantastic was to create these call them prize targets and so one could be for the best sustainable sustainable idea for an the best and i also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for in my world and what would happen it 's a scalable thing and if we can get people to put in things whether it 's equipment like a to make the prize significant enough and to open it up to all the schools that that are public schools or schools that are with kids that age and make it a wide open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them and the prize has to be a verifiable thing so it 's not about just ideas the art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them but the actual things have to be that way what 's happening is that we 're motivating a certain age group to start thinking and they 're going to push that up from the bottom up into and i think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability they know but they don 't really i think get sustainability in all the things and the energy footprint and how that matters and to teach them to me would be a fantastic wish and it would be something that i would certainly put my shoulder into and again in in my world the competition we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it and i like the words in my world because it gives possession of the world to the person who 's doing it it is my world it 's not someone else 's i want to help it i want to do something with it so i think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations and great ideas i think come from kids and engage their imagination into a project and do something for schools i think all schools could use extra equipment extra cash it 's going to be an incentive for them to do that these are some of the the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some some promotion for in my world so i was told i should do one for myself and i 've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something and the scale of my work and the kinds of ideas i 'm playing with when i first saw an imax film i photographer and i think there 's a real possibility to reach new audiences if i had a chance so i 'm looking really for a mentor because i so i need somebody who can put me on a quick catch up course on how to do something like that and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this that would be fantastic so those are my three wishes"
