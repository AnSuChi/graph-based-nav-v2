  "transcript": "it 's inevitable terrible but really what i want to talk about is i 'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die that 's what i want to talk about so art buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died saying hi i 'm art buchwald and i just died who i met at galapagos a trip which i won at ted and my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook in the last two years of his life when he was sick he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me and gentle suggestions for improvement and held a mirror to my life after he died i realized that no one writes to me anymore handwriting is a disappearing art i 'm all for email and thinking while typing but why give up old habits for new there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy and trade all those years but too late but that 's when i take out his letters so maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy and not a financial one a value for things with a personal touch an autographed book a soul searching letter if a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper john it 'll be a recycled one and write a beautiful letter to someone they love we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes i collect autographed books and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them and cds too tracy i plan to publish my own notebook as i witnessed my father 's body being swallowed by fire i sat by his funeral pyre and and leave that published book for my son"
