  "transcript": "to tell you from the bottom of thank you so very very much do you know to date the als association has raised one hundred and million dollars woo hoo it takes me back to the summer of my family my kids had all grown up we were officially empty nesters and we decided let 's go on a family vacation jenn my daughter who had played at and had now come home and was selling group insurance he also joined us and one night i found myself having a beer with pete i don 't know selling group insurance is just not my passion he said i don 't feel this is my mission in life i have to leave early from vacation because my inter city league team that i play for and i have to get back to boston because i can 't let my team down i 'm just not as passionate about my job as i am about baseball so off pete went and left the family vacation break a mother 's heart and he went and we followed four days later to see the next playoff game we 're at the playoff game pete plate and a fastball 's coming in and it hits him on the wrist oh pete so for the next six months pete went back to his home in southie kept working that unpassionate job six months later in march called my husband and me and he said oh mom and dad we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist do you want to come with the doctor 's appointment with me i said sure we 'll come in john and i all got up got dressed got in our cars three separate cars because we were going to go to work after the doctor 's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist we walked into the neurologist 's office sat down four doctors walk in and the head neurologist sits down and i have to tell you it 's not a sprained wrist it it 's not lyme where is he going with this then he put his hands on his knees he looked right at my 27 year old kid and said i don 't know how to tell a what treatment let 's go what do we do let 's go and he looked at us and he said i 'm sorry to tell you this but there 's no treatment and there 's no cure we were the worst culprits we didn 't even understand that it had been seventy five years since lou gehrig and nothing had been done in the progress against als andrew came home from charlestown and pete went to b c to pick up his then girlfriend julie and brought her home and six hours later after diagnosis we 're sitting around having a family dinner set the vision he said there will be no wallowing people he goes we 're not looking looking forward what an amazing opportunity we have to change the world i 'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of going to move the needle and i 'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like bill gates and that was it we were given our directive so in the days and months that followed within a week we had left his apartment in charlestown and says i 'm going to take care of pete and be his six months after diagnosis pete was given an award at a research summit for advocacy got up and gave a very eloquent speech and at the end of the speech there was a panel and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives and biochemists and clinicians and i 'm sitting there and i 'm listening to them and most of the content went straight over my head i avoided every science class i ever could but i was watching these people and i was listening to them and they were saying i i do this i do that and there was a and i look at them and i say thank you thank you so much for working in als it means so very much to us i said but i do have to tell you that i 'm watching your body language and i 'm listening to what you 're saying it just doesn 't seem like there 's a whole lot of collaboration going on here follow up and the accountability what are you going to do after you leave this room and then i turned around and there was about two hundred pairs of eyes and it was that that point that i realized thus my mission had begun so over the next couple of years pete we 've had our highs and our lows pete was put on a compassionate use drug it was hope in a bottle for the whole als community it was in a phase iii trial then six months later the data comes back no efficacy we just watched my son be taken away from me little by little every day two and a half years ago pete was hitting home runs at baseball fields he talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device and we 're watching his lungs because his diaphragm eventually is going to give out and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not als robs the human of all their physical so july fourteen 75th year of lou gehrig 's inspirational speech twenty days later the ice started to fall on july wearing a quinn for the win shirt signifying pat quinn another als patient known in new york and b c shorts said i 'm taking the als ice bucket challenge picked up the ice put it over his head and i 'm nominating and he sent it up to boston and that was on july the nice thing about facebook is that you have the dates you can go back you 've got to see uncle artie 's human bloody mary and that was probably in day two and i get a text from him what the hell is going on so we got together put our best five hundred and week two national media it was during week two that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor saying i think you people might need food in there my husband did japanese television it was interesting who 's seen that one j t justin timberlake that 's when we knew that was a real i go back on my texts and i i can see and the als patients you know what their favorite ones are and their families ' all of them they just sat and watched people saying it over and over it was shall we okay so the als association they think by year end it 'll be one hundred and sixty million dollars in cambridge they raised three million dollars well guess what they had a clinical trial for a drug that they 've been developing it was on a three year track for funding has reported that over one hundred and fifty countries have posted ice bucket challenges for als and facebook two point five and i had the awesome adventure visiting the facebook campus last week and i said to them i know what it was like in my house i can 't imagine what it was like around here all she said was he told us check now on to the treatment and cure the first thing is every morning when you wake up you can choose to live your day in positivity would any of you blame me if i just was in the fetal position and pulled the but pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be positive and proactive i actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals that 's the second thing i want to leave you with is the person at the middle of the challenge has to be willing to have the mental toughness to put themselves out there and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages you 'll see the because he wants them to see what the reality of this is and how he 's never ever going to give up and the third thing i want to leave you with if you ever come across a situation that you see i want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it i have had twenty nine years of having the honor of being the mother of pete frates he walks the face of the earth right the second thing that my son has given me is he 's given me my mission in life and if it doesn 't happen in time for him i 'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what i 'm going through and the third thing and last but not least gift that my son has given me as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of august two thousand and fourteen and pete and julie have given me my granddaughter coworkers and teammates be passionate and don 't forget to be great"
