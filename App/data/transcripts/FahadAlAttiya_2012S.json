  "transcript": "i am in charge of making this country 's food secure that is my job for the next two years to design an entire master plan and then for the next ten years to implement it which is my story about the story of this country that you 're all here in today so going in what were about eleven thousand people living here fishing or were nomads who none of the glamour that you see today existed no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi or kuwait or riyadh it wasn 't that they couldn 't develop cities resources weren 't there to develop them and you can see that life expectancy was also short most people died around the age of fifty so let 's move to chapter two the oil era one thousand nine but unfortunately it wasn 't really fully exploited commercially until after the second world war what did it do it changed the face of this country as you can see today and witness it also made all those people who roamed around the desert trying to take care of their livestock but in my family we have different accents my mother has an accent that there are about five or six accents in this country as i speak someone says how so how could this happen because we lived scattered we couldn 't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no and when the resources came be it oil we started building these fancy technologies and bringing people together because we needed the concentration so what 's the population today it 's one point seven million people that is in less than sixty years the average growth of our economy is about fifteen percent seventy eight water consumption has increased to four hundred and thirty liters and this is amongst the highest worldwide from having no water whatsoever but what is interesting about the story that i 've just said the interesting part is that we continue to grow fifteen percent every year for the past not only cities that we 're building but cities with dreams these people are adamant that this is a livable space but of course with the use of technology so brazil has one thousand seven hundred and eighty two millimeters per year of precipitation of rain qatar has seventy four and we have that growth rate the question is how how could we survive that we have no water whatsoever simply because of this gigantic mammoth machine desalination energy is the key factor here it changed everything so that is our lake if you can see it that is our river that is how you all happen to use this is the best technology that this region perhaps if you look at the global facts you will realize of course i have to worry there is growing demand growing population we 've turned seven billion only a few months ago so a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders there 's also changing diets socio economic level they also change their diet they start eating more meat and so on and so forth on the other hand there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors and so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen this is the situation in qatar for those who don 't know and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land the limited number of farmers that we have have been pushed out of their farming practices as a result so we also face risks these risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity the indeed there is this slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents that we 've been working on over the past two years fossil fuel or should we use something else do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy i guess most of you by now realize that we do three hundred days of sun and we will probably put one thousand eight hundred megawatts of solar systems to produce three point five million cubic meters of water and that is a lot of water that water will go then to the farmers and the farmers will be able to water their plants but in order to sustain the horizontal line because these are the projects these are the systems that we will deliver we need to also develop the vertical line system sustenance industries technologies to produce these technologies for application and finally markets but what gels all of it what enables it is legislation without it we can 't do anything so that 's what we are planning to do within two years we should hopefully just like damascus thank you very much"
