  "transcript": "i 'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture we tended to die at home in our own beds looked after by family although that was the default because a lot of people lacked access to medical care we developed new medicines like penicillin so we could treat those infectious diseases and they became our after the second world war a lot of countries set up universal healthcare systems so that everyone who needed treatment could get it the result was that lifespans extended from about forty five at the start of the century to almost double that today but with all of the focus on life death was forgotten even as our approach to death changed dramatically during that period we 'll likely spend a lot of time in hospitals and hospices and care homes we 've all been in a modern but the surprising thing is it wasn 't always like this this is l 'ospedale degli and when i look at this building and then think about hospitals today what amazes me is this building 's ambition it 's just a really great building it has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings so they just feel more comfortable to be in we 've forgotten that that 's even possible for a hospital if we want better buildings for dying then we have to talk about it but because we find the subject of death uncomfortable we don 't talk about it and we don 't question how we as a society approach death one of the things that surprised me most in my research though is how changeable attitudes actually are this is the first crematorium in the u k which was built in woking in the cremation wasn 't socially acceptable and ninety nine point eight percent of people got three quarters of us get cremated people are actually really open to changing things if they 're given the chance to talk about them so this conversation about death and architecture was what i wanted to start when i did my first exhibition on it in venice in june which was called death in venice it was designed to be quite playful so that people would literally engage with it this is one of our exhibits which is an interactive map of london that shows just how much of the real estate in the city we wanted to show that where we die is a key part of how we die and at a certain point they would kind of stop and remember that they were in an exhibition about death and that maybe that 's not how you 're supposed to act but actually i would question whether there is one way that you 're supposed to act around death and mightn 't it be a little less like this and a little more like this"
