  "transcript": "prejudice and bias we tend to think about stupid and evil people doing stupid and evil things and this idea is nicely summarized by the british critic william hazlitt who wrote prejudice is the child of ignorance i want to try to convince you here that this is mistaken i want to try to convince you that prejudice and bias are natural they 're often rational and they 're often even moral and we 're in a better position to know what to do when this happens you know my you could make guesses about my ethnicity and we 're very good at this sort of thing because our ability to stereotype people is not some sort of arbitrary quirk and we can use our experience to make generalizations about novel the dog might not bark and in fact this is my dog tessie who doesn 't bark for the most part we make good guesses both in the social domain and and the non social domain and if we weren 't able to do so if we weren 't able to make guesses about new instances he writes without the aid of prejudice nor what to feel in any relation of life other times we 're proud of it we openly acknowledge it anderson cooper gets to your question the question in the hall on foreign aid yes ma 'am woman the american people are suffering in our country right now why do we continue to send foreign aid to other which is as americans we should care more about americans than about other people pride patriotism towards their country or towards their ethnic group regardless of your politics many people feel to be american and they favor americans over other countries residents of other countries feel the same about their nation but even you sophisticates accept that there should be some pull in the domain of friends and family of people you 're close to and so even you make a distinction between us versus them and this was part of the research of the great social psychologist henri he left to go to university in france because as a jew he couldn 't go to university in poland and in fact when the war ended and he was released most of his friends and family were dead he got involved in different pursuits he helped out the war orphans but he had a long lasting science of prejudice and so when a prestigious british scholarship on stereotypes opened up he applied for it and he won it viewed the holocaust as sort of representing some tragic flaw on the part of the germans some genetic what we see in the holocaust is and then based on their answers he said i 've looked at your you love the work of klee he just arbitrarily divided them up but what he found was these categories mattered so when he later gave the subjects money they would prefer to give the money to members of their own group than members of they were actually most interested in establishing a difference so my colleague and wife karen wynn at yale has done a series of studies with babies where she exposes babies to puppets and the but the question is does this matter to babies they tend to prefer the puppet who has the same food tastes they actually prefer puppets who punish the puppet with the different food taste laughter we see this sort of in group out group psychology all the time we see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies we see it in its extreme but dehumanized as in the nazi perspective of jews as vermin or lice or the american perspective of of japanese as rats so often they 're rational and useful but sometimes they 're irrational they give the wrong answers and other times and the case there was a fascinating study prior to the two thousand and eight election where social psychologists and in one of their studies they compared obama and mccain and they found mccain is thought of as more american than obama and to some extent people aren 't that surprised by hearing that mccain is a celebrated war hero and many people would explicitly say he has more of an american story than obama but they also compared and they found that blair was also thought of as more american than obama even though subjects explicitly understood that he 's not american at all but they were responding of course to the color of his skin in one recent study researchers put ads on ebay for the sale of baseball cards some of them were others by black hands they were the same baseball cards the ones held by black hands got substantially smaller bids than the ones held by white hands in research done at stanford of a white person it turns out holding everything else constant you are considerably more likely to be executed if you look like the man on the right than the man on the left and this is in large part because the man on the right looks more prototypically black how do we combat it and there are and we often do that through stories so if if you are a liberal parent and you want to you might give them a book like this and the idea that that we care about people when we focus on them as individuals is an idea which has shown up across history so stalin a single death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic and mother teresa said if i look at the mass i will never act if i look and it was seen how much they would donate and another group was given no facts at all but they were told of an individual and given a name and it turns out that they gave far more none of this i think is a secret to the people who are engaged in charity work people don 't tend to deluge people with facts and statistics rather you show them faces you show them people it 's possible that by extending our sympathies to an individual they can spread to the group that the individual belongs to this is harriet beecher stowe the story perhaps apocryphal is that president lincoln invited her to the white house in the middle of the civil war and said to her so you 're the little lady who started this great war and he was talking about uncle tom 's cabin uncle tom 's cabin is not a great book of philosophy or of theology or or perhaps not even literature but it does a great job of getting people to put themselves in the shoes of people they wouldn 't otherwise be in the shoes of several decades there 's some reason to believe that shows like the cosby show radically changed american attitudes towards african americans while shows like will and grace and modern family changed american attitudes towards gay men and women i don 't think it 's an exaggeration to say that the major catalyst in america for moral change has been a situation comedy and i want to end by appealing to the power of reason the old testament says i know i have obligations to them but my moral feelings my moral beliefs about about how i should behave towards them and to support this he tells a story and i want to tell this story too though i 'm going to modify it a little bit for modern times so adam smith starts by asking you to imagine the death of thousands of people and imagine that the well that 's too bad and you we go about our lives but imagine instead smith says you were to learn that tomorrow you were to have your little finger chopped smith says that would matter a lot you would not sleep that night wondering about that so this raises the question absolutely not what a horrid thought and so this raises the question and so as smith puts it when our passive feelings are almost always so sordid and so selfish how comes it that our active principles should often be so generous and so noble smith 's answer is it is reason principle conscience [ this ] calls to us with a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions that we are but one of the multitude in no respect better than any other in it and this last part is what is often described as the principle and this principle of impartiality manifests itself in all of the world 's religions in all of the different versions of the golden and in all of the world 's moral philosophies which differ in many ways but share the presupposition that we should judge morality from sort of an impartial point of view but from humphrey bogart at the end of casablanca so spoiler alert he 's telling his lover that they have to separate for the more general good and he says to her and i won 't do the accent but he says to her it doesn 't take much to see that the problems of three little people don 't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world our reason could cause us to override our passions our reason could motivate us to extend our empathy could motivate us to write a book like uncle tom 's cabin or read a book like uncle tom 's cabin and our reason can motivate us to create customs and taboos and laws that will constrain us upon our impulses when as rational beings we feel we should be constrained this is what a constitution is and we bind ourselves in other ways as well we know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job we are biased by how attractive they are and sometimes we might say well fine that 's the way it should be but other times we say this is wrong so the only information they have is the information they believe should matter i think prejudice and bias we have gut and they affect our judgments and our actions for good and for evil and it 's in this way that reason helps us create a better world"
