  "transcript": "we 've got some of the most incredible video of titanic that 's ever been seen and we 're not going to show you any of it truth of the matter is that the titanic even though it 's breaking all sorts of box office records it 's not the most exciting story from the sea and the problem i think is that and you look out at this great big blue expanse and it 's shimmering and it 's moving and there 's waves and there 's surf and there 's tides but you have no idea for what lies in there and in the oceans there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet most of the animals are in the oceans it 's mostly unexplored and yet there and the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony marcel proust said the true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having people that have partnered with us have given us new eyes not only on what exists the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea it gets up to about one hundred and fifty feet long but see all those different working things i love that kind of stuff it 's got these fishing lures on the bottom they 're going up and down it 's got tentacles dangling swirling around like that it 's a colonial animal these are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature and it 's got these jet thrusters up in front that it 'll use in a moment and a little light if you take all the big fish and and schooling fish and all that put them on one side of the scale put all the jelly type of animals on the other side those guys win hands down most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this here 's the use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating we couldn 't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies they come in all different sizes and shapes bill lange we tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average and that we 're real familiar with the animals that are in the first two hundred or three hundred feet but we 're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom and these are the types of animals that live in that three dimensional space that micro gravity environment that we really haven 't explored you hear about giant squid and things like that but some of these animals get up to be approximately one hundred and forty one hundred and sixty feet long they 're very little understood dg this is one of them another one of our favorites because it 's a little octopod you can actually see through his head and here he is flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up we see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths mid ocean and we see creatures like this this is what a face this is basically scientific data that you 're looking at it 's footage that we 've collected for scientific purposes and that 's one of the things that bill 's been doing is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this in the world where they belong they don 't catch them in a net they 're actually looking at them down in that world we 're going to take a joystick sit in front of our computer on the earth and press the joystick forward and fly around the planet we 're going to look at the mid ocean ridge nine degrees north we make maps of these mountain ranges with sound with sonar and this is one of those mountain ranges we 're coming around a cliff here on the right and you can sit in a room like this with a joystick and a headset and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time one of the things we 're trying to do at woods hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world this world this unexplored region back to the laboratory because we see it in bits and pieces right now we see it either as sound or we see it as video this is what 's called a hydrothermal vent and what you 're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor gets up to six hundred seven and we knew it was volcanic back in the and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it because if you 've got volcanism water 's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor come in contact with magma and come shooting out hot we weren 't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides hydrogen sulfides we didn 't have any idea about these things which we call chimneys this one of these hydrothermal vents six hundred degree f water coming out of the earth on either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the alps so the setting here is very dramatic bl the white material is is a type of bacteria that thrives at one hundred and eighty degrees c dg and we started to wonder for long time how did it all get down there what we find out now is that it 's probably coming from inside the earth not only is it coming out of the earth so biogenesis made from volcanic activity but that bacteria supports these colonies of life the pressure here is four thousand pounds per square inch a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles no sun has ever gotten down here all the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the earth so chemosynthesis and you can see how dense the population is these are called tube worms bl these worms have no digestive system they have no mouth another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria which takes the hydrothermal fluid that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest dg you can see here 's a crab that lives down there he 's managed to grab a tip of these worms now they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them oh good going so as soon as a crab touches them they retract down into their shells just like your fingernails there 's a whole story being played out here that we 're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this these worms live in a real temperature extreme their foot is at about two hundred degrees c and their head is out at three degrees c so it 's like having having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water that 's how they like to live dg this is a you watch it doesn 't take long before two guys here this one and one that will show up over here start to fight here they go on one of the last dive series we counted two hundred species in these areas one hundred and ninety eight were new new species bl one of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites it 's rather difficult to collect these animals and they disintegrate on the way up so the imagery is is critical for the science dg two octopods at about two miles depth this pressure thing really amazes me that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the titanic like an empty pepsi can what we saw up till now was from the pacific this is from the atlantic even greater depth you can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here and he 'll bat it away with his claw whack what they 're getting at is that on the back of this crab the foodstuff here very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals and what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals and the crabs don 't like it at all these long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria so the bacteria grows hair on the crab on the back you see this again the red dot is the laser light of the submarine alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents here and here coming out they 're clinging to a rock face here 's a tiny little vent that 's come out of the side of so here you 've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground they don 't need the sun v shaped mark on the back of the shrimp it 's actually a light sensing organ it 's how they find the hydrothermal vents the vents are emitting a black body radiation an ir signature and so they 're able to to find these vents at considerable all this stuff is happening along that 40 000 mile long mountain range that we 're calling the ribbon of life because just even today as we speak there 's life being generated there from volcanic activity in it you 'll see that it 's a habitat for a lot of different animals there 's a funny kind of hot plate here with vent water coming out of it so all of these are individual homes for worms i think this is the neatest looking thing i just can 't get over this that you 've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away this stuff is toxic as hell by the way you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean and it 's coming out all from and animals are thriving and we probably came from here that 's probably where we evolved from bl this bacteria that we 've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found although the vent sites an individual site may last only ten years or so as an ecosystem they 've been stable for for millions well billions of years dg you see there 're some fish inside here as well there 's a fish sitting here here 's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm waiting for that worm to stick his head out bl the biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active the worms are growing inches per week and then there 's earthquakes and then volcanic eruptions on the order of one every five years that completely wipes the area out"
