  "transcript": "i 'll begin today by sharing a poem but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote i found her poem so i 'll read it to you she entitled her poem i 'll marry when i want my mother can 't force me to marry my father cannot force me no one in the world can force me to marry i even if and not before i am all grown up i 'll marry when i want but where i and eileen come from i am from malawi malawi is one of the poorest countries very poor gender equality is questionable i couldn 't even explore personal opportunities in life i will tell you a story of two different girls two beautiful girls these girls grew up under the same roof but their lives ended up differently in two different paths the other girl is my little sister my little sister was only eleven years old when she got pregnant it 's a hurtful thing i was going through a hard time as well once you reach puberty you are supposed to go to initiation camps you are taught how to sexually please a man which they call very special day where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls she ended up being she 's only sixteen years old and she has three children nor did her second marriage on the other side there is this girl she 's amazing you 're supposed to go to the initiation camp go to the initiation camps stubborn you do not respect the traditions of our society of our community i said no because i knew where i was going i knew what i wanted in life i had a lot of dreams as a young girl i wanted to get well educated those were the imaginations that were going through my but every day after refusing women would tell me and that is the music that girls hear every day when they don 't do something that the community needs them to do i said why can 't i do something why can 't i change something that has happened for a long time in our community that was when i called other girls who have children who have been i said come on we can remind each other how to read and write again how to hold the pen how to read to hold the book but they were able to tell me their personal stories what they were facing every day as young mothers mothers that was when i was like ' why can 't we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers our traditional leaders that these are the wrong things it was a scary thing to do because these traditional leaders they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages a hard thing to change but a good and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be in my community we were determined to fight for girls but even in other communities we were there at the parliament house every day when the members of parliament were entering we were telling them would you please support the bill but we have our phones so we said why can 't we get it was a good thing so when the bill passed we texted them back thank you for supporting the bill and when the bill was signed by the but let me tell you this there are countries where eighteen is it means keeping girls ' issues at heart every time we don 't have to be subjected as second but they have to know that women as we are in this room and not just malawi but other countries the laws which are you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced the law they need to be publicized at the local level at the community level where girls ' issues are very striking difficult issues at the community level every day they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them and another thing i would say is that girls ' voices and women 's voices are beautiful they are there male advocates they have to jump in to step in and work together it 's a collective work what we need is what girls elsewhere need good education and above all not to marry whilst eleven we can transform the legal the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights i am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation this is the moment where a girl and a girl and millions of girls worldwide will be able to say i will marry when i want"
