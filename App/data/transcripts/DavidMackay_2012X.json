  "transcript": "when the industrial revolution started the amount of carbon sitting underneath britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under saudi arabia in the form of oil and then in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen and has declined ever since and in the year two thousand oil and gas production from the north sea also peaked and they 're now on the decline secure fossil fuels what is life after fossil fuels going to be like shouldn 't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels another motivation of course is climate change i think there 's a lot of fluff a lot of greenwash a lot of misleading advertising let me illustrate this with what physicists call a what if we grew the biofuels for a road on the grass verge at the edge of the road how wide wide would the verge have to be for that to work out ok let 's say they do thirty miles per gallon that 's the european average for new cars let 's say the productivity of biofuel plantations is one thousand two hundred liters of biofuel per hectare per year that 's true of european the length of the road doesn 't matter because the longer the road the more biofuel plantation that 's how wide the plantation would have to be given these assumptions and maybe that makes you say hmm maybe this isn 't going to be quite so easy the answer is going to be yes but it depends which country you are in so let 's start in the united kingdom since that 's where we are today the energy consumption of the united kingdom the total energy consumption not just transport everything i like to quantify it in lightbulbs it 's as if we 've all got one hundred and twenty five lightbulbs on all the time one hundred and so there 's forty lightbulbs ' worth for transport forty lightbulbs ' worth for heating and forty lightbulbs ' worth for making electricity and other things are relatively small compared to those three big fish so that 's the i 'm going to show you how many lightbulbs what our energy consumption per person is we 're at one hundred and twenty five lightbulbs per person and that little blue dot there is showing you the land area of the united kingdom and you can see there 's quite a variety i should emphasize both of these axes are logarithmic as you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you 're going up a factor of ten next let 's add asia in red the middle east and north africa in green sub saharan africa in blue australia and new zealand we have canada and australia with enormous land areas very high per capita consumption two hundred or three hundred lightbulbs per person bahrain has the same energy consumption per person roughly as canada bangladesh has the same population density bottom left china india bangladesh that 's bigger population density and higher per capita consumption so we may be off in the top japan south korea the netherlands and a bunch of other slightly odd countries but many other countries are coming up and to the right to join us so we 're a picture if you like of what the future energy consumption might be looking like in other countries too which i measure in watts per square mexico in purple and bangladesh fifteen years ago and japan is consuming a bit more so why is it relevant well we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units renewables is one of the leading so here come some renewables energy crops deliver half a watt per square meter in european climates we consume one point two five watts what this means is even if you covered the whole of the united kingdom with energy crops you couldn 't match today 's energy consumption so that means if you wanted literally to produce i 've got data to next let 's look at solar power and coat the wind farms two point five solar parks about five so whichever of those renewables you pick whatever mix of those renewables you 're using if you want to power the uk on them you 're going to need to cover something like twenty percent or twenty five percent i 'm not saying that 's a bad idea we just need to understand the numbers i 'm absolutely not anti renewables i love renewables but i 'm also concentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area because you don 't have the problem of clouds i think it 's perfectly britain doesn 't have any deserts laughter so here 's a summary so far all renewables much as i love them and that means if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the united kingdom on the scale of today 's consumption you need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country sized not the entire country but a fraction of the country a substantial fraction there are you can see there 's a sizewell b inside a blue square so by this particular metric nuclear power isn 't as intrusive but the same goes for renewables as well here 's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of penicuik just and you can see the children of penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill so people are anti everything and we 've got to keep all the options on the table what can a country like the and recognizing that they need to be close to country sized other people 's renewables so we could go back and talk very politely to the people in the top left hand side of the diagram and say uh we don 't want renewables in our backyard but um please could we put them in yours instead and that 's a serious option it 's a way for the world to kazakhstan could be our best friends for renewable production so that 's some supply side options in addition to the supply levers that we can push and remember we need large amounts because at the moment we get ninety percent of our energy from fossil fuels in addition to those levers and that means reducing population i 'm not sure how to do that so let 's talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side first transport here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport people often say technology can answer everything we can make vehicles that are one hundred times more efficient and that 's almost true let me show you the energy consumption of this typical tank here is eighty kilowatt hours per hundred person kilometers that 's the average european car eighty kilowatt hours can we make something one hundred times better by applying the physics principles i just listed yes here it is it 's eighty times better in energy consumption and it 's powered by biofuel by weetabix and there are other options in between because maybe the lady in the tank would say no that 's a lifestyle change don 't change my lifestyle please we could persuade her to take a train still a lot more efficient than a car but that might be a lifestyle change or there 's the it comfortably accommodates one teenager and it 's 's shorter than a traffic cone and it 's almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at in between perhaps some more realistic options on the transport lever are electric vehicles so electric bikes and electric cars in the middle perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol powered tank there 's the heating lever heating is a third of our energy consumption it 's my house with a ferrari out front which describe how the power the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control the i 've tried it it works some people call it a lifestyle change laughter you can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness of your building put fluff in the walls fluff in the roof a new front door and so forth the sad truth is this will save you money that 's not sad that 's good but the sad truth is it 'll only get about twenty five percent of the leakiness of your building if you do these things which are good ideas if you really want to get a bit closer to swedish building standards with a crappy house like this you need to be putting external insulation on the building as shown by this block of flats in london you can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps which use a smaller bit of high grade energy like electricity read your meters and if you 're anything like me it 'll change your life here 's a graph i made i was writing a book about sustainable energy and a friend asked me how much energy do you use at home and so i started reading the meter every week the old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph and then two thousand and seven is shown in green at the bottom and my life changed because i started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference my gas consumption plummeted because i started tinkering with the thermostat and i knocked more than half off my gas bills there 's a similar story for my electricity consumption and just switching them on when i needed them knocked another third off my electricity bills too we need please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers so i 'm a strong advocate of advocate of having grown up conversations that are based on numbers and and i want to close with this map that just visualizes for you the today our total energy consumption is one hundred and twenty five lightbulbs ' worth if you wanted sixteen from wind this map visualizes a solution for the uk it 's got one hundred and sixty wind farms each one hundred square and that would be a twentyfold increase over today 's amount of wind you 'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map that 's a fourfold increase either in our country or in someone else 's country possibly ireland possibly somewhere else concentrating solar power in other people 's deserts if you wanted to get sixteen lightbulbs ' worth then we 're talking about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right the total area of those hexagons is two greater london 's power lines all the way across spain and france to bring the power from the sahara and thank you very much for listening"
