  "transcript": "and everything i do professionally my life has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in i look young but i 'm not algeria somalia in projects of technical cooperation with african countries i worked for an italian ngo and every single instead everything we touched we killed ripples from the zambezi was a project where we italians so we arrived there with italian seeds in southern zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going going down to the zambezi river and we taught the local people how to grow italian tomatoes and zucchini and and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that so we paid them to come and work and sometimes they would show up and we were amazed that the local people in such a fertile valley would not have any agriculture but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything we simply said thank god we just in the nick of time to save the zambian people from starvation and of course in zambia to this size and we could not believe and we were telling the zambians look how easy agriculture is when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red overnight some two hundred hippos came out from the river and they ate everything and we said to the zambians the hippos and the zambians said yes that 's why we have no agriculture here you should you should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting african people you want to read the book read dead aid by dambisa moyo zambian woman economist the book was published in two thousand and nine we western donor countries have given the african continent in the last fifty years i 'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done just go and read her book we western people we either patronize them the two words come from the latin root pater which means father but they mean two different things i treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children i love you so much i treat everybody from another i was given a slap in the face reading a book small is beautiful written by schumacher above all in economic development if people do not wish to be helped leave them alone this should be the first principle of aid the first principle of aid is respect the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor and said can we can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial i decided when i was to only respond to people and i invented a system you never motivate anybody the servant of local people who have to become a better person so what you do and you sit we have zero infrastructure and we find out what that person wants to do what are you going to do the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most because nobody in the world can succeed alone but the knowledge is available i had this idea why don 't we for once instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do why don 't for once listen to them let me tell you a secret there is a problem with community meetings entrepreneurs never come what they want to do with their own so planning because they don 't come to your public meetings you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist you have to create a new profession the profession is the family doctor of enterprise the family doctor of business who sits with you in your house at your kitchen table at the i started this as a tryout in a ph d at the time trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do and so what i did in esperance that that first year was to just walk the streets and and i helped him to sell to the restaurant in perth to get organized and then the fishermen came to me to say you the guy who helped maori can you help us and i helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to and the farmers came to talk to me said hey you helped them can you help us projects going on and the government came to see me to say how can you we 've done it in three hundred communities around the world we have helped to start forty thousand businesses peter drucker one of the greatest management consultants peter drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business and this is what with an entrepreneurial society and economy planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship so now you 're rebuilding christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy you have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you in a community of ten thousand people we get two hundred clients can you imagine a community of four hundred thousand people the intelligence and the passion so what i 'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it 's at we are at the end of the first industrial revolution the internal combustion engine is not sustainable freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable what we have to look at is at how we the technologies do not exist to do that who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution forget about it forget about it it will be entrepreneurs and they 're doing it now there 's a lovely story that i read there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of new york in one thousand eight hundred and sixty and in one thousand eight hundred because they looked at the curve and if the population keeps growing at this rate to move the population of new york around they would have needed six million horses and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with they were already drowning in manure so one thousand eight hundred and sixty they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of new york so what happens in forty years ' time in the year one thousand nine hundred in the united states of america there were one thousand and one car manufacturing companies one thousand and one and there were tiny however there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs first you have to offer them otherwise they don 't come and talk to you then you have to and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship and you have to have tremendous financial management guess what we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it sell it and look after the money it doesn 't exist and we have looked at the one hundred iconic companies of the world none were started by one person now we teach entrepreneurship and the task of the to underline in the first two pages of richard branson 's autobiography how many times richard uses the word i and how many times he uses the word we never the word i and the word we thirty two times he wasn 't alone when he started nobody started a company alone so we can create the community and your dedicated buddies who will do to you what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic somebody who will say to you okay can you sell it can you look after the money oh no i cannot do this would you like me to find you somebody we activate communities we have groups of volunteers supporting the enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion the energy and imagination of your own people"
