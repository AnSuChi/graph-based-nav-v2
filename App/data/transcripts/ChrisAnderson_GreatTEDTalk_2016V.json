  "transcript": "some people think that there 's a ted talk formula give a talk on a round red rug share a childhood story divulge a personal secret end with an inspiring call to action that 's not how to think of a ted talk in fact if you overuse those devices you 're just going to come across as and i would like to share that thing with you i 've had a ringside seat listening to many hundreds of amazing ted speakers like these i 've helped them prepare their talks for prime time and learned directly and it 's this your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners ' minds an extraordinary gift a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea she 's terrified presenter haley van dyck over the course of eighteen minutes one thousand two hundred people many of whom have never seen each other before are finding that their brains are starting to sync with haley 's brain and with each other they 're literally beginning to exhibit the same let 's take a look inside haley 's brain for a moment there are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle but look here right here a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single and incredibly this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening that 's right in just a few minutes a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into one thousand two hundred minds just by people listening to a voice and watching a face but wait what is an idea anyway well you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world ideas come in all shapes and sizes from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic here are just a few examples shared from the ted stage and we should treat it with the same status it 's elegant it 's earthquake resistant ca chimamanda adichie people are more than a single identity chimamanda adichie and the problem but that they are incomplete ca your mind is teeming with ideas and not just randomly and it is built up out of millions of individual ideas then when you see this you but if another component of you need them to be as reliable as possible a guide to the scary but wonderful real world out there different people 's worldviews can be dramatically different for example how does your worldview react when you see this image dalia mogahed what do you think when you look at me a woman of faith they 're capable of changing forever how someone thinks about the world and shaping their actions both now and well into the future so if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you 're most passionate about you have to give context share examples make it vivid so pick so that everything you say links back to it in some way two give your listeners a reason to care you have to get their permission to welcome you in and the main tool to achieve that use provocative questions to identify why something doesn 't make sense and needs explaining piece by piece out of concepts that your you use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners ' minds you start where they are the speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences for example when jennifer kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called crispr she said it 's as if for the first time you had a word processor to edit dna crispr allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily it 's important therefore to test your talk on trusted friends and find out which parts they get confused by"
