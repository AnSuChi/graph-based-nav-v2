  "transcript": "always to find ways to to chronicle to share and to document stories about people just everyday people stories that offer transformation because because that 's really the moment we really know what we 're made of i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation in the ' 80s of students who were protesting a military dictatorship which has finally ended but what i 've come to learn but in the simple everyday acts of compassion in south africa they have a phrase called ubuntu i don 't really see it i don 't pay attention to it until there 's you know like a bug that 's dead on the window then suddenly i see it and usually it 's never good it 's usually when i 'm cussing in traffic at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes so what ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people it 's really very simple but really very complicated so i thought i should start with some stories i should tell you some stories about remarkable people so i thought i 'd start with my mother laughter and she was dark too my mother was english my parents met in oxford in the ' 50s and my mother moved to nigeria and lived there she was five foot two very feisty and very english this is how english my mother is or was she just passed she came out to california to los angeles to visit me and we went to malibu which and he came up and my mother said do you have any specials young man and chad says sure like we have this like salmon that 's like rolled in this like wasabi like crust it 's totally rad and my mother turned to me and said what language is he speaking americans we gave them a language why don 't they use it so this woman who converted from the church of england to catholicism when she married my father and there 's no one more rabid than a catholic convert decided to teach particularly among igbo women the billings ovulation method which was the only approved birth control by the catholic church but so she took me along to translate i was seven so here are these women who never discuss their period never would have thought of herself as a feminist my mother but she always used to say anything a man can do i can fix when my father complained about this situation where she 's taking a seven year old boy to teach this birth control you know he used to say oh you 're turning him into you 're teaching him how to be a woman my mother said someone has to this woman we were caught in the war it was my mother with five little children it takes her one year through refugee camp after refugee camp to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country and make him a boy soldier can standing up to men with guns who want to kill us all through that one year in the airport about to fly to england this woman saw my mother wearing this dress which had been washed so many times it was basically see through and she told this woman and so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to mother and to us and the toys of her kids who didn 't like that very much but that was the only time she cried and i remember years later i was writing about my mother and i asked her why did you cry then and she said you know you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you and they would sing these dirges made up of these names dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you and they would sing them only when they planted the rice as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead they would sing these joyful songs that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year and then the next planting season when they sang the dirge they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were and in this way these women enacted did you know that before the genocide in rwanda the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one did you also know that after apartheid when the new government went into the parliament houses there were no female toilets in the building which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men all of this to say that despite the horror and despite the death women are never really counted their humanity never seems to matter very much to us when the igbo part of the country where i 'm from there were always rites of passage for young men men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women that 's essentially what it is and a lot of rituals involved killing killing little animals progressing along so when i turned thirteen and i mean it made sense it was an agrarian community somebody to kill the animals there was no whole foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at so when i turned thirteen it was my turn now to kill a goat and but i had to do it and i was supposed to do this alone but a friend of mine called emmanuel who was significantly older than me who 'd been a boy soldier during the biafran war decided to come with me sort of and their intestines would fall out but they would keep running so this guy comes with me and i don 't know if you 've ever heard a goat or seen one they sound like human beings that 's why we call tragedies a song of a goat my friend brad kessler says that we didn 't become human until we started keeping goats so when i tried to kill this goat and i couldn 't so i don 't have to look into them while i kill the goat it didn like a lot for i was a wimp i cried and afterwards he didn 't say a word he just sat there watching me cry for an hour you will die of heartbreak just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult of course talking about goats makes me think of sheep and not in good ways so so growing up you know i had a cake and everything but i never got any presents because born two days after christmas so and we had the catholic priest over my mother was entertaining him with tea and my uncle suddenly says where and my mother said don 't talk about that in front of guests but he was desperate to show that he 'd just come back so he summoned me up and he said go into the bedroom my bedroom it 's your birthday present i but i found an inflatable sheep so i blew it up and ran into the living room my finger where it shouldn 't have been was waving this buzzing sheep around and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock i 'm scottish the last eighteen months my cellmate the first year of the last eighteen months and in those days if a the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in and he had smuggled in two comics two comic books spiderman and x men he was obsessed and and so reciting take that spidey i heard it on the grapevine they killed him and they tacked his penis to a table with a six inch nail then left him there to bleed to death because i let my feelings be known the igbo used to say and they would express a wish and their wish would then be brought to a priest but if the god the igbos would destroy the god they would knock down the shrine and they would stop saying the god 's name this is how they came to reclaim their humanity all of us here we 're building gods that have gone rampant and it 's time we started knocking them down it doesn 't require a tremendous thing all it requires is to recognize among us every day the few of us that can see are surrounded by people like the ones i 've told you"
