  "transcript": "maybe gmo is the problem too much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans they go on and on so how do we bring that how is this apple food crisis you 've all eaten an apple in the last week two weeks two months we pick them we put them in cold storage we gas the cold storage there 's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple and dying how is it that none of you knew this why didn 't i know this ninety percent of the quality of that apple all of the antioxidants are gone by the time we get it how did we get so information poor i think what 's missing is a platform i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young i did very weird things if we had a platform we might feel empowered to question what if for me i questioned what if what would that change about quality of life and nutrition what if what if you could take this apple digitize it somehow send it through particles in the air what if no water no land and no future what i landed to the day that i went to minamisanriku one stop south of fukushima after the disaster the land is contaminated they already import seventy percent of their own food but it 's not unique two percent of the american population is involved in farming what good answer comes from two percent of any population eighty percent don 't want to be farmers farming is hard the life of a small shareholder farmer farmers ' families not being able to have basic access to utilities more farmer suicides this year and the previous ten this is my combine a number of years ago now i went to bed bath and beyond and home depot and i started hacking and i built silly things and i made plants dance and i attached them my computer and i killed them all a lot laughter i eventually got them to survive and i created one of the most intimate relationships i 've ever had in my life because i was learning here 's an old electronics room that what can you do with my team we built a farm inside of the media lab a place historically known not for anything about biology but everything about digital life we produced enough food to feed about three hundred people once a month not a lot of food and there 's a lot of interesting technology in there but the most interesting thing beautiful and a monthly harvest is this a new cafeteria is this a new this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything we get our salad in bags but what happens when you have an image based processing expert a data scientist ripping roots off and thinking huh i know something about i could make this happen i want to try in that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab because if you grew it you don 't throw it away it 's kind of precious to you i have this weird tongue now because i 'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until i 've eaten it first i want it to be good so i eat lettuce every day and i can tell the ph of a lettuce within 1 i 'm like no that 's six point one no no you can 't eat it today this lettuce that day was hyper sweet it was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself i 'm not going to die and the plants so we thought other people needed to be able to try this we want to see what people can create so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere and then we built it if you know about the genome or this is the phenome right the phenomena when you say i like the strawberries from mexico you really like the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression so if you 're coding climate this much co2 this much o2 creates a recipe you 're coding the expression of that plant the nutrition of that plant the size of that plant the shape the color so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what 's going on if you think of your houseplants and you look at your houseplant and you 're super sad because you 're like why are you dying won 't you talk to me farmers develop the most beautiful fortune telling eyes by the time they 're in their late 60s and 70s they can tell you when you see that plant dying that it 's a nitrogen deficiency a calcium deficiency or it needs more humidity beautiful eyes are not being passed down these are eyes in the cloud of a farmer we trend those data points over time we correlate those data points to individual plants these are all the broccoli in my lab that day by ip address if that 's not weird enough you can click one when does it achieve the nutrition that i need when does it achieve the taste that i desire it 's conversant we have a language right that 's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends and i mean it it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen more phosphorus we 're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now and they may not friend us back i don 't know they might friend us back it depends on how we act so it 's a little bit more systematized my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things so and so we 're experimenting with all kinds of things minerals and oxygen roots are not that complicated so when you give them that grows four or five times faster it 's a perfect world we 've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world and we 're going to continue to do that but we 're going to have a new tool too so we 've grown all kinds of things these tomatoes hadn 't been in commercial production for one hundred and fifty years do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks it 's amazing alive and things that you 've never eaten i am the only person in this room that 's eaten that kind of tomato problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don 't know how to cook so we ate a sauce tomato which is not that great but we 've grown humans well maybe you could but we didn 't but what we realized is the tool was too big it was too expensive i was starting to put them around the world and they were about one hundred thousand dollars finding somebody with one hundred grand in their back isn 't easy so we wanted to make a small one camille we iterated all summer how to make it cheaper how to make it work better how to make it so other people can make it then we dropped them off in schools seventh through eleventh grade and if you want and he says oh why didn 't you just tell me that they have a 3d environment they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smartphone on their tablet they can download then all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do was it was it better or was it worse imagine these as little cores of we 're going to learn so much here 's one of the food computers as we call them in a school in three weeks ' time this is three weeks of growth but more importantly it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer or that he would want to be a it 's very important to me that this is easily accessible we 're going to keep making it more so urban planners on one platform doing what they 're good at but we got a little too big this is my new facility that i 'm just starting this warehouse could be anywhere that 's why i chose it and inside of this warehouse we 're going to build something kind of like this these exist right now take a look at it pretty amazing that plants and this darpa grand challenge winner is one of the reasons we 're getting ahead of ebola the plants are producing the protein so pharmaceuticals nutraceuticals all they way down to lettuce but these two things look nothing alike and that 's where i am with my field everything is different we 're in that weird we 're alright no i 've got intellectual property that 's totally valuable don 't buy his buy mine and the reality is we 're just at the beginning in a time when society is shifting too when we ask for more cheaper food we 're now asking for environmentally friendly food and when you have mcdonald 's advertising what 's in the chicken mcnugget the most mysterious food item of all time they are now basing their marketing plan on that everything is changing personal food computers food servers and food data centers run on actuate and grow what does this look like in a world you remember this is where we 're already deploying the future of food is not about fighting over what 's wrong with this the future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question"
