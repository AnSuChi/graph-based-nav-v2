  "transcript": "i was born with so i 've never seen color and i don 't know what color looks like because i come from a grayscale world to me the sky is always gray but since the age of instead of seeing color i can hear color and the result with further collaborations with from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona is this it 's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me and i hear the color in front of me through the bone through bone conduction i 've been hearing color all the time for eight so i find it completely normal now to hear color all the time but after some time all this information became a perception and after some time this perception became a feeling i started to have favorite colors and i started to dream in colors so it was my brain creating electronic sounds it wasn 't the software so an extension of my it even became a part of my official image but i insisted to the passport office that an extension of my brain and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport because color is almost everywhere so the biggest change for example is i can listen to a picasso for example so it 's like i 'm going to a concert hall because i can listen to the paintings and supermarkets i find this is very shocking it 's very very attractive to walk along a supermarket it 's like going to a nightclub it 's full of different melodies especially the aisle with cleaning products it 's just fabulous laughter also the way i dress has changed before i used to dress in a way that it looked good now i dress in a way that it sounds good so it 's quite a happy chord if i had to go to a funeral though i would dress in b minor which would be purple and orange laughter also food so i can eat my favorite song so depending on how i lady gaga salads as starters i mean and some bjork or madonna desserts that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs also the way i perceive beauty has changed because when i look at someone i hear their face so the other way around so i really enjoy creating like sound portraits of people instead of drawing someone 's face like drawing the shape i point at them with the eye and i write down the different notes i hear and then i create sound portraits here 's some faces and you can actually also create concerts it 's not my fault so another thing that happens is that i started having this secondary effect i heard a and it it felt green because it sounded just like the color green the bbc beeps so i started to and here 's some mozart queen of the night looks like this very yellow and very colorful because there 's many different frequencies very pink and very yellow so also voices i can transform these are two very one of them is martin luther king 's i have a dream and the other one is hitler and i like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels and then i ask people which one do you prefer and most people change their preference when i tell them that the one on the left is hitler vision i was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel but then i just but that electronic eyes can perceive so and i added hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive for example perceiving infrared is good because you can actually and because ultraviolet is a dangerous color i created the cyborg foundation which is a foundation that we should all think that knowledge comes from our senses so if we extend our senses we will consequently extend our knowledge i think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body i think this will so i do encourage you all to think about i would encourage you to become a cyborg you won 't be alone thank"
