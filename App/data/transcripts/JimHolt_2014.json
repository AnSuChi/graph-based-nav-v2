  "transcript": "why is there a world why are we in it and why is there something rather than nothing at all i mean this is the super ultimate where we are now in addressing it and i hope you do care the philosopher arthur schopenhauer said that that 's a little harsh but still it 's obsessed ludwig wittgenstein perhaps the greatest philosopher of the 20th century epigrams from the teacher of richard feynman the coiner of the term black hole he said i want to know how come the quantum how come the universe how come existence and my friend martin amis sorry that i 'll be doing a lot of name dropping in this talk so get used to it my dear friend martin amis once said that we 're about five einsteins away from answering the mystery of where the universe came from and i 've no doubt there are five einsteins in the audience tonight why is there something rather than nothing this sublime question was posed rather late in leibniz who this was not a great mystery he either was or and god created indeed out of nothing at all that 's how powerful god is he doesn 't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of he can make it out of sheer nothingness creation and by the way this is what most americans today believe there is no mystery of existence for them god made it so let 's put this in an equation so use your imaginations so it 's and so maybe don 't believe in god maybe you 're a scientific atheist or or an unscientific atheist and you don 't believe in god + nothing = the world there 's already a problem why does god exist so i 'm eternal i 'm all powerful but where did i come from whence then am i god speaks in a more formal english but anyway let 's forget about god okay and to a buddhist the world is just a whole lot of nothing it 's just a big and we think there 's a lot of something out there but that 's because we 're enslaved by our desires if we let our desires melt away thinking but i 'm a westerner and i 'm still concerned concerned with the puzzle of existence so i 've got and the most fundamental science is physics taufotu the true and ultimate furniture of the universe so maybe physics have purported to give a purely scientific explanation of how a stephen hawking is one of these physicists more recently and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine lawrence krauss who wrote a book called a universe from nothing and lawrence thinks that he 's given a little and then by the miracle of okay this is a really ingenious and the problem is this but he 's still in thrall to a religious worldview he sees physical laws as being like divine commands the laws of quantum field theory for him are like fiat lux let there be light the laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss that it 's pregnant with being they can call a world into existence but that 's a very primitive view of what a physical we know that physical laws are actually and if you don 't believe me on this listen to stephen hawking who himself put forward a model of the cosmos that was any outside cause any creator and after proposing this hawking admitted that he was still puzzled this model is just equations what breathes fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe he was puzzled by this so even if the laws why not a completely different set of laws there are many many mathematically consistent sets of laws believe it or not that reflective physicists really think a lot about and at this point they tend to go metaphysical say but maybe every consistent set of laws describes another part of reality and in fact all possible physical worlds really exist they 're all out there we just see a little tiny part of reality that 's described by the laws of quantum field theory but there are many many other worlds parts of reality that are described by vastly different theories that are different from ours in ways we can 't imagine that are the father of the standard model of particle physics has actually flirted with this idea himself that all possible realities actually younger physicist max tegmark who believes that and mathematical existence is the same thing as physical existence so we have this now in taking this metaphysical way out these physicists and also philosophers are actually reaching back to a very old idea that goes back to plato it 's the principle of plenitude or fecundity or the great chain of being that reality is actually as full as possible it 's as far removed from nothingness as it could possibly be so we have these two extremes now we have sheer nothingness on one side and we have this vision of a reality that encompasses every conceivable world at the other extreme the fullest possible now what 's in between these two extremes so one of these intermediate realities is the most mathematically elegant reality that leaves out the and he has written a book called the elegant universe he claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant but i think the other day he admitted to me it 's really an ugly universe constructed it 's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles and what the hell is dark energy it 's a stick and bubble gum contraption it 's not an elegant universe and then there 's the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense you should get solemn now because a world in which sentient beings don 't suffer needlessly in which there aren 't things like various special realities nothingness is special it 's the simplest but what are we leaving out here but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness they 're a mixture of chaos and order of mathematical elegance and i would describe these realities as an mediocre incomplete mess a generic reality a kind of cosmic junk shot and these realities maybe but the deity isn 't perfect like the pretty much describes the the world we see around us i think so i would like to propose that the resolution to the mystery of existence is that that it can either turn out to be nothing or everything or something in between that would require an explanation and indeed i would say that 's the reality we live in that 's what science is telling us arbitrary pointless reality it 's like a big frothing champagne coming out out of a bottle endlessly mostly a wasteland with little pockets of charm and order and peace this has been confirmed this inflationary scenario by the observations made by radio telescopes in antarctica that looked at the signature of the gravitational why should you care why do you exist you know our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable because back of the envelope calculation will tell you there are about ten to the what if we were living in the most elegant possible reality imagine imagine the existential pressure on us to live up to that to be elegant not to pull down the tone of it well then our existence would be guaranteed because every possible thing if i really struggle morally and agonize and i decide to do the right thing what difference does it make because there are an infinite number of versions of me also doing the right thing and an infinite number doing the wrong thing so my choices are meaningless and as for the special reality of nothingness we wouldn 't be having this conversation so i think there are nasty bits and nice bits and we could make the nice bits bigger and the nasty bits smaller and that gives us a kind of purpose in life the universe is absurd but we can still construct a purpose and that 's a pretty good one and the overall mediocrity of reality kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity we all feel in the core of our being and i know you feel it i know you 're all special but you 're still kind of secretly mediocre and you 're in good company bertrand russell said and my professor at columbia sidney morgenbesser a great philosophical wag when i said to him professor morgenbesser why is there something rather than nothing even if there was nothing you still wouldn 't be satisfied"
