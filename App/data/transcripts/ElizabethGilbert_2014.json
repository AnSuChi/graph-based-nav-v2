  "transcript": "a few years ago i was at jfk airport about to get on a flight when i was approached by two women who i do not think would be insulted to hear themselves described as tiny old up to me and she goes honey i gotta ask you something you got something to do with that whole ' eat pray love ' thing that 's been going on lately and i said yes i did and she smacks her friend and she goes see i told you i said that 's that girl that 's that girl who wrote that book based on that movie so that 's who i am to be that person because that whole eat pray love thing was a huge break for me but it also left me in a really tricky position moving forward as an author trying to figure out how in the world i was ever going to write a book again that would ever please anybody because i knew well in advance that all of those people who had adored eat pray love were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever i wrote next because it wasn 't going to be so i knew that i had no way to win but if i had done that if i had given up writing i would have lost my beloved vocation so i knew that the task was that i had to find some way to gin up the inspiration to write the next book regardless of its inevitable negative outcome and i did in the end find that inspiration but i found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place i found it in lessons that i had learned earlier in life about how creativity can survive its own failure so just to back up and explain the only thing i have ever wanted to be for my whole life was a writer i wrote all through childhood all through adolescence by the time i was a teenager i was sending my very bad stories to the new yorker hoping to be discovered after college i got a job as a diner waitress kept working kept writing kept trying really hard to get published and failing at it i failed at getting published for almost six years so for almost six years every single day i had nothing but rejection letters waiting for me in my mailbox and it was devastating every single time and every single time i had to ask myself i 'm going home and you have to understand that for going home meant returning to the work of writing because writing was my home because i loved writing more than i hated failing at writing which is to say that i loved writing more than i loved my own ego which is ultimately to say that i loved writing more than i loved myself thinking about her constantly and feeling like i was her again which made no rational sense whatsoever because our lives could not have been more different she had failed constantly i had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation we had nothing in common why did i suddenly feel like i was her all over again and it was only when i was trying to unthread that that i finally began to comprehend the strange and unlikely psychological connection in our lives between the way we experience great failure and but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here into the blinding darkness of disappointment success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far way out over here into the equally blinding glare of fame and recognition but your subconscious is completely incapable of discerning the difference between bad and good the only thing that it is capable of feeling is the absolute value of this emotional equation the exact distance that you have been but in both cases it turns out that there is also the same remedy for self restoration and that is that you have got to find your way back home again as swiftly and smoothly as you can i don 't know your home is that thing to which you can dedicate your energies with such singular devotion that the ultimate results become inconsequential so after the weird disorienting success that i went through with eat pray love i realized that all i had to do was exactly the same thing that i used to have to do all the time when i was an equally disoriented failure i had to get my ass back to work and i was fine actually i kind of felt bulletproof because i knew that i had broken the spell and i had found my way back home to writing for the sheer devotion of it and i stayed in my home of writing after that and i wrote another book that just came out last year and that one was really beautifully received which is very nice but not my point my point is that i 'm writing another one now and i 'll write another book after that and another and another and another and many of them will fail and some of them might succeed but i will always be safe from the random hurricanes of outcome as long as i never forget where i rightfully live love more than you love yourself to find your way back"
