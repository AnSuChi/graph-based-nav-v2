  "transcript": "i was seventeen and going on a peace walk what i didn 't know though was most of those people standing there with me were moonies and within a week i had come to believe that the second coming of christ had occurred that it was sun myung moon and that i had been specially chosen and prepared by god now as cool as that sounds my family was not that thrilled with this and after and i then became a deprogrammer i started going out on cases and after about five years i was arrested for kidnapping most of the cases i went out on and so they took them and so after and about twenty years went by and so i decided to write a book a memoir about this decade of my life and it had a chilling effect on me women gave poison to their babies and watched foam come from their mouths as they died the top picture is a group of moonies that have been blessed by their messiah their mates were chosen for them the bottom picture is hitler youth this is the leg of a suicide bomber the thing i had to admit to myself with great repulsion was that i get it i understand how this could happen i understand how someone 's brain how someone 's mind can come to the place when your brain is working like that not to try to save the world through genocide and how i 've come to view what happened to me is a viral memetic infection for those of you who aren 't familiar with memetics a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves much like a virus the way a virus works is it can infect and do the most damage to someone i was naive i was pretty lost in my world i was really idealistic these easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable what happens is that circular logic takes over moon is one with god god is going to fix all the problems in the world because after all god and the thing is though if you looked at my brain during those years in the moonies neuroscience is expanding exponentially as ray kurzweil said yesterday science is expanding we 're beginning to look inside the brain and so if you looked at my brain or any brain that 's infected with a viral memetic infection like this and compared it to anyone in this room or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular i am convinced it would look very very different"
