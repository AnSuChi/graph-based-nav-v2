  "transcript": "have you ever heard the one about how breastfeeding is free because it 's only free if we don 't value women 's time and energy any mother can tell you how much time and energy it takes to liquify her body to literally dissolve herself as she feeds this precious little cannibal milk is why mammals suck at arizona state university in the comparative i decode mothers ' milk composition to understand its complexity the most important thing that i 've learned is that we do not do enough and when we fail mothers and babies we fail everyone who loves mothers and the fathers the partners the grandparents the aunties the friends and kin that make our human social networks it 's time that we abandon simple solutions and simple slogans and grapple with the nuance i was very fortunate to run smack dab into that nuance very early during my first interview with a journalist when she asked me how long should a mother breastfeed her baby and it was that word should that brought me up because i will never tell a woman what she should do with her body babies survive and thrive because their mother 's milk is food medicine and signal mother 's milk is a complete diet that provides all the building blocks for their bodies that shapes their brain and fuels all of their activity mother 's milk also feeds the microbes that are colonizing the infant 's intestinal tract milk provides immunofactors that help fight pathogens and mother 's milk provides hormones that signal to packaged powdered flavored and formulated we abandoned the milk of human kindness and turned our priorities elsewhere at the national institutes of in washington dc is the national library of medicine which contains twenty five million articles the brain trust of life science and biomedical research but far fewer about breast milk and lactation wine and tomatoes we know over twice as much about erectile dysfunction i 'm not saying we shouldn 't know about those things i 'm a scientist i think we should know about everything we know so much less globally nine out of ten women will have at least one child in her lifetime that means that nearly one hundred and thirty million babies are born each year these mothers and babies deserve our best science recent research has shown that milk doesn 't just grow the body it fuels behavior and shapes in two thousand and fifteen researchers discovered that the mixture of breast milk and baby saliva specifically baby saliva causes a chemical reaction that produces hydrogen peroxide that can kill staph and salmonella and from humans and other mammal species we 're starting to understand that the biological recipe of milk can be different when produced for sons or daughters when we reach for donor milk in the neonatal intensive care unit or formula on the store shelf it 's nearly and that milk may be a part of that mothers have gotten the message and the vast majority of mothers intend to breastfeed but many do not reach their breastfeeding goals endocrine disorders c section and preterm births all can disrupt the underlying biology of lactation and many women do not have knowledgeable clinical support twenty five years ago the world health organization and unicef established criteria for hospitals to be considered baby friendly that provide the optimal level of support for mother infant bonding and infant feeding today only one in five babies in the united states is born in a baby friendly hospital this is a problem because mothers can grapple with many days and weeks of lactation they can have struggles with establishing latch with pain with milk letdown and perceptions of milk supply these mothers deserve knowledgeable clinical staff that understand these processes mothers will call me as they 're grappling with these struggles with wobbly voices it 's not working this is what i 'm supposed to naturally be able to do why is it not working and just because something is evolutionarily ancient doesn 't mean that it 's easy or that we 're instantly good at it you know what else is evolutionarily ancient nobody expects us to start out being good at it clinicians best deliver quality equitable care when they have continuing education and in order to have that continuing education we need to anchor it in both the life sciences and the social sciences because we need to recognize that too often historical traumas and implicit biases sit in the space between a new mother and her clinician the body is political if our breastfeeding support is not intersectional it 's not good and for moms who have to return for work because countries like the united states do not provide paid parental leave they can have to go back in as short as just a few days after giving birth how do we optimize mother and infant health just by messaging about breast milk to moms without providing the institutional support that facilitates we can 't legislators and the voters who elect them and shareholders and we all have a role to play in achieving it breast milk is a part of improving human health in the nicu when infants are born early or sick or injured milk or bioactive constituents in milk can be critically important environments or ecologies or communities where there 's high risk of infectious disease where there are emergencies like storms the smallest drops but understanding breast milk is not just about messaging to mothers and policy makers it 's also about understanding what is important in breast milk so that we can deliver as women around the world struggle to achieve it 's time"
