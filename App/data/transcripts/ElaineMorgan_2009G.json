  "transcript": "eminent evolutionists anxious to celebrate this and what they 're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of darwin and his life and how he changed our thinking and they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something so i 'm going to talk about it it 's the question of why are we so different from the chimpanzees we get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related hardly any genes of difference very very closely related when you look at the phenotypes there 's a chimp there 's a man they 're astoundingly different i mean laughter if i 'm a good darwinist i 've got to believe there 's a reason for that if we changed so much what happened the ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees that explained everything we had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass or to chase after animals or to free our hands for weapons and we got so overheated in the chase the paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and then they were so clever they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen the fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation some of it even came from lianas those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle so we 're left with a situation where before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence professor tobias came over from south africa we 've got to go back to square one and start again a terrible thing to happen you 've got this beautiful paradigm and now it 's whipped away from under you what do you do what does a scientist do in that case well we know the answer because thomas he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is guess what they carry on as if nothing had happened if they haven 't got a paradigm they can 't ask the question so they say yes it 's wrong but only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions aaron filler from harvard said isn why don 't we talk about well there 's chromosomes and there 's genes and we just record what we see charles darwin must be spinning in his grave and if you 're going to say i 'm going to stop talking about selective pressures you can take the origin of species and throw it out of and the irony of it is that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn 't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up it had been waiting there since one thousand nine hundred and sixty when alister hardy a marine biologist said our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time he kept it to himself for thirty years but then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose all his colleagues said this is outrageous you 've you must never do that again and at that time it became set in stone the aquatic theory should be dumped with the ufos and the well i don 't think that i think that hardy had a lot going for him i 'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind the things that made us different from everybody else and all our relatives let 's look at our naked skin it 's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair mammals without body hair and a couple of and you 're tempted to think well could that be why we are naked i suggested it and people said no no no i mean look at the elephant you 've forgotten all about the elephant haven 't you so back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two i said well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor everybody agrees that the elephant round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors the last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros last year in florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said seems to have spent most of its time in the water so this is a close connection between nakedness and water as an absolute connection it only works one way you can 't say all aquatic animals are naked because look at the sea otter but you can say that every i think this is significant the only exception here you can anybody to compare it with because we but you can say this all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs if they want to for a short time there is only one circumstance in which they always all of them walk on two legs and that is when they are wading through water do you think that 's significant as the possible beginning of our bipedalism look at the fat layer we have got under our skin a layer of fat all over well they do know that if you look at other aquatic land mammals is deposited inside the body wall around the kidneys and the and spread out in a layer inside the skin in the whale it 's complete no fat inside at all all in blubber outside we cannot avoid the suspicion that in case it 's started to happen we have got skin lined with this layer it 's the only possible explanation of why humans if they 're very unlucky physically impossible something very odd matter of factly never explained and the nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath you can 't even train a gorilla to say ah on request the only it was an absolute precondition there is the fact try to imagine a gorilla performing the same and you can see that compared with gorilla we are halfway to being shaped like a fish i am trying to suggest that for aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe and it is not lunatic fringe and the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own which they 've all agreed on and they love there is nothing there they are staving off the how do they react when i say these things one very common reaction i 've heard about twenty times is they conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning when hardy years i 've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind and i 've concluded that that 's one of the urban myths it 's never been done i ask people sometimes but they like and they can 't all be wrong can they loud and clear is yes they can all be wrong history is strewn with the cases when they 've all got it wrong and if you 've got a scientific problem like solve it by holding a head count and saying more of us say yes than say no apart from that some of the heads count more than others sir david attenborough either they will go on for the next forty years fifty years sixty years yeah well we don 't talk about that let 's talk about the second thing that could happen it was this i don 't think there is a third option so the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing if you look back at the early years of the last century lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in mendel and the believers in darwin it ended with a new synthesis and i think the same thing will happen here you 'll get a new synthesis hardy 's ideas and darwin 's ideas will be blended together that would be a beautiful thing it would be very nice for me if it happened soon because i 'm older now than george burns was when he the professional journals let alone look for a reason to it horizon which takes its cue from the academics won 't touch it with a barge pole so we never hear the case put for it except i don 't know quite where this diktat comes from somebody up there is issuing the thou shalt not believe because it will get in your way so i get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are but you know because richard dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood you 've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence he says you must never be afraid to rock the boat"
