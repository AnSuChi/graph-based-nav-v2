  "transcript": "i 've cared for people who live and work in conditions that can be hard if where we live and where we work lives so what does this different approach to healthcare look like an approach that can improve health where it begins 26 patient day she came into our clinic with a chronic headache this headache had been going on for a number of years and this particular episode was the results are normal so here 's some pain medication but if the pain persists or if it worsens then come on back veronica followed those standard instructions and she went back but twice more veronica came to our clinic and despite all these encounters with healthcare professionals veronica was still sick someone who had a ged level training she asked what 's your chief complaint headache let 's get your vital signs measure your blood pressure and your heart rate but let 's also ask something equally as vital to veronica and a lot of patients like her in south los angeles specifically about your housing conditions do you have mold do you have water leaks do you have roaches in your home reviewed it and i turned the handle on the door and i entered the room you should understand that veronica like a lot of patients that i have the privilege of caring for is but here she was doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table a crease in her skin in medicine we call that crease the allergic salute and examining her and listening to her i said veronica i think i have chronic allergies and i think you have migraine headaches and some sinus congestion and i think all of those are related to where you live but i said veronica now let 's talk about your treatment we but i also want to refer you to a specialist if that 's okay now specialists are a little hard to find in south someone who if it 's okay with you can come to your home and try to understand what 's going on with those water leaks and that mold trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that i think are causing your symptoms because it might be that your landlord isn 't making the fixes he 's required to make veronica came back in a few months later she told us that her symptoms had improved by ninety percent veronica had improved remarkably were no longer as sick as they used to be she had gotten better and not coincidentally veronica 's home was better too what was it about this different approach we tried that led to better care fewer visits to the e r better health well quite simply it started with that question veronica where do you live but more importantly it was that we put in place a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions to veronica and hundreds more like her about the conditions that mattered in her community about where health and unfortunately sometimes illness do begin in places like south l a gun violence the important thing is we put in place a system that worked and it 's an approach that i call an upstream approach it comes from a parable that 's very common in the public health community this is a parable of three friends imagine that you 're one of these three friends who come to a river it but it 's shattered by the cries of a child and actually several children in need of rescue in the water so you do hopefully what everybody would do you jump right in along with your friends the first friend says i 'm going to rescue those who are about to drown and they finally look up and they see that their third friend is nowhere to be seen rescuing children and they shout to her where are you going there are children here to save and she says back i 'm going to find out who or what is throwing these children in the water in healthcare we have the trauma surgeon the icu nurse the e r doctors we have those people that are vital we also know that we have the second friend we have that raft builder that 's the primary care clinician but also there to make sure that you have a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety but while that 's also vital and very necessary what we 're missing is that third friend we don 't have enough of that are the health care professionals who know that health does begin where we live and work and play but beyond that awareness is able to mobilize the resources to create the system in their clinics and in their hospitals that really does start to approach that to connect people to the resources they need outside the four walls of the clinic a very obvious question that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask doctors and nurses thinking about transportation and housing rescuing people at the water 's edge is important enough work who scientists now know that the living and working conditions that we all are part of the structures of our environments the ways in which our social fabric is woven together and the impact those have on our behaviors all together those have more than five times the impact on our health than do all the pills and procedures administered by doctors and hospitals combined all together living and working conditions account for sixty percent of preventable death let me give you an example of what this feels like let 's say there was a company a tech startup that came to you and said we have a great product it 's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease but what if that product was a park controlled for a lot of factors and found that when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease one 's exposure to green space was a powerful influence and that stayed true for rich and for poor that study illustrates what my friends in public health often say these days that one 's zip code matters more than your genetic code we genes turned on and off based on the exposures to the environment to where we live and to where we work so it 's clear upstream issues do matter in that follow up visit she said why did none of my doctors ask about my home before i had nearly a dozen blood tests i went back and forth i saw all sorts of people and no one asked about my home the honest answer is that in healthcare we often treat symptoms without addressing the conditions that make you sick in the first place and there are many reasons for that but the big three we don 't pay for that in healthcare we often pay for volume and not value we pay doctors and hospitals usually for the number of services they provide not necessarily on how healthy they make you we don 't know what to tell you it 's not that doctors don 't know these are important issues in a recent survey done in the u s among physicians thousand physicians eighty percent of them actually said that they know that their patients ' upstream problems are as important as their health issues as their medical problems only one in five doctors said they had any sense of confidence to address those issues matters the ability to do something about it in the systems in which we work this is a huge problem right now because it leads them to this next question which is whose responsibility is it and that brings me to that third point that third answer to veronica 's compelling question part of the reason that we have this conundrum is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists in the healthcare system now there are many upstreamists and i 've had the privilege of meeting many of them in los angeles and in other parts of the country and around the world and it 's important to note that upstreamists sometimes are doctors but they need not be social workers it 's not so important what specific degree upstreamists have at the end of their name what 's more important is that they all seem to share the same ability to implement a process that transforms their assistance transforms the way they practice medicine that process is a quite simple process it 's one two and three let 's try to help children who are bouncing in and out of the hospital that second step and they say let 's identify the root cause usually says well let 's look at your genes let 's look at how you 're behaving maybe you 're not eating healthy enough eat healthier it 's a the root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings to the table is to say let 's look at the living and the working conditions and perhaps that 's what we should mobilize our resources to address because that third element that third part of the process is that next critical part of what upstreamists do they mobilize the resources to create a solution both within the clinical system and then by bringing in people from public health let 's bring in to create a solution that makes sense to take those patients who actually have clinical problems and address their root causes together by linking them to the resources you need it the problem is that there 's just not nearly enough of them out there for every twenty to thirty clinicians in the healthcare system in the u s for instance that would mean that we need twenty five thousand upstreamists by the year two thousand and twenty and that 's why a few years ago my colleagues and i said you know what we need to train and make more upstreamists and health begins simply does that we train that we use for our success but the main thing that we 're interested in is making sure that we 're changing we 're trying to make sure that clinicians and therefore their systems that they work in the confidence to address it 's remarkable 'll tell you the most compelling part of what it means to be working with upstreamists to gather them together i hear stories just like veronica 's there are stories out there of veronica and many more like her people who are coming to the healthcare system and getting a glimpse of what it feels like to be part of something that works whether you 're rich or poor or middle class but that there 's something that we can all do to get there but frankly because it 's a better standard of care healthcare systems and payers can start to let 's see if we can discover some patterns in our data can we align the resources to be able to address them medical schools nursing schools all sorts of health professional education programs can help by training the next generation of upstreamists we need many more of them in the healthcare system if we 're truly going to have it be effective to move from a sickcare system to a healthcare system what do we do what do we do as patients we can start by simply going to our doctors and our nurses to our clinics and asking is there something in where i live and where i work that i should be aware of are there barriers to health that i 'm just not aware of and more importantly if there are barriers that i 'm surfacing if i 'm coming to you and i 'm saying i think have a problem with my apartment or at my workplace or i don 't have to transportation or there 's a park that 's way too far so sorry doctor i can 't take your advice to if those problems exist then doctor are you willing to listen and what can we do together to improve my health where it begins if we 're all able to do this work doctors and healthcare systems payers and all of us together we 'll realize something about health health is not just a personal responsibility or phenomenon health is a common good and that what we do for ourselves we also should do for those we can all invest in making sure that we but at the same time work together and show that we can move healthcare upstream we can improve health where it begins"
