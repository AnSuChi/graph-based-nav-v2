  "transcript": "the most complex problems in our time if we are able to dream i discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality i learned this from my grandmother dr ruth tichauer a jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the andes that so part of my education included helping her in remote indigenous communities i cherish those memories because they helped me to understand life outside the city a life during those trips my grandmother used to recite a kipling poem something lost lost and waiting for you go in the coming years i became a medical student one of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind there 's a part of this problem i think i can solve the part of this problem i have spent my life my life working on the problem starts the fetus needs to survive inside the mother depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood at the moment of birth this communication needs to stop if it doesn 't close the baby has a hole in the heart it is caused by prematurity and we know today as you can see in the chart the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude seem desperate to breathe to close the hole major surgery used to be the only solution one night my friend malte were camping in the amazon region the only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch then came a moment of inspiration used the branch as a mold for our first invention the holes in children 's hearts can be closed with it a coil is a piece of wire wrapped but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem in this video we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype in vitro and in vivo studies if it works can save lives we have the opportunity to make a difference we started to see but we live in a place that is twelve thousand feet high and the hole in altitude patients is different because the orifice between the arteries the first coil the search started went back to the drawing we obtained a new device for centuries indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns on looms and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device we take this traditional method of weaving and make a design made by a smart material that records shape it seems this time the weaving allows us to create a seamless device that doesn 't rust because it 's made of as you can see the device enters the body through the natural channels places itself and closes the hole we have this beautiful delivery system that is so simple to use because it works by itself no open surgery was necessary as doctors we fight with diseases that take a long time and effort to heal as you can see the patient is one hundred percent healed from start to finish the whole procedure takes only thirty minutes we are so proud that some of our former patients are part of our team a team thanks to added close interaction with we lost the fear of creating something new but we receive strength from our patients our creativity our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind not because of cost or access so we have to start a foundation with we will give one device for free to make sure that but we need to be everywhere this whole thing began with one impossible idea as will continue it really is left behind"
