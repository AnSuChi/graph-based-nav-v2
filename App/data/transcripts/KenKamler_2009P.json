  "transcript": "heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind and what i 'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation how the will to survive this is so i 'll take you through that and we 'll see what it 's like when someone really twice i went with nasa and we should have listened to them everest is an extreme environment it 's actually a wind chill factor which is lower than a summer day on mars i reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water my down jacket only to discover that the water was already frozen solid that gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit it starts at base camp at seventeen thousand five hundred feet camp one two thousand feet higher camp two another two thousand feet higher up what 's called the western cwm this is a view of base camp and this is what they unloaded for me i had four yak loads of medical supplies which are dumped in a tent and here i am trying to arrange things there were three other expeditions on the mountain an american team a new zealand team and an imax team and after actually two months of preparation we built our camps all the way up the mountain this is a view looking up the icefall the first two thousand feet of the climb up from base and it actually changes every day when you 're in it you 're like a rat in a maze you can 't even see over the top this is near the top of the icefall you want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen that way it 's less likely to tumble down on you these are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at we cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached that some of these things are ten stories deep or more and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we 're the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall and from there we climb up to camp two which is sort of the foreground these are climbers moving up the lhotse face that mountain if you weren 't roped in would be five thousand feet and winds are constantly scouring the face so no snow gets to accumulate what looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit you have maybe twenty four hours to decide if you 're going to go for the summit or not everybody 's on oxygen your supplies are limited and you either have to go up or go down make that decision very quickly this is a picture of rob hall he was the leader of the new zealand team this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i 'll tell you about so the climbers are just waiting hoping that the wind 's going to die down and in fact the wind does die down at night it becomes very calm there 's no wind at all so that 's what happened the climbers got on the southeast ridge this is the view looking at the southeast ridge the summit would be in the foreground you can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow and there were climbers on that summit ridge and you can see i 've got an oxygen mask on i have an oxygen hose connected here you can see on this climber we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack little titanium tanks very lightweight and we 're not carrying much else this is all you 've got you 're very exposed on the summit ridge ok this is a view taken on the summit and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody you 'd wind up just pulling them off with you and you 're going to fall eight thousand feet into nepal if you fall to your right you 're going to fall twelve thousand feet into tibet so it 's probably better to fall into tibet because you 'll live longer but either way you fall for the rest of your life along that summit ridge and while these guys were up there in the storm the storm was so fierce that we had to and the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher two thousand feet higher this is a view taken along the summit ridge at this point in the storm with doug hansen and we heard that rob was ok but doug was too weak to come down he was we also got some bad news in the storm that there were still eighteen other climbers that we weren 't aware of their their condition they were lost there was all the stories were confusing most of them were conflicting we really had no idea what was going on during that storm we were just hunkered down in our tents our two strongest climbers todd burleson and pete athans decided to go up to try to rescue who they could who was a superb climber i expected them to say to rob and just try to save yourself at this point and rob got that message but his his answer was we 're both listening and but they did what they could to stabilize the people the ones that couldn 't so the climbers were coming down along this route this is taken from camp three where i was and they all came by me so i could take a look at them and see what i could do for them which is really not much because camp three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45 degree angle you can barely stand outside the tent it 's really cold it 's twenty four thousand feet the only supplies i had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids so as the climbers came by me i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down the ones that weren 't that lucid or were not that well coordinated i would give an injection of of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain it 's so awkward to work up there that sometimes i even gave the injections right through their clothes it was just too hard to maneuver any other way there was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude he was just beyond rescue and he knew it at that point he asked and rob and his wife had their last conversation they picked the name for their baby and that was the last we ever heard of him we got the victims down to twenty one thousand feet where it was easier for me to treat them this was my medical kit it 's a tackle box filled with medical supplies and this was scene at the lower camp the survivors came in one by one some of them were hypothermic some of them were frostbitten some were both what we did was try to warm them up as best we could put oxygen on them and try to revive them which is difficult to do at twenty one thousand feet when the tent is freezing we got a startling stumbled into the tent but in fact he walked into the tent and said to me hi ken where should i sit and then he said do you accept my health insurance he really said that and then it falls off it 's the last stage just like a scar so as i was taking care of beck he related what had been going on up there he said he had gotten lost in the storm some climbers had come by and looked at him and he heard them say he 's dead so the climbers passed him by and beck lay there for a day a night and another day in the snow snow and then he said to himself i have a family to come back to and the thoughts of his family his kids and his wife generated so that he actually got up after laying in the snow that long a time he got up and found his way back to the camp told me that story very quietly but i was absolutely stunned by it i couldn 't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and i can only try to speculate on how he did it something that could actually measure brain function where you and the brain stem where you have your basic maintenance functions like heartbeat and respiration and imagine lighting up in red this is a pretty evenly distributed scan you have the the middle area where the temporal lobe might showing equal distribution of energy now you go to this one and you see how much more he 's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble and he 's working pretty hard he 's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this ok but he 's collapsed in the you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again he 's beginning to think about his family he 's beginning to have images that are motivating him to to get up he 's this part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus it 's an area in which which is powering his will okay this is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it 's actually going to be a motivating factor he 's going to develop enough energy in that area after a day a night and a day to actually motivate himself to get up and you can see here he 's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe he 's beginning to focus he can concentrate now he 's thinking about what he 's got to do to save himself so this energy has been transmitted up toward the front front of his brain and it 's getting quieter down here but he 's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going he 's not thinking about his he 's getting himself motivated this is the posterior part where his muscles are going to be moving and so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a spect scan on beck during this so here i am taking care of beck at twenty one thousand feet and i felt what i was was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself it just shows you what the power of the mind can do he was critically ill there were other critically ill patients luckily we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys a helicopter came in at twenty one thousand feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history it was able to land on the ice take away beck and the other survivors at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost and we had a memorial service there a and the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who actually to talk to them directly there were five climbers lost here this was scott fischer andy harris doug hansen and one more climber he was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower he was able to use all the power of his mind to to save himself the message will be carried up to the gods and that year beck 's message was answered"
