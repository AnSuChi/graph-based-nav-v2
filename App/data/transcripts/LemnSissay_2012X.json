  "transcript": "having spent and in being an expert i want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right margaret thatcher was my mother laughter let 's not talk about breastfeeding harry potter was a foster child superman was a foster child cinderella was a foster child lisbeth salander the girl with the dragon tattoo was fostered and institutionalized batman was orphaned the boys in michael morpurgo 's friend alem in benjamin zephaniah 's refugee boy luke skywalker cassia in the concubine of shanghai by hong ying celie in in alice walker 's the color purple all of these great fictional characters all of them who were hurt by their condition all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films all of them adopted or orphaned it seems that writers know that the child outside of family reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be that is they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis and why have we not made the connection between between these incredible characters of popular culture and i know famous musicians i know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national adopted or orphaned and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground as if it were somehow kryptonite deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood it is that simple my own mother and i should say this here she same to this country in in the late ' they found themselves pregnant and she sort of she had no idea of the context in which she 'd landed in the 1960s i should give you some context in the 1960s if you were pregnant and you were single you were seen as a you were separated from your family by the state you were separated from your family and placed into the aim to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life to sign the adoption the mother and baby 's homes were often run by nuns the adoption papers were signed a little break of shame for a woman for being a woman a little break so it was a closed shop it 's kind of easy to patronize the past to forego our responsibilities in the present what happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by god and by the state for the big society and she lands months before the enoch powell speech the rivers of blood speech she lands months before the beatles release the white album months before martin luther king was killed it was a summer of love if you were white if you were black it was a summer of hate from oxford it 's her plan you know i have to say this in the houses but the i was a i was norman mark greenwood i tried praying i swear i tried and then i was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of god or it was the voice of the devil and it turns out i 've got the devil inside of me who so anyway two years sort of passed and they had a child of their own and then another two years passed and they had another child of their own and then another time passed and they had another child that they called an accident which i thought was an unusual name so i was starting to take biscuits from the tin without without asking i was starting to stay out a little bit late etc my mom and dad they sat me at a table and i said yeah of course i do because you do my foster mother asked me to go away to think about love and what it is and to read the scriptures and to come back tomorrow and give my most honest and truthful answer so this was an opportunity if they were asking me whether i loved them or not then i mustn 't love them which led me to the miracle of thought that i thought they wanted me to get to i will ask god for forgiveness and and the answer as honest as a sinner could get i mustn 't love you i said to them clearly you 've chosen your path my social worker this strange man who used to visit me i didn 't say goodbye to anybody not my mother my father my sisters my brothers my aunts my uncles my cousins my grandparents nobody on the way to the children 's home i started to ask myself what 's happened to me it 's not that i 'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away when i got to the for the next four five years i was held in four different children 's homes on the third children 's home at fifteen and what i did was i got three tins of paint airfix paint that you use for models red yellow and green the colors of africa you couldn 't see it from the street because the home was surrounded by beech trees for doing this i was incarcerated for a year in an assessment it was a virtual prison for young people they could do anything to me and last size order they i was put in a dormitory with a confirmed nazi sympathizer man who ran it was an ex army officer i was that home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder and this was the preparation that i was being given after seventeen years i have to tell this story i have to tell it because there was no one to put two and two together i slowly became aware that i knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year see that 's what family does i 'm not defining a good family from a bad family i 'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is a mother a father a sister a brother an aunt an uncle a cousin a grandparent it matters to someone and therefore it matters to you understand and i wasn i 'm reporting back i 'm reporting back simply to say that when i left the children 's home i had two things that i wanted to do one was to find my family and the other was to write poetry in creativity i saw light in the imagination i saw the place where anger was an expression in the search for love a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth i 've just got to say it to you all i found all of my family in my adult life i spent all of my adult life finding them and i 've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else"
