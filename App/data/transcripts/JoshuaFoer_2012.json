  "transcript": "imagine yourself standing the material that it 's made out of now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles i need you to actually see this they are pedaling really hard they 're sweaty step over the threshold of your door and appreciate the quality of the light the light cookie monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse it 's a talking horse you can walk past him into your living room in your living room in full imaginative broadband picture britney she is scantily clad she 's dancing on your coffee table and she 's singing hit me baby one more time and out of your oven the scarecrow and the lion from the wizard of oz open your eyes i want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in new york city it 's called the united states memory championship and i had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science i guess that this was going to be like the superbowl of savants widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep they were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers they were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes they were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest and i started talking to a few of the competitors this is a guy called ed cook who had come over from england where he had one of the best trained and i said to him ed when did you realize that you were a savant in fact i have just an average memory everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory we 've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books how come i never heard of this before but somewhat eccentric because i really want to teach britney spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on u s national television it will prove to the world that anybody can do this but maybe you could teach me i mean you 've got to start somewhere right and i met a host of really interesting people this is a guy called e p the worst memory in the world his memory was so bad that he didn 't even remember he had a memory problem which is amazing and he was this incredibly tragic figure but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are at the other end of the spectrum i met this guy this is kim peek he was the basis for dustin hoffman 's character in the movie rain man we spent an afternoon together which was scintillating and i went back and i read a whole host of memory treatises and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff one of the really interesting things that i learned cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today once upon a time people invested in their memories in laboriously furnishing their minds photography the computer the smartphone that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity these technologies have made our modern world possible but they 've also changed us having little need to remember anymore it sometimes seems like we 've forgotten how one of the last places on earth where you still cultivated memory is at this totally singular memory contest it 's actually not that singular there are contests held all over the world and i was fascinated i wanted to know how do these guys do it a do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally anatomically different from the rest of ours the answer was no are they smarter than the rest of us they gave them a bunch of cognitive tests and the answer was not really there was however one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to scanned their brains while they were memorizing they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else of note they were using or they seemed to be using a part of the brain that 's involved in spatial memory and navigation why and there something that the rest of us can learn from this the sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly and then the rest of the field has to play catch up this is my friend ben world memory champion on his desk in front of him are thirty six shuffled packs of playing cards using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered he used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of four thousand one hundred and forty random binary digits and while there are everything all of the techniques that are being used ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding and it 's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the baker baker paradox which goes like this if i tell two people and i say do you remember that word that i told you a while you remember what it was the person who was told his name is baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a baker the name baker doesn 't actually mean anything to you it is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull but the common noun and when we first hear that word we start putting these associational hooks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date the entire art of what is going on in these memory contests and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life is figuring out ways to transform capital b bakers into lower case b bakers and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind one of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back two thousand five hundred years to ancient greece it came to be known as the memory palace the story behind its creation goes like this there was a poet called simonides who was attending a banquet he was actually the hired entertainment because back then if you wanted to throw a really slamming party you didn 't hire and at the moment he does kills everybody inside it doesn 't just kill everybody it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition nobody can where they were sitting the bodies can 't be properly buried it 's one tragedy compounding another closes his eyes and has this realization which is that in his mind 's eye he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting and he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage what simonides figured out at that moment is something that i think we all kind of intuitively know which is that as bad as we are at remembering we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories if i asked you to recount the first ten words of the story that i just told you about simonides chances are you would have a tough time with it but i would wager that if i asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now you would be able to see that the idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind 's eye stinkier this is advice that goes back 2 000 plus years to the earliest latin memory treatises 's say that you 've been invited and you want to do it from memory and you want to do it the way that cicero would have done it if he had been invited to tedxrome two thousand years ago what you might do and you 'd come up with some sort of crazy ridiculous unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook and then you 'd see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell and and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year and you 'd have some friends to help you remember that this is how roman orators memorized their speeches not word for word which is just going to screw you up the phrase in the first place that 's like in the first place of your memory palace and i got really into the problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event sats i mean the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples and i 'm a journalist and i realized if i was going to tell this story i needed to walk in their shoes a little bit and so i started trying to spend fifteen or twenty minutes every morning before i sat down with my new york times just trying to remember something maybe it was names and i found that this was shockingly fun i what you 're doing is you 're trying to get better and better and better at creating at dreaming up these utterly this is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer 's training kit it 's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes because distraction is the competitive i ended up coming back to that same contest that i had covered a year earlier and i had this notion that i might enter it sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism it 'd make i thought maybe a nice epilogue to all my research problem was the experiment went haywire i won the contest laughter which really wasn 't supposed to happen it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists but it 's actually kind of beside the point and you don 't have great memories we remember when we are deeply and figure out why it is meaningful to us why it is significant why it 's colorful when we 're able to transform it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds when we 're able to transform bakers they force a kind of and i think if there 's one thing that i want to leave you with left me with which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories how much are we willing to lose from our already short lives by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us by being so lazy that we 're not willing to process deeply i learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us but if you want to live a memorable life you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember thank you"
