  "transcript": "what if our plants what if those plants could also remove those toxins from the soil what if those plants grew their own packaging what happens when biological design is driven by the motivations of mass produced commodities what kind of world would that be my name is ani and i 'm a designer and researcher at mit media lab where i 'm part of a relatively new and unique group called design fiction where we 're wedged somewhere between science fiction and science fact and at mit i am lucky enough to rub shoulders with scientists studying all kinds of cutting edge fields like synthetic neurobiology artificial intelligence artificial life and everything in between and across campus there 's truly brilliant scientists asking questions like how can i make the world a better place and part of what my group likes to ask is what is better what is better for you for me for a white woman a gay man a veteran a child with a prosthetic technology is never neutral can you imagine what it would say about the work life balance at your office if these were standard issue on the first day laughter i believe it 's the role of artists and designers to raise critical questions art is how you can see and feel the future what are the roles and responsibilities of an artist designer scientist or businessman what are the implications of synthetic biology genetic engineering and how are they shaping our notions of what it what are the implications of this on society on evolution and what are the stakes in this game my own speculative design research at the current moment plays with synthetic biology but for more emotionally driven output i 'm obsessed with olfaction as a design space and this project started with and at the end of the evening the girl would give the guy she most fancied her used fruit and if the feeling was mutual he would wolf down that stinky apple famously napoleon wrote many love letters to josephine but perhaps amongst the most memorable is this brief and urgent note don 't bathe both napoleon and josephine adored violets josephine wore carried violets on their wedding day and napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets every year on their anniversary and i found this so moving i thought could i engineer that violet to smell just like josephine what if for the rest of eternity when you went to visit her site you could smell josephine just as napoleon loved her crops that stand up to transport crops that have a long shelf life sometimes at the expense of nutritional value can we harness these same technologies for an emotionally sensitive output so and it turns out it 's fairly complicated your medications your lifestyle all factor into the way you smell and i found that our sweat is mostly odorless but it 's our bacteria and microbiome that 's responsible for your smells your mood your identity and so much beyond and there 's all kinds of molecules that you emit but which we only perceive subconsciously after talking to a scientist we thought maybe the perfect concoction of ani is like like cornflakes like beef carnitas at the same time i cultivate a set of carnivorous plants for their ability to emit fleshlike odors to attract prey in an attempt to kind of create this symbiotic relationship between my bacteria and this organism and as it so happens i 'm at mit and i 'm in a bar and i was talking to a scientist who happens to be a chemist and a plant scientist and i was telling him about my project and he was like well this sounds like botany for lonely women for some reason he was like sure why not so we started with can we get a plant to grow towards me like i was the sun and so we 're looking at mechanisms in plants such as phototropism which causes the plant to to grow towards the sun by producing hormones like auxin which causes cell elongation on the shady side and right now i 'm creating a set of lipsticks that are infused with these chemicals that allow me to interact with a plant on its own chemical signatures lipsticks that cause plants to grow where i kiss it and through these projects i 'm asking questions like how do we define nature and when should we do it should we do it for for utility can biotechnology be used to create work as moving as music what are the thresholds between science and its ability to shape our emotional landscape it well now wedged somewhere between & d lab would that look like and what kind of questions would we ask together we often look but as an artist and designer i like to ask but what is the question"
