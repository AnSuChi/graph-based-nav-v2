  "transcript": "there 's so many good people trying to do so much good it feels like i 've landed in a colony of angels it 's a true feeling but and she 's a very uses smart boards she blogs she tweets she does facebook she does all this sort of high tech stuff she 's a but in her office there 's this old wooden table kitchen table why is this old table in your office and she told me she said you know i grew up in southwestern virginia in the coal and we 'd come in from playing he 'd come in from plowing and working and we 'd sit around that table every night and as i grew up i heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table i began to call it the wisdom and when he passed on i took this table with me and brought it to my office and it reminds me of him it reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes the project i 'm going to tell you about is called the world peace game and essentially it is also an empty space and i 'd like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table really it all started back in and i had been dropping in and out of college and i remember the last time i came back from india in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my and so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something so i got a degree and it turned out to be education it was an experimental education program it could have been dentistry but the word experimental and i bought a three piece suit my concession to convention kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes at the time it was the ' 70s and i walked in and i sat down and had an interview and i guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor her name was anna aro said i had and i said what do i do and her answer shocked me it stunned me her answer set the template for the entire career i was to have after that she said what do you want to do and that question cleared the space there was no program directive no manual to follow and she cleared such a space that i endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students an empty space whereby they could and i was teaching many years later and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker his name is chris farina chris farina is here today at his own cost chris could you stand up and let them see you a young visionary filmmaker he proposed the film to me and i said yeah maybe it 'll be on local tv and we can say hi to our friends but the film has really gone places now it 's still in debt but chris has managed through his own sacrifice to get this film out so we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me more than a story about one teacher it 's a story that 's a testament to teaching and teachers and it 's a beautiful thing and the strange thing is when i watch the film i have the eerie sensation of seeing it i saw myself literally disappear what i saw was i saw my geometry teacher in high school that 's the smile i use that 's his smile and i saw miss ethel j banks who wore pearls and high heels and i 'm not even talking about you behind me because i 've got eyes in the back of my head you and miss banks was there as a great mentor for me and then i saw spatial thinker that 's my brother malcolm there on the right and really i feel as though when i see the film i i have a gesture she does like this i feel like i am a continuation of her gesture i am one of her teaching gestures there are many people on this stage right now and so this world peace game i 'd like to tell you about it started out like this it 's just a four foot by five foot plywood board in in an inner city urban school one thousand nine i wanted to have them so i thought well they like to play games i 'll make something and it has since evolved to a there 's an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining there 's an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining i choose the prime minister based on my relationship with them i offer them the job they can turn it down arms dealers and a united nations there 's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather and then there 's a we have chemical famine endangered species i 'm going to send my fourth graders from agnor hurt and venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week several times too so i also have in the game a saboteur some child it 's basically a troublemaker and i have my troublemaker and they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies trying to cause the saboteur is there and we also read from sun tzu 's the art of war fourth graders understand it nine years old and they handle that and use that to understand how to not follow the path to war they learn to overlook reactions and impulsive thinking to think in a stewart brand is here and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a coevolution quarterly article i 'm just a i 'm just a clarifier i 'm just a facilitator the students run the game i have no chance to make any policy and he 's trying to tell us how to fix that problem john hunter i offered them a actually i can 't tell them anything because i don 't know the answer and i admit the truth to them right up front i don 't know but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape and we hope you can fix it for us and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it it 's a sincere apology and they take it very seriously now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like start here 's what you see jh all right we 're going into negotiations as of now go jh i 've learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time there 's a trust so i 'll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things in this game we had a little girl and she was the defense minister of the poorest nation without provocation suddenly she attacked against her prime minister 's orders without firing a shot and secured it and held it and that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up we were all upset with her why are you doing this this is the world peace game what is wrong with you this was a little girl and at nine years old she held her pieces and said i know what i 'm doing to her girlfriends she said that that 's a breach there and we learned in this you don 't really ever want to cross a nine year old girl with tanks but come to find out a few game days later and there are turns where we take and each team takes a turn then we go back in so a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world she was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us now she used a small war to avert a larger war so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right conditional good or not right that 's the kind of thinking that we put them in the situations i could not have designed that in teaching it it came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom beautiful thing happened we have a letter in the game if you 're a military commander and you wage troops the little plastic toys on the board and you lose them i put in a letter you have to write a letter to their parents so you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat and so we had this situation come up last summer actually at agnor hurt school in albemarle county and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said mr hunter let 's ask there 's a parent over there there was a parent visiting that day just sitting in the back of the room let 's ask that mom to read the letter it 'll be more realer if she reads it by the third and it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding i 'll show you what my friend david says about this he 's been in many battles david we 've really had 'm feeling really weird because i 'm living what sun tzu said one week one week he said those who go into battle and win will want to go back and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win and so i 've been winning battles so i 'm going i think it 's sort of weird to be living what sun tzu said jh i get chills every time i see that that 's the kind of engagement you want to have happen and i can 't design that i can 't plan that and i can 't even test that we know that 's an authentic assessment of learning we have a lot of data but i think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what 's going on just share a third story this is about my friend brennan we had played the game one and we had essentially solved all fifty of the interlocking crises the way the game is won is all fifty problems have to be every country 's asset value has to be increased above its starting point some are poor some are wealthy there are billions the i 've got to calculate that right away but he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him so and we were approaching four o 'clock our cut off time there was about a minute left and despair just settled i should have gotten it so they could have won and i was just feeling so sad and dejected and suddenly brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell the bell i ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets and he ran principal walks in i 'm out of a job the parents were looking in the window and brennan runs back to his seat everybody runs back to their seat he rings the bell again he says we have and there 's twelve seconds left on we have all nations pooled all our funds together and we 've got six hundred billion dollars we 're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country and if they accept it it 'll raise their asset value and we can win the game will you accept it everybody looks at this prime minister of that country spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for that was unexpected and unpredictable but i don 't try to deny them that reality of being human i allow them to go there and through their own experience learn in a bloodless way how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing and they find out what is right their own way their own selves but i would say that if if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game they may save"
