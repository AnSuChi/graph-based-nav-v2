  "transcript": "what was the most difficult job you ever did was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property was it working alone or working on a project that wasn 't guaranteed to succeed was it work for which you were never sure you were fully understood the people in our communities who do these jobs deserve our attention our love and our the only ones in our communities who do these difficult jobs including the ecosystems i study the tropical coral reefs income and food security for hundreds of millions of people around the world coral reefs the structures that they build protect our shorelines from storm surge and waves and the biological systems that they house filter the water and make it safer for us to work and play coral reefs the molecules that we 're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important and this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry in many countries we have done almost everything we possibly could and these would all be bad on but these threats magnify each other and compound one another and make each other worse i 'll give you an example the tropical storm picked up the dead corals and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left this is a coral that i studied during my phd i got to know it quite well and after this storm took off half of its tissue it became infested with algae the algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died this magnification of threats this compounding of factors is what jeremy jackson describes as the slippery slope to slime it 's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally but i have a confession to make whether i see it in a tweet in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure that no matter how educated is not sure what a coral is or where they come from how would we get someone to care about the world 's coral reefs when it 's an abstract thing they can barely understand if they don 't understand what a coral is or where it comes from or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is why would we expect them to care about saving them so let 's change that what is a coral and where does it come from corals are born in a number of different ways but most often by mass spawning releasing all the eggs they 've made that year into the water column packaged into bundles and hopefully hopefully at the surface of the ocean they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals and that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface when they 're fertilized they do what any other animal egg divides in half again and again and again taking these photos under the microscope every year is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year at the end of all this cell division they turn into a swimming larva they can sense color and light and they use those talents to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives so imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old one coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals but these systems house and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems and it 's where we 're finding our new medicines it 's how we find new sources of food i 'm lucky enough to work on the island of curaao where we still have reefs that look like this but indeed much of the caribbean and much of our world is much more like but in my research i 'm not interested in looking backward my colleagues and i in curaao are interested in looking forward at what might be and we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long and we 're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions so in the research i do with my colleagues in curaao we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage what it 's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process i 'm going to show you three examples of the work we 've done to try to answer those questions a few years ago we took a 3d printer and we made coral choice surveys different colors and different textures and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle and we found that corals even without the biology so we can use this knowledge we can go back and say we need to restore those factors that pink that white those crevices those hard surfaces in our conservation projects we can also use that knowledge if we 're going to put something underwater like a sea wall or a pier we can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals we also study the chemical and microbial signals that attract corals to reefs starting about six years ago i began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled and i tried those one by one by one looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach and we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer so as we speak my colleagues in curaao are testing those bacteria to see if they 'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab now in addition to these tools we also try to uncover the mysteries of is one of my favorite corals and always has been because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy finding one of these on a reef is a treat and this was in part because in over thirty years of research surveys scientists had never found a baby pillar coral we weren 't even sure if they could still reproduce or if they were still reproducing so four years ago we started following these at night and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in curaao and eventually we figured out when they and here 's a male on the right releasing sperm thanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles and thanks to the ten years of practice we 've had we got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process and settle and attach so this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw and i have to say if you think baby pandas are cute this is cuter maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures so that we can preserve their genetic genetic diversity and work with them more often so low tech we are limited by the space on our bench the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffees we can drink we have advanced medical technology but our technology for conservation is think back to the most difficult job you ever did many of you would say it was being a parent my mother described being a parent as something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult than you could 've ever possibly imagined i 've been trying to help corals become parents for over ten years now and we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab and here you see one embryo dividing alongside fourteen eggs that didn 't fertilize and will will blow up they 'll be infected with bacteria they will explode and those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo that has a chance and we don 't know if it was just this coral on this reef we have much more work to do before we can they 're providing us with art but a few made it thank you so much"
