  "transcript": "it even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you 've seen what 's unusual about this one that people have just sort of figured out about it and now with kyoto and the governator and people beginning to actually do something we may be on the road to a solution the fact is uh uh and that it 's accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back so that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line but in fact they 're growing faster and the rate at which the arctic sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models so despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning and politicians signing treaties in fact you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative because it 's just consumed a lot of jet fuel basically really not very much i don 't want to depress and even soluble in a way that 's reasonably cheap cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military not the cost dealing with electricity production which causes something like and wind power nuclear power and coal to co2 capture which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment and work all we lack is the instead we spend our time talking but nevertheless that 's not what i 'm going to talk to you about tonight what i 'm going to talk to which is what you do if you don 't stop the emissions quickly enough and and that 's particularly important because of course while we can adapt to climate change and it 's important to be honest here there will be some benefits to climate change oh yes i think it 's bad i 've spent my whole life working to stop it but one of the reasons it 's politically hard is there are winners and losers not all losers so this problem is absolutely soluble this geo engineering idea in it 's simplest form is basically the following you could put signed particles say sulfuric acid particles sulfates into the upper the stratosphere where they 'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet and it was done not by us not by me but by nature here 's mount pinatubo in the early ' 90s that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere so this lower bar is the upper atmosphere the stratosphere and it heats up after these volcanoes but you 'll notice that in the upper bar which is the lower atmosphere and the surface it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit but it clearly cools down and one other thing much of the other things that we ought to do like slowing emissions are intrinsically slow because it takes takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions and not only that when you cut emissions and there are times you might like to do something quick does it work can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co2 and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally and the answer seems to be the lower graph is with twice the amount of it 's important to say came because ken at a meeting that i believe marty hoffart was also at in the mid ' 90s ken and i stood up at the back of the meeting and said geo engineering won 't work and to the person who was promoting it said the atmosphere 's much more complicated gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn 't do a very good compensation ken went and ran his models and found that it did this topic is also old that report that landed on president johnson 's desk when i was two years old in fact which had all the modern climate science the only thing they talked about doing was geo engineering it didn 't even talk about cutting emissions which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem people always talked about this idea not as something that was foolproof but as an idea to think about but when climate became politically a hot topic if i may make the pun in in the last fifteen years this became so un pc we couldn 't talk about it it just sunk the surface we weren 't allowed to speak about it but in the last year paul crutzen published this essay the big even though there will be some ozone impacts and in fact he had some ideas to make them go away there was all sorts of press coverage all over the world and i was actually lying in bed thinking one night and i thought about this child 's toy hence the title of my talk and i wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin ' round in the child 's radiometer to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly the other problem is they 're right in the ozone layer and i 'd prefer them above the ozone layer and it turns out i woke up the next morning and i started to calculate this it was very hard to calculate from first principles i was stumped but then i found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere so it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere about one hundred kilometers up that already have this effect i 'll tell you very quickly how the effect works there are a lot of fun complexities that i 'd love to spend the whole evening on gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity and so you see a net force away from the sun that 's called the photophoretic force but it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes much longer than before because they 're levitated we can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere in principle solving the ozone problem i 'm sure there will be other problems that arise finally we could make the particles migrate to over the poles so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet where we live and do the maximum job of what we might need to do which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency if you like this is a new idea that 's crept up that may be essentially a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in whether we like it or not give us more and more leverage to affect the planet to control the planet to give us weather and climate control not because we plan it not because we just because science delivers it to us bit by bit with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it now suppose that space aliens arrived maybe they 're going to land at the u n headquarters down the road here or maybe they 'll pick a smarter spot but and the box has two knobs one knob is the knob for controlling global temperature maybe another knob is a knob for controlling might imagine that we would fight wars over that box because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs we have no global governance and different people will have different places they want it set but we 're building that box the scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece in their labs and so i guess my view on this is not that i want to do it i do not and it 's better if we think hard about it even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it 'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it but what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this we need a broader debate a debate that involves writers who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are so here 's one way to think about it it 's conceivable that say using the sulfates method or this method i 've come up with you could create an ice age at a cost of it 's very cheap we have a lot of leverage it 's not a good you might argue about the sanity of it but the leverage is real so because of this we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions and just as as the concentrations we can increase the amount of geo engineering i don 't think anybody takes that seriously we walk further and further away from the current climate we have all sorts of other problems like ocean acidification that come from co2 in the atmosphere anyway but here 's a case which is harder to reject but we don 't really know how quickly we have to cut them there 's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much and maybe someday like two october twenty three we finally reach that that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side and we have global celebrations and we 've actually started to you know we 've seen the worst of it but maybe on that day we also find that the greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast fast enough to put meters of sea level and remove some of the biggest cities from the map that 's an absolutely possible scenario we might decide at that point that even though geo engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy that it 's a lot better than not it 's saying that you do some geo engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off not that you 'd use it as a substitute for action knowledge that geo engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today this is what economists but you don 't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer i 'll leave you with three questions and then one final quote should we do serious research on this topic some in a positive side some in a negative side but that 's a dangerous state to be in because there 's very little depth of knowledge on this topic another thing is maybe we need a treaty but it might well be that in fact if china wakes up in two thousand and thirty and realizes that the climate impacts are just may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this and they may just decide they 'd really rather have a geo engineered world than a non geo engineered world and we 'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision"
