  "transcript": "i got my start in writing and research as a surgical trainee as someone who was a long ways away from becoming any kind of an expert at the natural question you ask then at that point is how do i get good at what i 'm trying to do and it became a question of how do we all get good at what we 're trying to do try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you 're taking on i had to think about how i sew and how i cut but then also how i pick the right person to come to an operating room and then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good in the last few years we realized we were in the deepest crisis of medicine 's existence due to something you don 't normally think about when you 're a doctor concerned with how you do good for people which is the cost there 's not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do the political fight that we 've developed has become one around whether it 's the government that 's the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem and the answer is yes and no it 's deeper than all of that the cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us and in order to understand this i 'm going to take you back a couple of generations i want to take you back to a time when lewis thomas was writing in his book the youngest science lewis thomas was and he wrote this book to explain among other things what it was like to be a medical intern at the boston city hospital in the year of it was going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth doctors and medicine made no difference at all that didn 't seem to prevent the doctors from being frantically busy in their days as he explained what they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses for which they could and they could give you an antiserum an injection of rabid antibodies if you had an acute they could bleed a pint of blood if you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions you might figure out that this paralysis someone has in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic beyond these sorts of things a medical doctor didn 't have a lot that they could do this was when the core structure of medicine was created what what it meant to be good at what we did and and how we wanted to build medicine to be was at a time when what was known you could know you could hold it all in your head and you could do it all if you had a prescription pad you you spun the blood looked at it under the microscope you plated the culture you injected the antiserum this was a life as a craftsman as a result we built it around a culture and set of values that said what you were good at was being daring at being courageous our highest value and it looks like a completely different world we have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have we can 't cure it all we can 't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life but we can make it possible for most but what does it take well we 've now discovered four thousand medical and surgical procedures we 've discovered six thousand drugs that i 'm now licensed to prescribe and we 're trying to deploy this capability town by town to every person alive and we 've reached the point where we 've realized as doctors we can 't know it all we can 't do it all there was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital as it changed over it took basically the nursing time and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day it had become more than fifteen clinicians for the same typical hospital patient the nurses we even the primary care physicians everyone just has a piece but holding onto that structure we built around the daring independence each of those people but it 's pit crews that we need pit crews for patients forty percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn 't have because someone failed to follow the basic practices of our experience as people who get sick need help from other people is that we have incredibly well trained and very smart but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish and that 's the unmanageable cost of our care now we in medicine i think are baffled by this question of cost we want to say this is just the way it is this is when you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin that mostly didn 't do the job to one where if it gets bad enough we can do a hip replacement a knee replacement that gives you without disability a dramatic change well is it any surprise that that $ forty but i think we 're ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do as we 've looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity has increased we found that the most expensive care and vice versa the best care often turns out to be the least expensive and what that means is because [ if ] to have the best results you really needed the most expensive care in the country or in the world well then we really would be talking about rationing who we 're going to cut off from medicare that would be really our only choice but when we look at the positive deviants the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful that is to say having great components is not enough and yet we 've been obsessed in medicine with components we want the best drugs the best technologies the best specialists it 's a terrible design strategy actually well it would lead you to put in porsche brakes a ferrari and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way unsexy as that sounds one of my colleagues is a surgeon in cedar rapids iowa he got interested in this because there had been government took him three months no one had asked this question in his community before and what he found was that for the three hundred thousand people in their community in the previous year they had done fifty two thousand ct scans they had found which brings us to skill number two a system has skill one find where your failures are skill two is devise solutions but the safety of surgery had not now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to do more training give people more specialization or and yet we see unconscionable levels of and so we looked at what other high risk industries do and we found that they have technology they have training and then they have one other thing i did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a and yet what we found were that these were tools to help we got the lead safety engineer for boeing to help us could we design a checklist for surgery not for the lowest people on the totem pole understood you have to think about things like pause points you need to identify the moments in a process when you can actually catch a problem before it 's a danger and do something about it you have to identify that this is a checklist and then you need to focus on the killer items it 's a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they 're not checked so we did this we created a checklist for surgical teams we had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given immediately and we had a mix of dumb stuff on there making sure an antibiotic you can make a and we had items like you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day that you 're coming in we implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world we found that after they adopted forty seven percent this was bigger than a drug and that brings us to skill number three the ability to implement this to get colleagues across the entire chain and it 's been slow to spread this is not yet our norm in surgery there 's a deep resistance because using these tools forces forces us to behave with a different teamwork this is the opposite of what we were built on by the way i asked him what was it like to actually herd a thousand cattle across hundreds of miles how did you do that and he said we have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around they communicate electronically constantly and they have protocols and checklists for how they handle everything even the cowboys are pit crews now but i would go further and say that making systems work education climate change making a pathway out of poverty is the great task of our generation as a whole and we 've come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize as individualistic as we want to be complexity requires group success we all need to be pit crews now"
