  "transcript": "less than a year after september eleven and i was at the chicago tribune writing about shootings and murders and it was leaving me feeling pretty dark and depressed i thought it would be a safe way to do something positive but of course i have the absolute worst luck ever and we were all arrested police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence my charges were dismissed but a few weeks later two fbi agents knocked on my door and they told me that unless i helped them by spying on protest they would put me on a domestic terrorist list but i was terrified and when my fear subsided i became obsessed with finding out how this happened how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the fbi 's number one domestic terrorism threat a few years later i was invited to testify before congress about my reporting and i told lawmakers that while everybody is talking about going green they 're physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers ' harpoons and the whales these are everyday people like these protesters in italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing and these movements have been incredibly effective and popular so in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five their opponents made up a new word to shift how we view them they just made it up which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits including members of congress less than one percent were in the room when it passed the house the rest were outside at a new memorial supporters say laws like this are needed for the extremists the arsonists the radicals but right now companies like transcanada are briefing police in presentations like this one about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters as terrorists the fbi 's training documents on they 're about public relations today in multiple countries corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism ag gag prosecutions as they 're called and amy did what any of us would she filmed it through the freedom of information act i learned that the counter terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one blurb on the next book right but as a journalist i have an unwavering faith in the power of education our best weapon is sunlight dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man is to prove he 's a man and not a piano key thank you"
