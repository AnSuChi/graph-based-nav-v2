  "transcript": "it 's easy to forget that last night one billion people went to sleep without access to electricity one billion people two and a half billion people did not have access to clean cooking fuels or clean heating fuels those are the problems in the developing world we see the tension of stagnant economies where the people involved have lost hope about the future but even in countries as recently turning the we see the difficulty that president xi has as he so many people in his coal and mining industries who see no future for themselves as we as a society figure out how to manage the problems of the developed world we have to look at how we move forward and manage the environmental impact of those decisions we 've been working on this problem for twenty five years since the kyoto protocols our most recent move is the paris treaty i think we can be very hopeful that those agreements which are bottom up agreements where nations have said what they think they can do the unfortunate thing is that now as we look at the independent analyses of what those climate treaties are liable to yield this is the united states energy information agency 's assessment of what will happen if the countries implement the climate commitments that they 've made in paris there are three things that you need to look at and appreciate one co2 emissions are expected to continue to grow for the next thirty years in order to control climate co2 emissions have to literally go to zero because it 's the cumulative emissions that drive heating on the planet the second thing you should notice is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries which includes south africa and indonesia and brazil as most of these countries move their people into the lower range of lifestyles that we literally take for granted the final thing that you should notice is that each year about ten gigatons of carbon are getting added to the planet 's atmosphere and then diffusing into the ocean and into the land that 's on top of the five hundred and fifty and that probably goes a long way towards locking in a 2 4 degree c increase in global mean surface temperatures locking in ocean acidification and locking in sea level rise now this is a projection made by men and it 's ours to change not to accept but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate different nations make different energy choices it 's a function of their natural resources it 's a function of where on the surface of the planet they are are they where it 's dark a lot of the time or are they at the the overwhelming thing that we need to appreciate is the choice that china has made china has made and will make the choice to run on coal the united states has an alternative it can run on natural gas as a result of the inventions of fracking and shale gas which we have here they provide an alternative the oecd europe has a choice it has renewables that it can afford to deploy in germany because it 's rich enough to afford to do it the french and the british show interest in nuclear power eastern europe still very heavily committed to natural gas and to coal and with natural gas that comes from russia with all of its entanglements china has many fewer choices and a much harder row to hoe if you look at china you ask yourself why has coal been important to it you have to remember what china 's done china brought people to power not power to people it urbanized by taking low cost labor and low cost energy creating export industries that could fund a tremendous amount of growth look at china 's path all of us know that prosperity in china has dramatically increased in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eighty percent of china 's population lived below the extreme poverty level below the level of having $ one point nine per person per day by the year two thousand only twenty percent of china 's population lived below the extreme poverty level it allowed sewage pipes to be placed the number one killer in china is indoor air pollution it 's still estimated that two hundred they have a remarkable path to follow india also needs to meet the needs of its own people and it 's going to do that by burning coal when we look at the eia 's projections of coal burning in india india will supply nearly four times as much of its energy so what can we do to stop coal 's emissions in time what can we do that changes this forecast that 's in front of us because it 's a forecast that we can change if we have the will to do it first of all we have to think about the magnitude of the problem eight hundred to one thousand six hundred new coal plants are going to be built around the world coal plants are being turned on around the world that 's happening regardless of what we want because the people that rule their countries assessing the interests of their citizens have decided it 's in the interest of their citizens to do that and that 's going to happen unless they have and every one hundred of those plants will use up between one percent and three percent so every day that you go home thinking that you should do something about global warming at the end of that week remember somebody fired up a coal plant that 's going to run for fifty years and take away your ability you had to create a technology that passed the chindia test meaning that technically they could implement it in their country and that it would be accepted by the people in the country two it had to be a technology that was scalable that it could deliver the same benefits on the same timetable and third it had to be it had to stand on its own two feet it could not be maintained for that many people if in fact those countries had to go begging or had some foreign country say i won 't trade with you in order to get the technology shift to we simply have not come up with alternatives that meet that test that 's what the eia forecast tells us china 's building eight hundred gigawatts of coal four hundred gigawatts of hydro about two hundred gigawatts of nuclear and on an energy equivalent basis adjusting about one hundred gigawatts of renewables but that 's what they 're aiming for in two thousand and forty unless we give them a better choice if you look at all the alternatives that are out are really two that come near to meeting it first is this area of new nuclear that i 'll talk about in just a second it 's a new generation of nuclear plants that are on the drawing boards around the world and the people who are developing these say we can get them in position to demo by the second alternative that could be versus the batteries which are still under development so what 's holding new nuclear back we have new scientific the second thing is we 've got a mindset that it takes twenty five years and two to five billion dollars to develop a nuclear power plant that comes from the historical military mindset of the places nuclear power came from these new nuclear ventures are saying that they deliver power for five cents a kilowatt hour they can deliver it for one hundred gigawatts a year they can demo it by if they can 't make it safe if they can 't make it cheap it should thank you very much"
