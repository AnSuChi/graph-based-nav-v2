  "transcript": "an ecologist and sean 's a physicist and we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short ted talk about the ecology of war and we realized that we connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met and then we thought you know there are thousands of other talks out there especially tedx talks that are popping up all over the world how are they connected and what does that global conversation look like so sean 's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that sean gourley exactly so and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structures and so of course if you 're going to do this kind of stuff you need a lot of data so the data that you 've got but we can also pull up using speech to text translation we can pull the entire transcript and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself and we call that the meme ome and we can do some pretty interesting analysis which i want to share with you now we can create a link and represent that as a graph just like eric and i are connected and we started to see where the connections so from this we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection but luckily computer technology allows us to go out into and what we 're left with is something quite beautiful eb keep going sg absolutely so i got a little we 've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media you 've got of course the human brain right next to healthcare which you might expect and i want to kind of zoom on that and see if we can get a little more resolution so as we go in here what we start to see apply the physics engine again we see what 's one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones the structure starts to emerge where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world so you 've got food economy and local food at the top you 've got greenhouse gases solar and nuclear waste what if we split along gender lines we can see females resonating heavily with but also out there in hope and optimism and so there 's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here just to point out here you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on youtube let 's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment and look at all the talks together now often when we 're faced with this amount of content we do a couple of things to simplify it and of course there 's got to be one about porn right and we can see that the new emerging top trending topic is about digital privacy and i hate that how do we bubble stuff up to the surface that 's maybe really creative and interesting well we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that remember it 's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics and let 's say we could take two of them like cities and genetics and say well are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines and that 's essentially this kind of creative remix what talks are central to those conversations in the cities cluster one of the most central was one by by mitch joachim about ecological cities and in the genetics cluster what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields we used a measure of ecological diversity to get this like a talk by steven pinker on the history of violence very synthetic and we call that the colleen flanagan index and if you don 't know colleen she 's an artist and i asked her 's it like out there in the stratosphere of our idea space and apparently it smells like bacon i wouldn 't know and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate of complexity or the patterns of how things are connected sg so that 's exactly right we 've got and we can do better than that because we can realize that their complexity is not random it has mathematical structure and to be a little bit more human and hopefully a little smarter thank you"
