  "transcript": "medicine has done a much better job of making us live longer and the problem is as we our organs tend to fail more and so currently there are not enough organs to go around in fact in the last ten years the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled while in the same time the actual number of transplants has barely gone up so this is now a public health crisis so that 's where this field comes in that we call the field of regenerative medicine it really involves many different areas you can use actually scaffolds biomaterials they 're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt but specific materials you can actually implant in patients and they will do well and help you regenerate either your very own cells or different stem cell populations but it 's actually not a new field interestingly this is a book that was published back in 's titled the culture of organs the first author alexis carrel a nobel prize winner he actually devised some of the same technologies used today for suturing blood vessels that 's the same charles lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with alexis at the rockefeller institute in new york so if the field 's been around for so long why so few clinical advances and that really has to do to many different challenges but if i were to point to three challenges there 's still certain cells that we just can 't grow from the patient pancreatic cells we still can 't grow them even today so we can actually use biomaterials now this is actually a biomaterial we can weave them knit them or we can make them like you see here this is actually like a cotton candy machine you saw the spray going in that was like the fibers of the cotton candy creating this structure this tubularized structure which is a biomaterial that we can then use to help your body regenerate using your very own cells to do so and we then created one of these smart biomaterials and then we then used that smart biomaterial to replace and repair that patient 's structure and you see that patient now six months showing you the regenerated tissue which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope we can also use cells alone these are actually cells that we obtained these are stem cells that we create from specific sources and we can drive them to become heart cells and they start beating in culture so they know what to do the cells genetically know what to do and they start beating together now today many clinical trials are using different kinds of so that 's actually now in patients so the concept here so if you do have a deceased or injured organ we take a very small piece of that tissue less than we then take a scaffold a biomaterial again looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt we then shape that material and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time we then place it in an and we 're able to create that structure and bring it out this is actually a heart valve and then we exercise it so you see the leaflets opening and closing of this heart valve that 's currently being used experimentally to try to get it another we then grow the cells outside the body take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells the patient 's own cells two different cell types we then put it in this as the human body thirty seven degrees centigrade ninety five percent oxygen a few weeks later you have your engineered organ that we 're able to implant back into the patient for these specific patients we actually just suture these materials we use but we now have better ways to create these structures with the cells we use now some type of technologies where for solid organs for example like the liver what we do is we take discard livers and we then put them in a washing machine like structure two weeks later you have and we then can preserving the blood vessel tree so we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree with the patient 's own blood vessel cells and we then infiltrate the another technology that we 've used is actually that of printing this is actually a desktop inkjet printer and you can actually see here the printhead going through and printing this structure and it takes about forty minutes to print this structure and there 's that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through and then finally you 're able to get that structure out you can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it and this is actually a piece of bone that i 'm going to show you that was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques another so what you see here i know it sounds funny but what you want to do is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound and you have a scanner basically like a flatbed scanner that 's what you see here on the right side you see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient once it 's scanned it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be and now you 're going to see here a demo of this actually being done and this is actually new technology still we 're also working on more sophisticated printers because in reality our biggest challenge are the solid organs i don 't know if you realize this but ninety percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney so this is more challenging so the strategy here is this is actually a ct scan an x ray and we go layer by layer using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient 's own kidneys we then are able to actually image those do three hundred and sixty degree rotation and we then are able to actually take this information and we then are able to send that information as you see here through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient this actually shows the actual printer so while we 've been talking today and that 's been printing this kidney structure that you see here it takes about seven hours to print a kidney so this is about three hours into it now dr kang 's going to walk onstage right now and we 're actually going to show you one of these kidneys put a pair of gloves here thank you go backwards so these gloves are a little bit small on me but here it is you can actually see that kidney as it was printed a little bit of consistency to it this is dr kang who 's been working with us on this project and part this is actually the printer that you see here onstage and this is actually a new technology we 're working on now in reality we now have a long history of doing this i 'm going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for and this is actually a very brief clip only about thirty seconds of a patient who actually received an organ luke massella i was really sick i could barely get out of bed i was missing school it was pretty much miserable i couldn go out and play i was facing basically a lifetime life got a lot better for me i was able to do more things i was able to wrestle in high school i became the captain of the team and that was great i was able to be a normal kid with my friends and because they used my own cells to build this bladder it 's going to be with me i 've got it for life so come up please last time you saw tony lm ten years ago when i had my surgery and it 's really great well right now i 'm in college at the university of connecticut i 'm a sophomore and studying communications tv and mass media and basically trying to live life like a normal kid which i always wanted growing up but it was hard to do that when i was born with spina bifida and my kidneys and bladder weren 't working i went through about sixteen surgeries and and this surgery came along and basically made me who i am today and saved my life from he 's working really hard in his lab and coming up with crazy stuff i know i was one of the first ten people to have this surgery and when i was ten i didn 't realize how amazing it was i was a little kid and i was like yeah i 'll have that i 'll have that surgery laughter all i wanted to do was to get better and i didn 't realize how amazing it really was until now that i 'm older and i see the amazing things that he 's doing when you got this call out of the blue and it took a lot of convincing so luke you go to your communications professors you 're majoring in communications and you ask them for permission to come to ted which might have a little bit to do with communications a couple that were a little stubborn but i had to talk to them i pulled them aside je well it 's an honor and a privilege to meet you thank you so"
