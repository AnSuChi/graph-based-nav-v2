  "transcript": "now in hindsight it was actually good for some things like mixing a can of paint or shaking a polaroid at the time this was really doomsday this was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist the shake developed out of really a single minded pursuit of pointillism just years of making tiny tiny dots and eventually these dots went from so to compensate i 'd hold the pen tighter and this progressively made the shake worse so i 'd hold the pen tighter still and this became a vicious cycle that ended up and after and then i left art completely but after a few years i just couldn 't stay away from art and i decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and and he actually took one look at my squiggly line and said well why don 't you just embrace the shake i was making all these scribble pictures seeing these little or in a 3d structure consisting of creating a 2d image by burning it with a i ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons this was the first time i 'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity i was finishing up school and i was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies i had this horrible little set of tools and i felt like i could do so much more with the supplies i thought an artist was supposed to have i got a job i got a paycheck i got myself to the art and then when i got home i sat down and i set myself to task to and nothing came to mind and i was in a dark place for a long time unable to create and it didn 't make any sense because i was finally able to support my art but as i searched around in the darkness i realized i was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that i never had before and it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands embrace the shake and i realized if i ever wanted my creativity i had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it i wondered could you become more creative then by looking for limitations at this point i was spending a lot of my evenings in well i guess i still spend a lot of my evenings in starbucks but i know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one i decided to ask for fifty surprisingly they just handed them right over and then with some pencils i already had i made this project for only eighty cents it really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited so i painted thirty images one layer at a time one on top of another with each picture representing an influence in my life or what if instead of painting with a brush i could only paint with karate chops so i 'd dip my hands in paint and i just i just attacked the canvas and i actually hit so hard that i bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks their stories became the art as i wrote them onto the revolving canvas i had to destroy it where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation the beginning of goodbye art i focused on forced destruction like this image of jimi hendrix made with over seven thousand matches like spitting out food sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine so i organized candles on a table i lit them and then blew them out then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles twenty three different pieces with nothing left to physically display what i thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation as each time i created the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where i felt refreshed and ready to start the next project it did but having committed to the process i continued on and something really surprising came out of this as i destroyed each project i was learning to let go let go of outcomes let go of failures and in return i found a process of creating art that 's perpetual i found myself in a state of constant creation thinking only of what 's next and coming up with more ideas than ever i gave up because ultimately most of what we do learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves transform our world looking at limitations as a source of creativity now when i run into a barrier or i find myself creatively stumped i sometimes still struggle but i continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities like using hundreds of real live worms to make an image using a pushpin to tattoo a banana or painting a picture with hamburger grease one of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that i 've learned into something others can replicate limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity but perhaps maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation thank you"
