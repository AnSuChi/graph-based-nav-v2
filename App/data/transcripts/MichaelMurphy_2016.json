  "transcript": "every weekend for as long as i can remember put on a worn sweatshirt and he 'd scrape away at the squeaky old wheel of a house that we lived in i wouldn 't even call it restoration it was a catharsis and then he would repaint where he scraped only to begin again the following year the work of an old house is never meant to be done she told me i immediately moved home to poughkeepsie new york to sit with my father on death watch not knowing what the next days would bring us to keep myself distracted i and i went about finishing what he could now no longer complete the restoration of our old home when that looming three week deadline came and at eighteen months fully in remission when he turned to me and he said you know michael this house saved my life i decided to go to architecture school but there i learned something different about buildings recognition seemed to come to those who prioritized novel and sculptural forms like pickles why was it that the best architects the greatest architecture all beautiful and visionary and innovative is also so rare and seems to serve so very few and more to the point with all of this creative talent what more could we do just as i was about to start my final exams i decided to take a break from an all nighter and go to a lecture paul farmer a leading health activist for the global poor i was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture this is causing epidemic level problems in this hospital in south africa patients that came in with say a broken leg to wait in this unventilated hallway walked out with control had not been thought about and people had died because of it where are the architects and designers to help us build and design hospitals that allow us to heal that following i was in the back of a land rover with a few classmates bumping over the mountainous hillside of rwanda for the next year i 'd be living in butaro in this old guesthouse which was a jail after the genocide i was there to design and build a new type of hospital with dr farmer and his team what if we could design a hospital that flips the hallways on the outside and makes people walk in the exterior if mechanical systems rarely work what if we could design a hospital that could breathe through natural ventilation evidence shows that a simple view of nature can radically improve health outcomes so why couldn 't we design a hospital where every patient had a window with a view simple bruce suggested doing using a method in rwanda called ubudehe which means community works for the community and we excavated that hill in half the time and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand and that half of them be women but for the entire community as a whole we call this the locally fabricated way of building or and it has hire locally source regionally train where you can and most importantly think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve think of it like the local food but for architecture using the lo fab way of building even aesthetic decisions can be designed to impact people 's lives in butaro we chose to use a local volcanic stone found in abundance within the area but often considered a nuisance by we worked with these masons to cut these stones and form them into the walls of the hospital and when they began on this corner and wrapped around the entire hospital they were so good at putting these stones together they asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it and you see what is possible it 's beautiful comes from the fact that i know that hands cut these stones and they formed them into this thick wall made only in this place with rocks from this soil ask not only what is the environmental footprint an important question but what if we also asked what is the human handprint of those who made it and we tested it where we asked if a new hospital could help end the epidemic of cholera we designed a simple strategy to clean contaminated medical waste before it gheskio are already saving lives because of it or malawi we asked if a birthing center could radically reduce maternal and infant mortality we designed a birthing center that would attract women and their attendants to come to the hospital earlier where we asked if an educational center could also be used to protect we used the mud and the dirt and the wood around us to construct a center that would show us ways to protect and conserve our rich biodiversity we were asked to rethink the largest university for the deaf and hard of hearing in the world we wondered could we use arts and culture and design to revitalize this city and other rust belt cities across our nation and turn them into centers for innovation and growth in each of these projects we asked a simple question what more can architecture do and by were forced to consider how we could create jobs how we could source regionally i have learned that architecture can be a transformative engine for change i read an article about a tireless and intrepid civil rights leader named bryan stevenson and bryan had a bold architectural vision he and his team had been documenting the over four thousand lynchings of and they had a plan to mark every county countries like germany and south africa and of course rwanda have found it necessary to build memorials to reflect on the atrocities of their past in order to heal i think your building project is maybe the most important project we could do in america and could change the way we think about racial injustice by any chance do you know who will design it surprisingly shockingly when i got there bryan and his team picked me up and we walked around the city and they took the time to point out the many markers that have been placed all over the city to the history of the confederacy and the very few and then he walked me to a hill it overlooked the whole city and then to the capitol rotunda where george wallace had stood on its steps and and then to the very hill below us he said here we will build a new memorial that will change the identity of this city and of this nation our two teams have worked together over the last year to design this memorial the memorial will take us on a journey almost familiar building type like the parthenon or the colonnade at the vatican but as we enter the ground drops below us and our perception shifts we begin to understand the vast number of those who have yet to be put to rest their names will be engraved on the markers that hang above us and just outside waiting in purgatory to be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred over the next few years this site will bear witness as each of these markers is claimed and visibly placed in those counties our nation will begin to heal from over a century of silence we wondered if we could fill those very columns with the soil from the sites of where these killings occurred brian and his team have begun collecting that soil and preserving it in individual jars the act of collecting soil itself has lead to a type of spiritual healing it 's an act team member noted in the collection of the soil from where will mcbride was lynched if will mcbride left one drop of sweat one drop of blood one hair follicle and that his whole body would be at peace we plan to break ground on this memorial later this year and it will be a place to finally speak of the unspeakable acts that have scarred this nation when thank you very much"
