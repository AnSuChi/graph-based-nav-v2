  "transcript": "i received my gifts she wanted us to experience receiving gifts but also learning the virtue of so she had all of us come to the front of and she said why don 't we just stand here and compliment each other go and pick up your gift and sit down what a wonderful idea right what could go wrong i would give out the heartiest cheer would anyone say anything why don 't you go get your gift and sit down so behave next year someone might say something nice about you well as i 'm describing this you you probably know i remember this really well but i don 't know who felt worse that day was it me or the teacher she must have realized that she turned a team building event when you see people get roasted on tv it was funny there was nothing funny about that day so that that was one version of me and i would die to avoid being in that situation again to get rejected in public again that 's one version then fast forward eight years bill gates i know what i want to do now that night i wrote a letter to my family telling them by age twenty five i will build the biggest company in the world and that company will buy microsoft i totally embraced this idea of conquering the world domination right and i didn 't make this up i did write that letter this is also bad handwriting but i did highlight some key words you get the idea so well then two years later i was presented i jumped on it because that was where bill gates lived right i thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey then fast forward another fourteen years i was thirty nope i didn 't build that company i didn 't even start i was actually a marketing manager for a fortune five hundred company and i felt i was stuck i was stagnant why is that where is that 14 year old who wrote that letter it 's not because he didn 't try it 's because every time i had a new idea every time i wanted to try something new even at work i wanted to make a proposal i wanted to speak up in front of people in a group i felt there was this constant battle and every time that i mean i started my own company when i was thirty if you want to be bill gates you 've got to start sooner or later right when i was and then would bill gates quit after a simple investment rejection so this is where i went online and looked for help google was my friend i searched how do i overcome the fear of rejection i came up with a bunch of psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from i came up with a bunch of rah rah inspirational articles about don 't take it personally just overcome it who doesn 't know that but why was i still so scared then i found this website by luck it 's called rejectiontherapy com rejection therapy was this game invented by this canadian entrepreneur his name is jason comely and and i loved that idea i said you know what i 'm going to do this and i 'll feel myself getting rejected one hundred days and i and i made a video blog day one so this is where i went to where i was working i so i just approached him and the longest walk of my life sir can i borrow one hundred dollars from you because i filmed myself so that night i was watching myself getting rejected i just saw how scared i was i looked like this kid in the sixth sense i saw dead people but then i saw this guy you know he i didn 't do any of that all i did was run i felt wow this is like a microcosm of my life i 'm not going to run and i went to the cashier and said i don 't think they 've ever done burger refill but the life and death feeling i was feeling the first time was no longer there just because i stayed engaged because i didn 't run i said great and then day three getting olympic doughnuts i went to a krispy kreme it 's a doughnut shop in basically you interlink five doughnuts together i mean there 's no way they could say yes right the doughnut maker took me so seriously so she put out paper started jotting down the colors and the rings and is like how can i make this and then fifteen minutes later she came out with a box that looked like olympic rings i just couldn 't believe it and that video got over five million views on youtube the world couldn 't believe that either you know because of that i was in newspapers in talk shows in everything and i became famous a lot of people started writing emails what i really wanted to do was learn and to change myself i discovered so many secrets for example i found if i just don 't i have this dog that would do this go across the street and talk to connie she loves flowers so that 's what i did i went across and knocked on connie 's door and she was so happy to see me there was this flower in connie 's backyard i 'm sure it looks better now but had i left after the initial rejection i would 've thought well it 's because the guy didn 't trust me it 's because i was crazy because i didn 't dress up well using a sales term i converted a referral so for example one day i went to a starbucks you know those i want to give a walmart experience to starbucks customers and he said yeah you can do this just don 't get too weird so for the next hour i was the by the way i don 't know what your career trajectory is don 't be a greeter but then i found i could do this because i mentioned is that weird i mentioned the doubt that he was having and because i mentioned is that weird that means i wasn 't weird that means i was actually thinking just like and then i learned i could fulfill my life dream by asking you know i came from four generations of teachers and my grandma has always told me hey jia you can do anything i lived in austin at the time so i went to university of texas at austin and knocked on professors ' doors and said can i teach your class i didn 't get anywhere the first but because i didn 't run i kept doing it and on the third try the professor was very impressed like no one has done this before and i came in prepared with powerpoints and and my lesson he said wow i can use this this is me you probably can 't see this is a bad picture you know sometimes you get rejected by lighting because i thought i could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking i used to think i have to accomplish all these things have to be a great entrepreneur i quoted martin luther my research i found that people who really change the world who change the way we live and the way we think are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections people like martin luther king jr like mahatma gandhi nelson mandela or even jesus christ have to be those people to learn about rejection and in my case rejection was my curse was my boogeyman it has bothered me my whole life because i was running away from it then i started embracing it i turned that into the biggest gift in my life i use my blog i use my talk i use the book i and i 'm even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection when you get rejected in life when you are facing the next obstacle or next thank you"
