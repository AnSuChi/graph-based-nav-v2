  "transcript": "was asked to come here and speak about creation and i can in fifteen minutes i think i can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of how we cope with creation while creation sometimes seems a bit un graspable or even pointless creativity is always meaningful you know creation is what put that dog in that picture and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters when i just did things then i became an adult and started knowing who i was and tried to maintain that persona i became creative i actually did a book and a that i could track exactly looks like all the craziest things that i had done all my drinking all my parties they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually i 'm talking to you at this moment the reason i 'm talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil if i was born in monterey probably would be in brazil you know i was born in under a climate of you didn 't trust information very much and eventually got involved with advertising my first job in brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of and based on speed angle of approach and actually blocks of text and they also decided that i had to to give me a very ugly plexiglas trophy for it and another point why i 'm here is that the day i went to pick up the plexiglas trophy i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life on my way out i had to break a fight apart somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles they were in tuxedos and fighting it was very ugly and also advertising people do that all the time and i well what happened is when i went back to my car the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun i don 't know why he had a gun and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor the first person was wearing a black tie a tuxedo it was me luckily it wasn 't fatal as you can all see the guy said that he was sorry and i bribed him for compensation money otherwise i press charges and that 's how with this money i paid for a ticket to come to the united states in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three and that 's because i got shot well when i started working with my own work i decided that i shouldn 't do images you know i became i took this very iconoclastic approach i wanted to airbrush naked people on ice for whiskey commercials that 's what i really wanted to do but i they didn 't let me do it so i just you know they would only let me do other things but i wasn 't into selling whiskey i was into selling ice the first works were actually objects it was kind of a mixture of found object they were displayed first at stux gallery in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three this is the clown skull is a remnant of a race of a very evolved race of entertainers they lived in brazil long time ago this is the ashanti joystick unfortunately it has become obsolete because it was designed for atari platform the rocking podium this is the pre columbian coffeemaker actually the idea came out of an argument that i had at starbucks that i insisted that i wasn 't having colombian coffee the coffee the entire encyclopedia britannica bound in a single volume for travel purposes and the half tombstone for people who are not dead yet i wanted to take that into and i decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts so i decided to do work with clouds because clouds can mean anything you want but now i wanted to work in a very low tech way so something that would mean at the same time but i was still you know this is a kitty cloud they 're called equivalents after alfred stieglitz 's work the snail but i was still working with sculpture and i was really trying to go flatter and flatter it was ' ninety four and i saw ghiberti 's door of paradise and he did something that was very tricky he put together two different media from different periods of time first he got and he worked this with and your eye doesn 't know which level to read and you become trapped into this kind of representation so i decided to make these very simple renderings that at first they are taken as a line drawing you know something that 's very and then i did it with wire the idea was to because everybody overlooks white and they would look at it ah it 's a pencil drawing then you have this and you start going deeper and deeper into which is something that 's almost a picture of nothing so this is a lighthouse i don 't know how many yards after john constable departing from the lines i decided to tackle the idea of points like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves and i did work and play with them i got some photographs from them upon my arrival in new york i decided they were children of sugar plantation workers i made portraits of them these are thank you this is the fastest it was just the name of the child with the i realized that i could add still another thing i was trying to make a subject something that would interfere with the it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance and so i decided to make these pictures and they were very large so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them so they 're called pictures of chocolate freud probably could explain chocolate better than i he was the first subject and jackson pollock pictures of crowds are particularly interesting because you know you go to that you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily like a face goes into becoming just a texture paparazzi and i picked minimalist pieces because they 're about and you render this with the most material which is dust itself like you know they do a dna scan of this they will come up with a great mailing list this is richard serra told me it had millions of colors in it you know an artist 's first response to this is who counted it you know and i realized that i never worked with color because i had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors but once they 're applied to numeric structure then you you can feel more comfortable so the first time i worked with colors was by making these mosaics of pantone swatches they end up being very large pictures and i photographed with a very large camera and you have to walk very far to be able to see it also the reference to gerhard richter 's use of color charts and the idea also also entering another realm of representation that 's very common to us today which is the bit map i ended up narrowing the subject to make the same like robert smithson 's spiral jetty and then leaving traces as if i was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original felt that i would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself and at the same time i was doing these very large constructions being one hundred and fifty meters which would be like but or in the small things i was more interested in the things in between you know because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there this is like you see the size of a person over there and because i did these cartoonish clouds over manhattan and in this you 'd have like a something that looks like a cloud and it is a cloud at the same time so they 're like perfect actors i once paid like sixty dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of king lear he stopped being the great actor that i had paid money to see on the other hand you know i paid like three i think and i went to a warehouse in queens to see a version of othello by an amateur group and it was quite fascinating because you know the guy his name was joey grimaldi he impersonated the moorish general"
