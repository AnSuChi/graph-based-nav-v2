  "transcript": "great time to be a molecular biologist by the end of this year we 'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than one thousand euros biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest growing technology sector it has the power potentially to replace our fossil fuels to revolutionize medicine and to touch every aspect of our daily lives so who gets to do it i think we 'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it what about that guy in two thousand and nine i first heard about it 's a movement that it it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone it could really stimulate innovation putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they 've got the best idea of what their needs are so wouldn 't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff do it hands on i thought so so three years ago i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded genspace and the idea was people could come they could take classes none of my previous experience prepared me for what came next can you guess the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next frankenstein instead of getting my scientific papers you got this there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were and this is just the beginning and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor we work in groups in big cities wetware and of course the code of life we like to build things then we like to take things apart the first thing that comes to it really compels you you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups because and they have access to pathogens and they noted not surprisingly that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics ethics as and we hammered out a common code of ethics that 's a lot more than conventional science has done if you 're working with a pathogen and sometimes people ask me well what about an accident well working with the safe organisms that we normally work with the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating like some sort of superbug that 's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the but i 'm not going to plan my life around it i 've and they 're going to post it online for everyone to see there were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion the one i liked the best is someone could download my go back to the lab synthesize some fake ellen dna and plant it at a crime scene study like that far outweighs the risk what would i do in a biolab well it wasn 't that long ago we were asking well what would anyone do with a personal computer so this stuff is just beginning we 're only seeing just the tip of the dna let me show you what you could do right now a biohacker in germany a journalist wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street identified the dog and confronted the dog owner it actually is a japanese beetle and the same kind of technology it 's called dna barcoding it 's really cool you can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat 's in a biohacker space collect microbes see what 's up there you can do a lot of things and they look at social ecological problems from a completely different perspective it 's really cool all over the world"
