  "transcript": "to talk and i 'm at a stage in life where i 'm yearning for my old days so i want to confess to you that when i was a kid now i know what you 're thinking you 're thinking that 's not what the wikipedia reports that this guy this former congressman from erie pennsylvania was at the age of twenty one of the youngest people at the republican national convention but it 's just not true it drives me so nuts let me just change this little but the thing i want you to think about when we think about conservatives not so much this issue of and eighty convention the thing to think about is this they go to church now you know i mean a lot of people go to church i 'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church and i 'm not talking about the god thing i don 't want to get into that you know that 's not my point they go to church by which i mean they hold potluck dinners indeed they sell books about potluck and it 's the very same people leading and not only food these very same people are strong believers in lots of contexts in the limits on the markets they are in many important places indeed they like all of us celebrate this kind of relationship but they 're very keen that we don 't let money drop into that relationship else it turns into something like this they want to regulate those conservatives to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places because they understand there are places for the market and places where the market should not exist where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others they recognize both of these things have to live together and the second great thing about conservatives they get ecology right it was the first great republican president of the 20th century who taught us about environmental thinking teddy roosevelt they first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources and then they began to teach us in the context of innovation economics they understand in that context free they understand free is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well that 's the thing i want you to think about them now i know so here 's exhibit number one i want to share with you my latest julian sanchez a libertarian who works at the for many people evil cato so julian made this video he 's a terrible producer of videos but it 's great content so i 'm going to give you a little bit of it so here he is beginning julian sanchez i 'm going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving larry lessig so what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos this is this fantastic brat pack remix set to they decided they wanted to do san fransisco saw it and san franciscans thought they but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this here 's lesson number one js there 's obviously also something really deeply great about this they are acting in the sense that they 're shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing but it should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone who 's had a sing a long or a dance party with a group of good friends ll or js so that 's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked and it 's not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end it 's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other it 's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art draws from these two points js one remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience the brat pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups ' social and physical worlds ll and then here 's for me the critical key to what julian has to say js it 's about what level of control we 're going to permit to be exercised over our social realities social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture i think it 's important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind if we 're only focused on how to maximize the supply of this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture and for that to happen you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected to enable this kind of innovation as this libertarian tells us between these two creative cultures a commercial and a sharing culture the point is they all of the great disney works were works that mickey mouse himself of course is a remix of the then very dominant very popular steamboat bill by buster keaton this man was a remixer extraordinaire he is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity but then this is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the sonny bono copyright term extension act extending the term of existing copyrights by twenty years so that no one could do to disney what disney did to the brothers grimm now milton friedman who said he would join our brief only if the word no brainer was in the brief somewhere but apparently no brains existed in this place when democrats passed and signed this bill tiny little quibble of a footnote sonny bono you might say was a republican but buy it this guy is no republican icon on the left creator of this character look at read the license anything you add to the mashup music you might add lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free there is no creator here to be recognized the a respect for ownership the respect we should give the creator the remixer the owner the property i think there are lessons we should learn here and for that sharing activity to happen we have to have of fair use that 's number one number two and number three we need to respect the creator the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them right wing nonprofit but of course let me just tie it here the creative commons which is so that we go from a all rights reserved world to a some rights reserved world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely and it explains the vast right wing conspiracy that 's obviously developed around these licenses as now more than three hundred and fifty million digital objects are out there licensed freely in this way well as you all know not many of us believe we do i tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week i created a video which was based on a wireside chat that i 'd given and i uploaded it to youtube i then got this email from youtube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by by the mysterious wmg that matched their content id so i didn 't think much about it and then on twitter somebody said to me your talk on youtube was dmca 'd was that your purpose imagining that i had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the dmca i answered no i didn 't even think about it but then my whole 45 minute video had been silenced but you couldn 't hear anything because it had been silenced so i did what the current regime says i must do to be free to use youtube to talk about fair use i went to this site and i had to answer these questions and then in an extraordinarily bart simpson like juvenile way you 've actually got to type out like i was in third grade again i will not put tacks on the teacher 's chair i will not put tacks on the teacher 's chair interestingly in the last presidential election who was the number one of this system of regulation in online speech john mccain letter after letter attacking youtube 's refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the internet now that was the story of me then my good old days of now when i 'm a little leftist i 'm certainly left handed so at least a lefty and i wonder can we on the left expect to build this ecology of freedom now in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it where even icons of the left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for research the president who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements which effectively lock us into the insane system of that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes you 're out that of course the rest of the world are increasingly adopting not a single example of reform has been produced so here 's the lessons of openness that i think we need to learn openness is a commitment to a it 's a value of the limits in regulation it 's a value respecting the creator maybe we could do a little trade we learn those values on the left and maybe they 'll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the right"
