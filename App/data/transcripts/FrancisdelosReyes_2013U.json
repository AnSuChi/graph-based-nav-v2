  "transcript": "and for the past fourteen years but i 've been studying and teaching about human waste and how waste is conveyed through these wastewater treatment i 've based my scientific career on and again to optimize these and over the years i have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets and i 've been known to sneak into toilets and take my camera phone but along along the way i 've learned that it 's not just the technical side but how many of you are washers and how many of you are wipers i guess you know what i mean and if you 're a newspaper or rags or corncobs and there are one point one billion people whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open but that is really simply and if you 're living in fecal material and it 's surrounding you you 're going to get sick it 's going to get into your drinking water into your food into your immediate surroundings so the united nations estimates that every year there are one point five million child deaths because of inadequate sanitation that 's one preventable death every twenty seconds one hundred and seventy one every hour four thousand one hundred municipalities and cities build infrastructure for example like but there 's a problem when you scale up to tens of thousands and the problem is what happens when the pits are full this is what happens people defecate around the toilet in schools children defecate on the floors and then leave a trail outside the building and start defecating around the building and these pits have to be cleaned and manually emptied and who does the emptying you 've got these workers who have to sometimes go down into the pits and manually remove the contents it 's a dirty and dangerous business as you can see there 's no protective equipment no protective clothing and in some countries like india the lower castes are condemned so you ask yourself how can we solve this and why don 't we just build western style flush toilets for these two and a half billion and the answer is it 's just not possible in some of these areas there 's not enough water there 's no energy and if you don 't build it right you 're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river just like what 's happening in many cities in the developing world because essentially what you 're doing is you 're using clean water and you 're using it to flush so we 've got to rethink sanitation and we 've got to reinvent and i 'm going to argue that to do this you have to employ systems thinking we have to look at the whole transported treated and reused and not just disposal but reuse so let 's start with the human user interface i say it doesn 't matter if you 're a washer or a wiper a sitter or a squatter the human user interface should be clean and easy to use because after all taking a dump should be pleasurable and when we open the possibilities to understanding this sanitation chain then the back end technology the collection to the reuse should not really matter and then we can apply locally context sensitive solutions so we can open ourselves to possibilities and then the fecal material can then be disinfected and again converted to example in some of our research so we can open up all these possibilities if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets and treatment plants i 'm going to argue that governments should fund sanitation infrastructure ngos and donor organizations they can do their best but it 's not going to be enough governments should fund sanitation the same way they fund roads and schools and hospitals and the who has done this study that for every dollar that we invest in sanitation infrastructure we get something like three to thirty four dollars back and this is what they came up with a simple modified screw auger that can move the waste up and now the pit worker doesn 't have to go down into the pit we tested it in south africa and it works we need to make it more robust and we 're going to do more testing and the hope is that as we are rethinking sanitation we are extending the life of these pits so that we don 't have to resort to quick solutions that don 't really make sense i believe we need to stop the practice of lower castes and lower status people going down and being condemned to empty pits it is our moral it is our social and our environmental obligation thank you"
