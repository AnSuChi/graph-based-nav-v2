  "transcript": "it will be built it was a machine that was designed if you know anything about the simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today and you would be correct except for you 'd have the wrong century the first computer was really designed in the not the 1930s and 1940s it was designed and parts of it were prototyped and the bits of it that were built are here in south kensington now i have a great affinity for charles babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture laughter he was a very wealthy man and a sort of part of the aristocracy of britain and on a saturday night in marylebone were you part of the intelligentsia of that period you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree the duke of wellington many many famous people and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines miss that era you know where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you but babbage 18th century and was a fairly famous mathematician he held the post that newton held at cambridge and that was recently held by stephen hawking he 's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of every time he had a good idea he 'd think that 's brilliant i 'm going to start building that one i 'll spend a fortune on it i 've got a better idea i 'm going to work on this one and i 'm going to do this one he did this until sir robert peel then prime minister basically kicked him out of number ten downing street and kicking him out in those days that the thing he designed was this monstrosity here the analytical engine every one of these circles is a cog and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive so as i go through this talk i want you to imagine this gigantic machine we heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like and i 'm going to take you through the architecture and tell you about this thirty cogs high imagine a thing this high of cogs hundreds and hundreds of them and they 've got numbers on them it 's a decimal machine everything 's done so he 's got memory you see it all like this this monstrosity over here is the cpu the chip if you like of course it 's this big this is a picture of a prototype for part of the cpu which is in the science museum division which already is a bit of a feat in metal but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn 't it could compute it couldn 't just calculate it could do more and we think about chips today we can 't look inside a silicon chip it 's just so tiny yet if you did you would see something very very similar to this there 's this incredible complexity in the cpu bit over here which is incredibly complicated and this is a program in the science museum just not far from here and there 's not just one of these there 's many of them he prepared programs so he was just repurposing the technology of the day and like everything else he did he 's using the technology of his who would completely revolutionize transformers all these sorts of things babbage of course wanted to use proven technology so steam and things so if anything went wrong or the machine needed the attendant to come to it there was a bell it could ring and there 's actually an instruction on the punch card which says ring the bell and everyone needs a printer this is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his called the difference engine no two which he never built but which the science museum did build in the ' 80s and ' 90s it 's completely mechanical again a printer but it does print onto paper and it even does word wrapping so to do anything with graphics so he said well i need a plotter i 've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and i 'll make it plot so he designed a plotter as well and you know at that point i think he got pretty much a pretty good machine along comes this woman ada lovelace now imagine these soirees all these great and good comes along this lady is the lord byron and her mother being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of lord byron 's madness and badness thought i know the solution mathematics is the solution we 'll teach her mathematics that 'll calm her down there 's never been a mathematician mathematician that 's gone crazy so and charles babbage you know gets out his machine the duke of wellington is there you know get out the machine obviously demonstrates it and she gets it she 's the only person in his lifetime really who said i understand what this does and i understand the future of this machine and we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that babbage was intending to build some people call her the first programmer this is actually from one of the paper that she translated this is a program written in a particular style she saw something that babbage didn 't and lovelace said you could do more than mathematics on this machine whether it 's video or text or music or voice it 's all numbers it 's all underlying it mathematical functions happening and lovelace said just because you 're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn 't mean these things can 't represent other things in the real world such as music because babbage is there saying we could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs and lovelace is there and she says look this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically she did do some but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much much more than this now a hundred years later this guy comes along alan turing and in and invents the computer all over again now of course babbage 's machine was entirely mechanical turing 's machine was entirely theoretical both of these guys were from a mathematical perspective but turing told us something very important he laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science and said it doesn 't matter how you make a computer it doesn 't matter if your computer 's mechanical or perhaps in the future mechanical again once we get into nanotechnology churchturing thesis only really slowly to give you an idea of how slowly it had about 1k of memory zx81 it did have a ram pack you could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to so where does that bring us today so there are plans over in swindon the science museum archives there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by charles babbage about this analytical engine one of those is a set of plans that we call plan twenty eight and our plan is to build it we will build the analytical the project has a number of parts to it one was the scanning of babbage 's archive that 's been done the second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build the third part is a computer simulation of that machine when it 's built you 'll finally be able to understand how a computer works because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you you 've got to look at this humongous thing and say ah i see the memory operating i see the cpu operating i hear it operating i probably smell it operating laughter but in between that we 're going to do a simulation it will surely guide the future course of science of course he never built it because he was always fiddling with new plans but when it did get built of course in the 1940s now i 'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the cpu mechanism working so and it 's going to add this is the adding mechanism in in action so you imagine this gigantic machine so give me five years before the"
