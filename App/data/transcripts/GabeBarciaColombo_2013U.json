  "transcript": "machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes in limited edition but he is one of the founders of genspace e coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry dna in fact i saw oliver do one of these strawberry dna extractions about a year ago and this is what led me into this bizarre path that i 'm going to talk to strawberry dna is really fascinating because it 's so beautiful i 'd never thought about dna being a beautiful thing before before i saw it in this form i started doing this on and i was at a dinner party with some artist friends and i was telling them about this project and they couldn 't believe that you could actually see dna and i would capture them on video because it created this kind of funny portrait as well these are people who don 't necessarily regularly engage with science tell from their reactions but they became fascinated by it and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science and so i started doing this regularly laughter it 's an odd thing to do with your friday nights but this is what i started doing i started collecting a whole group of of my friends ' dna in small vials and categorizing them this is what that looked like and it started to make me think about a couple of things first this looked a lot like my facebook wall so in a way i created sort of a genetic social network and the second thing was one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like uh why are they numbered is this person more rare than the other one and i hadn 't even thought about that they were just numbered because that was the order that i extracted the dna in but that made me think about but when you open them you have different rarities of the toys thinking of doing paintings of a vending machine the vial of my dna was sitting there and i saw a beautiful collaboration between the strands of dna and the coils of a vending machine so i decided to create an art installation called the dna vending machine here it and it 's selling out pretty well hoping to do another edition pretty soon i 'd like to get it into more of a metro hub like grand central or penn station next to some of the other vending machines in 3d printing or buying caviar from a vending machine will you submit"
