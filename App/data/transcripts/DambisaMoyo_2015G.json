  "transcript": "our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time of course there are other challenges health care disease burdens and pandemics environmental challenges and of course however to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that i 've just elucidated unless and until we solve economic growth and the fundamental question is this how are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the united states and across europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor in a similar vein seventy percent of the population is under the age of twenty five in these countries it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty russia south africa brazil and even china are falling below that seven percent number and in many cases actually regressing economic growth matters with economic growth countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle opportunity and improved living standards without growth countries contract and atrophy not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived economic growth matters powerfully for the individual if the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises coarser and countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries now i know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition there are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what 's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth and looking at the un 's recent statistics and energy and minerals and you worry but i 'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world and more importantly it 's not just economic growth that has been driven very simply put capital and labor are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state it 's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se we 're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors and even this however and we have countries like the unites states which are more market capitalist our efforts to critique the capitalist system however have tended to focus on countries like china that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism particularly those embodied by the united states this is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption it 's increasing income inequality the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many the two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social in order to think about that framing we have to ask ourselves how does capitalism work today very simplistically capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants and only after they 've maximized their utility do they then decide it 's important to provide support to other social contracts but nevertheless this framework this two stage framework i would argue that in particular right leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth for example parents could get paid for doing that the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like mexico brazil and also in pilot programs in new york but there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left leaning policies arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it 's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of china but also we 've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs things albeit small in scale are moving in that right direction tended to blur the lines between government ngos and private sector two very good examples of this are the the advent of the internet has also proven continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic we 're going to have to be more one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology it 's possibly the dominant ideology of our our times what do you say to those and i think that that we 're already having that discussion there 's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people 's success and improvements in living standards and so i think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people 's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world bg so you 're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth but the only way for that happen without is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources do you see that happening dm well i think that i 'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity i think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite scarce and depleting resources that we know today we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world we 've seen the club of rome we 've seen but i think with ingenuity we could see desalination i think we could reinvest in energy so that we can actually get better outcomes and so in that sense i 'm much more optimistic about what humans can do bg the thing that growth and taking a different direction is that you 're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or open minded i think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them it 's no accident that today the largest economy in the world the united states has democracy liberal democracy as it 's core political stance and it has free market capitalism to the extent that it is free deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism which is a completely different model these two countries completely different political models and completely different economic models and yet they have the same income and i think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don 't know bg one last question the cop21 is going on in paris if you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there what would you say be very much about being open minded as you 're aware the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now in copenhagen ' seventy two in stockholm and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement in fact there 's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want what emerging market countries want emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don 't have political uncertainty in the those countries developed countries recognize that they have a real important responsibility not only just to manage their co2 emissions and some of the degradation that they 're contributing to the world but also as trendsetters in r & d but in essence it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they 're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets"
