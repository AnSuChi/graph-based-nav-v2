  "transcript": "some of you have heard the story before but in fact there 's somebody in the audience who 's never heard this story in front of an audience before so i 'm a i used to be a photographer for many years and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists i always hope that when my pictures were they might actually have an effect on a situation instead of just documenting it so and i was so unhappy with the the article that ran afterwards and actually go spend some time with the kids and try to tell their story a little bit better than i thought i had done for time magazine and the pearl buck foundation told me that they worked with a lot of americans who were donating money to help some of these kids and a man told me who ran the pearl buck foundation in korea that there was a young girl who was eleven years old being raised by every time any westerners came to the village she hid the girl and of course i was immediately intrigued i saw photographs of her and i thought i wanted to go and the guy just told me there 's no way this grandmother won 't even you know there 's no way she 's ever going to let you meet this this girl that 's she 's raising i took a translator with me so i said could i sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings and that if i ever did anything to embarrass her she didn 't speak a word of english although she looked very american she could just put up her hand and say stop and i would stop taking so there i was i couldn 't speak a word of korean and this is the first night i met hyun sook her mother was still alive her mother was not raising her her grandmother was raising her and what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were the i had photographed hyun sook was in fact the fifth child that i found to photograph and almost universally amongst all the kids they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of ridiculed picked on and been rejected and korea was probably the place i found to be the worst for these kids and what struck me immediately in was how confident she appeared to be how happy she seemed to be in her own skin and i noticed that she was clowning around when the teachers would ask questions she 'd be the first person to raise hand again not at all shy or withdrawn or anything like the other children that i 'd photographed again the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend 's ears this thing about saying stop this is on the way home and that 's north korea up along the hill this is up along the dmz they would actually cover the windows every night so that light couldn 't be seen because the south korean government has said for years that the north koreans may invade at any time so there 's always this the closer you were to north korea the more terrifying it was very often at school i 'd be taking pictures and she would whisper into her girlfriends ' ears and then look at me and say stop and i would stand at attention and all the girls would crack up and it was sort of a little joke so i could formally thank the grandmother and hyun sook and i said to my translator what 's going on why is she crying why is everyone crying hyun sook to america with you i 'm twenty eight years old and i live in hotels and the joke is it 's the the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented so i asked the translator why she thought she was dying can i get her to a hospital could i pay to she refused any help at all and so when i got outside i actually gave the translator some money and said please go back and see if you can do something and i gave the grandmother my business card and i said if you 're serious i will try to find a family for her and my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child my friends gene and gail had not heard from me in about a year and suddenly i was calling saying i 'm in korea and i 've met this extraordinary girl and i said the grandmother thinks she 's sick but i think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also and i said i 'll pay for the i mean i had this whole sort of picture so anyway i left and my my friends actually said they were very interested in scare the grandmother to death if i actually write to her and tell her that you 're willing to adopt her i want to go back and talk to her but i was off on assignment i figured i 'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother and on christmas day i was in bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram back in those days you got telegrams and the house that i had spent time in was empty it was incredibly cold no one in the village would tell me where hyun sook was because the grandmother had always hidden her from westerners and they had no idea about this request that she 'd made of me so i finally found myung sung and i went to that address and knocked on the door and a man answered the door it was not a very nice area of seoul and she seemed to be in shock she didn 't recognize me there was and this man came to the door and kind of barked something in korean and i said to the translator what did he say and she said he wants to know who you are and i said well tell him that i and she said he says he knows who you are what do you want i said well tell him that i was asked by this little girl 's grandmother to find a family for her and he said i 'm her uncle she 's fine you can leave now and i 'm trying to think what would the hero do in a movie if i was writing this as a movie script so i said listen it 's really cold i 've come a very long way do you mind if i just come in for a minute i 'm freezing so the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor and as we started talking i saw him yell something and and i had this whole mental picture of sort of like cinderella i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful bright happy little child who now appeared to be very withdrawn and i was really appalled and i couldn 't figure out what to do and the more i tried talking to him the less friendly he was getting so i finally decided i said look a family to live with i was very worried about her i made a promise to her grandmother your mother that i would find a family and now i 'm so happy that you 're going to take care of her i said but you know i bought an airline ticket and i 'm stuck here for a week i 'm staying in a hotel downtown would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow and you can practice your english because he told me i was trying to ask him questions about himself and i found two older amerasians a girl and there 's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to america i said i don 't know if it 's the right decision or not but i would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it 's like to walk down the street what people say to you what you do for a living and just i want him to understand what happens if she stays here and we got thrown out of the restaurant they were yelling at him they were and he started yelling at me and i said to the translator ok tell him to calm down saying and she said well he 's saying ' who the hell are you to walk into my house some rich american with your cameras around your neck this is my niece i love her she 's my sister 's daughter who the hell are you to to accuse me of something like this i will fly my friends over here from the united states if you want to meet them to see if you approve of them i just think that she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was again the stupidest thing i could have possibly done because who 's ever good enough for your relative but he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother and they actually take items of clothing and photographs and they burn them as part of the ritual i think february early february and the pictures before were taken in september seventy five children living in his house he had three women helping him take care of these kids and so i suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet father keene to find out how the adoption process worked because i wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much above board so this is on the way down to the orphanage this is father keene he 's just a wonderful guy this is a social worker interviewing hyun sook now i had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this because the grandmother to me appeared to be sort of the village wise woman and the person everybody throughout the day i noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother and i always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village were one of the most respected families in the village and i always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded and insisted that the villagers treat hyun sook with the same respect they treated her hyun sook stayed at father keene 's and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through he actually agreed to the adoption and i went off on assignment and he said the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day she 's telling me that i 'm messy and i have to clean up my room and he said i don 't know who raised her but he said she 's running the orphanage and she 's been here three days this was movie day that she organized where all the kids went to the movies a lot of the kids who had been adopted actually wrote back to the other kids telling them about what their life was like with this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage whose son had been adopted gene and gail started studying korean the moment they had gotten my first letter they really wanted to be able to welcome on the american air force station this may be one of those myth buster things that we 'll have to clear up here in a minute so my friend gene flew over with his son tim gail couldn 't come this is the uncle signing the adoption papers now we went out to dinner that night to celebrate the uncle went back to his family and gene was showing natasha how to use a knife and fork and then natasha was returning the utensil lessons this is the third night we were in korea the first night we 'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us now i 'd been staying in this room for about three months it was a little 15 story korean hotel because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage and the third night we came back we 'd just gone out to dinner where you saw the pictures and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said there 's no other free rooms on your floor tonight so if you want to put the kids five floors below you there 's a room there and gene and i looked at each other and said tim and i slept on the floor natasha got one bed gene got the other kids pass out it 's been very exciting for three days we 're lying in bed and gene and i are talking about how cool we are we said that was so great we saved this little girl 's life we were just like you know ah and we fall asleep and i 've been in this room you know for a couple of months now and they always and then at night about midnight they turn the heat off in the hotel so at about one a m the whole room would be like twenty below zero and i 'd get up i 'd been doing this every night i 'd been there so sure enough it 's one o 'clock room and i hear people shouting outside and i the bars must have just gotten out and i don 't speak korean but i 'm hearing these voices and i 'm not hearing anger i 'm hearing terror i think the hotel 's on fire and now there 's smoke and flames coming by our windows we 're on the eleventh floor so the two of us were just had the l l bean bootlaces and we 're trying to do up his and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds and gene turns around and says we 're not going to make it and there 's smoke pouring through the vents under the doors there 's people screaming i just remember this unbelievable just utter chaos i remember sitting near the bed and i was just so i had two overwhelming feelings one was absolute terror it 's like oh please god i just want to wake up this has got to be a nightmare this can 't be happening please i just want to wake up it 's got to be a nightmare and the other is unbelievable guilt here i 've been playing god with friends ' lives my friends ' son with natasha 's life and this what you get when you try playing god is you hurt people i remember just being so frightened and terrified and gene who 's lying on the floor says man we 've got to soak towels i said what he says then he said do you have gaffer 's tape we put blankets at the bottom of the door we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air and there in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump five people jumped and died other people were were killed by the smoke and there 's this loud thumping on the door after about forty five minutes in all this and people were shouting in korean and i remember i didn 't know who it was i didn 't know what they wanted and natasha it was one of just the most horrifying nights and then twelve hours later we rented a car as we had planned to and drove back to natasha 's village and we kept saying do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire like eight eight hours ago it 's so weird how life just goes so it turned into a dual celebration because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united these are the greenhouse tents this is the elders teaching gene their dances we drank a lot of rice wine we were both so drunk i couldn 't believe it this is the last picture before gene and tim headed back the adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through like so i found out the name of every official on both the korean and american side and i photographed them and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done this is this is father keene with natasha at the bus stop her great aunt at the airport i had a wonderful deal with cathay pacific airlines for many years where they gave me free passes on all their airlines and jeff cowley actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after after meeting natasha this is twenty eight hours later in atlanta it 's a very long flight if you were writing this you 'd say no we 've got to write the script differently this is the first night showing natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts gene and gail know everyone in atlanta they 're the most social couple imaginable so at this point natasha doesn 't speak a word of english other than this is kylie her sister who 's now a this is a deal i had with natasha which is that when we got to atlanta she could take she could cut off my beard she never liked it very much she learned english in three months she entered seventh grade at her own age level pledge of allegiance for the first time this natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up because they would talk to her and she wouldn 't answer and they didn 't realize she didn 't actually speak english very and seemed to be very popular very very quickly now remember the picture how much she looked like her grandmother at the beginning gail a tense moment in the first football game i think and kylie i mean it was almost like kylie was her own child she 's being baptized now a lot of parents when they adopt actually want to erase their children 's history and gail and gene did the complete they were studying korean they bought korean clothes beauty pageant gene 's been restoring this car for a million years jeff was working for canon cameras and this is her first trip back to korea so there 's her uncle this is this is natasha 's wedding day this is sydney who 's going to be three years old today was the first time i 'm actually seeing him give the whole"
