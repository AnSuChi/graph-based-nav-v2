  "transcript": "the new story about climate protection is that not costly but profitable this was a simple sign error because it 's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel as is well known to companies that do it all the time for example dupont sd micro electronics many other firms ibm are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants and they get their money back now the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it it would be expensive or we would have done it already because markets are essentially perfect if of course that were true there would be no innovation and nobody could make any money but the new story about oil is the government doesn 't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil not just incrementally but completely the united states for example can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time led by business for profit because it 's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it this process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness particularly over oil this thesis is set out in a book called winning the oil endgame that four colleagues and i wrote and have posted for free at and it was co sponsored by the pentagon it 's independent it 's peer reviewed and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal now a bit of economic history i think may be helpful here one of the biggest u s industries was whaling and whale oil lit practically every building but in the nine years before drake struck oil in chiefly oil and and gas made from coal to which the whalers had not been paying attention the remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and capitalists and it 's funny it it feels a bit like this now for oil we 've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil and no one had bothered to add them up before so when we did we found some surprising things now there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil both national competitiveness and national security are at risk on the competitiveness front we all know that toyota has more market cap than the big three put together and serious competition from europe from korea and next is china which will soon be a major net exporter of cars how do you think it will take before you can drive home your new maybe a decade according to my friends in detroit china has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap frog technology they 're not going to export your uncle 's buick the point here is these cars are going to be made super efficient the question is who will make them or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars that seems to make more sense the more we face a very obvious array of problems our analysis assumes that they all cost and if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than than countries that don 't have oil and our military get quite unhappy with having to stand they don 't like being in the sands and they don 't like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates now in order to avoid these problems whatever you think they 're worth it 's actually not that complicated we can save half the oil by using it more efficiently at a cost of twelve dollars per saved barrel and then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio fuels and safe natural gas and that costs on average under eighteen dollars a barrel that will save seventy billion in order to do this we need to invest about one hundred and eighty billion dollars half of it to retool the car truck and plane industries half of it to build the advanced bio fuel industry in the process and protect another million jobs now at risk mainly in auto making so that 's a very handsome return then and also to expand choice and manage risk then you might like some light handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic and we figured out ways to do them and can indeed be done administratively or at a state level just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem namely light vehicles here are four four concept cars this muscle car from toyota four hundred and eight horsepower in an ultra light that does zero to sixty in well under four seconds and still gets thirty two miles a gallon i 'll say more later about this and in the upper left a pioneering effort fourteen years ago by gm eighty four miles a gallon without even using a hybrid in a four seater well saving that fuel sixty nine percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about fifty seven cents per saved gallon but it 's even a better deal for heavy trucks where you save a similar amount at twenty five cents a gallon with better aerodynamics and tires and engines and so on and taking out weight so you can put it into payload so you can you can double efficiency with a sixty percent internal rate of return and we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull and flip the market in the airplane business it 's again a similar story where the first twenty percent fuel saving is free as boeing is now demonstrating in its new dreamliner but then the next generation of planes and if you go over the next fifteen years or so to kind of a flying wing with internal engines then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost let me focus a minute on the light vehicles the cars and light trucks because we we all know the most about those probably everybody here drives one and yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan of all the fuel energy you feed so then of the energy that does get to the wheels only an eighth of it percent of the weight you 're moving is the car not the driver less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver this is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car and it 's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels so there 's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter and the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that well then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car and it would cost a lot more to make because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and carbon fiber composites in and it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety here 's a handmade mclaren slr carbon car that got t boned by a golf the golf was totaled the mclaren just popped off and scratched the side panel they 'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later but if this mclaren were to run into a wall at sixty five miles an hour hidden in the front end because these materials could actually absorb six to twelve times as much energy per pound as steel and do so a lot more smoothly and this means we 've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight we could make cars bigger which is protective but make them light whereas if we made them heavy they 'd be both hostile and inefficient and when you make them light in the right way that can be simpler and cheaper to make you can end up saving money and lives and and the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely we figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very because it 's a combination of carbon and nylon into whatever complex shapes you want like the one just because the auto body has only say fourteen parts instead of one hundred one hundred and fifty each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist they snap together like a kid 's toy so you got rid of the body shop and if you want you can lay color in the and get rid of the paint shop those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car so you end up with at least two fifths lower capital intensity which gm has in lansing the plant also gets smaller now when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil including buildings industry feedstocks and so on you find that of the twenty eight million barrels a day the government says we will need about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over at an average cost of only twelve bucks a barrel instead of twenty six for buying the oil and then another six can be made robustly competitively from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio diesel without and here are some no brainer substitutions of it with lots left over so much in fact that after you 've we could of course buy more maybe you ought to buy efficiency at twenty six bucks instead of twelve or wait to capture the second half of it or the ethanol the brazilians would love to sell us but they 'll sell it to japan and china instead because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers and and that doesn 't even count for example that available land in the dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country and the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible now to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence there is a few ways government could help for example fee bates a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles you 're not paid to change size class you are paid to pick efficiency within a size class in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years life cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three this expands choice rapidly in the market and actually makes more money for automakers as well i 'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low income families to get new cars that they could otherwise never get and for each car so financed scrap almost one clunker preferably the dirtiest ones this creates a new market for detroit from customers they weren 't going to get otherwise because they weren 't creditworthy and could never afford a new car and it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities so this is a huge social win too governments buy and we could even do an x prize style golden carrot that 's worth stretching further for for then the legacy airlines can 't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that there are ways to finance it and at the same time to scrap inefficient old if they were otherwise to come back in the air they would waste more oil and block the uptake of efficient new planes those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive we ought to take them out back and shoot them and put bounty hunters after them then there 's an important military role that in creating the move to commercial production of these kinds of materials or for that matter ultra light steels that are a good technology the military can do the trick it did in turning darpanet into the internet just turn it over to the private sector and we have an internet the same for gps the same for the modern semi conductor industry that is military science and technology that they need cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining and shift the and make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster how the whole thing fits together instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up they can turn down with the twelve dollars a barrel efficiency down steeply by adding the supply side substitutions at eighteen bucks and if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil oil in the 2040s and the one thing i 'd like to point out here is that we 've done this before in this when we last paid attention the economy grew twenty seven percent oil use fell seventeen percent oil imports fell fifty percent oil imports from the persian gulf fell eighty seven would have been gone if we 'd kept that up one more year we could rerun that play a lot better now and yet what we proved then is the u s has more market power than opec ours is on the demand side we are the saudi arabia of nega barrels we can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil reason for wanting to do this whether you 're concerned about national security or price volatility"
