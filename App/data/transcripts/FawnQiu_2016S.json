  "transcript": "often using materials that are pretty unexpected my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life for example one time i needed a costume to go to a comic convention so i made my own with a light up crown and skirt another time i was devastated because my favorite mobile game flappy bird was being taken off the app store laughter so i was faced with the dilemma to either never update my phone or never play flappy bird again laughter unhappy with both options i did the only thing that made sense to me i made a physical version of flappy bird that could never be taken off the app store and they told me that it was just as infuriating as the original game and to my surprise it went viral it had over two million views in just a few days and what 's more interesting are people 's comments a lot of people wanted to make it their own or asked me how it was made so this kind of confirmed my idea that through a creative project we can teach people about engineering we were able to let students in our classroom all make their own and they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well i had the idea of using creative engineering projects to teach when i was teaching at a middle school and i noticed that a lot of them seemed bored so i started looking for more creative ways to introduce technology to students what i found was that most technology kits available in school look a little intimidating they 're all made of plastic parts that you can 't customize so that 's certainly not very affordable for most classroom budgets after all we all played with those since we were kids and most importantly they were able to insert their own creativity into and i also started to take these workshops outside of school and into the community and something really interesting happened i noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds started coming to our workshops there were a lot more women and minorities and that you wouldn 't usually see at a traditional engineering workshop now take a look at this employee report at a major technology company in two thousand and sixteen and underrepresented minorities make up only four percent this statistic might look familiar if you walked into a high school robotics club or a college engineering class there 's a wide variety of problems that contribute to perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects i 'm not saying that this could solve everything but it could introduce technology to people who originally wouldn 't be because of how it has been portrayed and taught in school so how do we start to change the perception of technology so i have always designed projects following three principles first is having and that means this project is easy to get started look at this tutorial the first project we asked students to learn is to make a circuit on paper so with so second principle is having a high ceiling this means that there 's a lot of room to grow and students are constantly being challenged at first it might just be a light up creature but then you can add sensors and microcontrollers and start to program the creature to interact with its environment principle is customization this means that flappy bird you can still make your own game the object is to prevent him from getting caught by the lapd"
