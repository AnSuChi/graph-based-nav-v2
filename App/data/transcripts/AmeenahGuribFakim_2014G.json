  "transcript": "you know it 's a big privilege for me to be working in one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world the mascarene islands in the indian ocean these islands mauritius and today i will tell you about five of them and their particular features and why these plants are so unique and the botanical name is and within specific ecosystems often these particular features have evolved as a response to the threat presented by the local in this case grazing tortoises and protects it and of course ensures its survival now the question you the reason for that is that we tend to overlook the diversity and the variety of the natural world we don 't realize how valuable and how precious these resources are and yet through our insouciance we keep on destroying them but when that one last plant or animal for that matter when that very last specimen has disappeared from the face of this earth we would have lost an entire subset of the earth and with it important plants with medicinal potential and here we have a very prime example of the iconic dodo which comes from mauritius and of course we know plants have a fundamental role to play well first of all they feed us because human societies over the millennia they have developed medicinal resources here 's a data point one point four percent of the entire land surface is home to forty percent of the species of higher plants thirty five percent of the species of vertebrates and this one point four percent represents and i study the unique plants on the island for now our work that is the scientific validation of this traditional information has shown that precisely potent activity against a wide range of bacteria that could be pathogenic to humans now could this plant be the answer to antibiotic resistance one thing is certain we will not want this plant to disappear the botanical name is it 's a plant which and we 've managed to bring it back from the brink of extinction by developing in vitro plants which are now growing in the wild now one thing i must point out straightaway is that we are happy in our comfort zone these plants also need their ecosystem to be preserved and yet we know what are the challenges that climate change for example is posing to these plants now the local people again use the leaves in traditional medicine against respiratory our preliminary labwork on the leaf extract has shown that precisely these leaves contain ingredients that are very close in terms of structures chemical structures to those medicines which are sold in the chemist 's shop against asthma so who knows what humanity will benefit from should this plant decide to reveal all i come from the developing world where we are forever being challenged with this issue of population explosion and whenever one talks about population explosion one talks about the issue of food security now this plant here the baobab could be part of the neglected food plant it defines the landscape of west africa now interestingly there are many legends which are associated with this plant because of its sheer size it was meant to be lording over lesser plants hence its particular shape and if you look at this tree again within the african context in west africa it 's known as the palaver tree meeting under the palaver tree with the chiefs or the tribesmen would be synonymous to trying to find a solution to that particular problem and also to reinforce trust and respect among members of the community the one i have showed you is the one from africa you 'll see a white floury pulp which is very rich in nutrients yes you heard right they are looking for this fruit to provide what we know as reinforced food the seeds give an oil a very stable oil which is sought after by the cosmetic industry to give to produce body and the leaves are used in traditional medicine against infectious disease it 's a complete plant and in fact the sheer size of these trees is hiding a massive potential not only for the and the cosmetic industry what i have showed you here is only the species from africa but one thing we know is that the flora is considered to be threatened with extinction let me take you to africa again and introduce you to one of my very favorite now here you 'll find that even jesus has competition which enables it to withstand and yet it can regenerate itself almost especially if you can afford it and this gives you an indication of what the plant looks like but if you water it resulting in wrinkling as we know it especially women we are so conscious of this and this plant in fact is giving the cosmetic chemists very important ingredients that are actually these four examples i have just given you are just a very tiny reminder as to how our health and our survival are closely linked to the health and i know what i 'm talking about coming let me finish with just one last example that is the ones which grow in many different habitats across the world they also need to be considered you know why because the environment plays a very important role in modifying the composition of that plant so let 's take a look at this plant here centella asiatica grows across the world in many different habitats in africa in asia and this plant has been instrumental because and the cosmetic companies are already using it to make regenerating cream now there is an ancient saying you may not believe in ancient sayings you may think they 're obsolete now that our science and technology are so powerful so you may look on centella as being an insignificant it 's a living biological lab that may well have answers to the question that we may have but we have to ensure thank you"
