  "transcript": "this is a river there are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the united states on this map the colored areas represent water conflicts similar problems are emerging in the east as well there are four thousand miles of dewatered streams in montana alone they would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife they 're the veins of the and they 're often empty veins because it 's an archetype it runs through a populated area from east helena to lake helena it supports wild nearly every year it started back in the late but as more people showed up wanting water the folks who were there first got a little concerned there were precedent setting suits in the montana supreme court ruled in a case involving prickly pear that the folks who were there first had the first or senior water rights these senior water rights are key the problem is that all over the west now it looks like this some of these creeks have claims for fifty to one hundred times more water than is actually in the stream they risk losing their water right so it 's not just about the number of people the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don 't use it and i 'm sure you all know this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation 's free and some of you 'll be happy to know that it involves beer they 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use and they 're concerned it 's a national problem but i 'm going to tell you another story from montana and it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of so what can they do about this remaining water footprint these ecosystems are really important to the montana brewers and their customers after all there 's a strong correlation between water and fishing and for some there 's a strong correlation between fishing and beer so the montana brewers and their customers are concerned remember prickly pear up until now business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing remember prickly pear it 's a broken system you 've got a disincentive to conserve because if you don 't use your water right you risk losing your water right well we decided to connect these two worlds the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks in some states but they have no incentive we pay them this individual has made the choice or some portion he can protect the water from other users in the stream this guy 's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems the brewers pay to restore water to the stream it while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them after one hundred and forty years of conflict we it 's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used these transactions create allies we 've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in montana with hotels and tea companies and with high tech companies that use a lot of water in the southwest and when we make these we can and we do turn this into this"
