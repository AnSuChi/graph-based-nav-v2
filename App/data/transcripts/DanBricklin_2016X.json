  "transcript": "how many of you have run a business with a spreadsheet by hand like my dad did for his small printing business in philadelphia a lot less that 's the way it was done for hundreds of years in early one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight i started working on an idea that eventually became visicalc and the next year it shipped running on something new called an apple ii personal computer visicalc was and maybe even were using it steve jobs back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety said that spreadsheets propelled the industry forward visicalc propelled the success of apple more than any other single event steve said if visicalc had been written for some other computer you 'd be interviewing somebody else right now on business desks how did it come about what was it what did i go through to make it be what it was well i first learned to program back in when i was fifteen just a couple months after this photo was taken but through luck and an awful lot of perseverance i was able to get computer time around the i worked on the multics project multics was a trailblazing interactive time sharing system multics i worked on the multics versions of what are known as interpreted computer languages that are used by people in noncomputer fields to do their calculations while seated at a computer terminal i went to work for digital equipment corporation i helped newspapers replace their reporters ' typewriters with computer terminals i 'd write software and then i 'd go out in the field to places like the kansas city star where i would train users and get feedback this was real world experience that is quite different than what i saw in the lab at mit after that i was project leader of the software for dec 's first word processor again a new field like with typesetting the important thing was crafting a user interface that was both natural and efficient for noncomputer people to use i went to work for a small company that made electronic cash registers for the fast food industry but i had always wanted to start a company with my friend bob frankston that i met on the multics project at mit so i decided to go back to school to learn as much as i could about business and in the fall of i entered the mba program at harvard business school i was one of the few percentage of students who had a background in computer programming there 's a picture of me from the yearbook sitting in the front row they often have exhibits and exhibits often have words and numbers laid out in ways that make sense for the particular situation here 's my homework again numbers words laid out in ways that made sense lots of calculations we got really close to our calculators in fact here 's my calculator i went dressed up as a calculator the professor would call on somebody to present the case what they would do is they would explain what was going on and then dictate information that the professor would transcribe onto the many motorized blackboards in the front of the class and then we 'd have a discussion one of the really frustrating things is when you 've done all your homework you come in the next day only to find out that you made an error and all of the other numbers you did were wrong and we were marked by class participation i got to daydream a lot most programmers in those days days worked on mainframes building things like but i had worked on interactive word processing and on demand personal computation instead of thinking about i imagined a magic blackboard that if you erased one number and wrote a new thing in all of the other numbers i imagined that my calculator had mouse hardware on the bottom of it like in a fighter plane and right in the middle of a negotiation i 'd be able to get the answer now i just had to take my fantasy and turn it into reality father taught me about prototyping he showed me mock ups that he 'd make to figure out the placement on the page for the things for brochures that he was printing the act of making a simple working version of what you 're trying to build forces you to uncover key problems and it lets you find solutions to those problems much less expensively so i went to a video terminal connected to harvard 's time sharing system and got to work one of the first problems that i ran into was how do you represent values in formulas let me show you what i mean i thought that you would point somewhere type in some words then type in some and get the result the problem was what should i put in the formula it had to be something the computer knew what to put in and if you looked at the formula you needed to know where on the screen it referred to the computer would ask you to type in a unique name it why not make it be the order in why not instead of allowing you to put values anywhere i the computer could put the row and column in as a name and if i did it like a map and if you had to type the formula in yourself you 'd know what to do restricting you to a grid helped solve my problem but it wasn 't too restrictive you could still put any value any formula in any cell i did more work figuring out exactly how the program was supposed to behave i wrote a reference card to act as documentation it also helped me ensure that the user interface i was defining could be explained concisely and clearly to regular people bob worked in the attic bob bought time on the mit multics system to write computer code on a terminal like this and then he would download test versions to a borrowed apple ii over a phone line using an acoustic coupler and then we would test for one of these tests i aced the case so i said i took this and added this and multiplied by this and subtracted that to be able to show it to the public my dad printed up a sample reference card that we could use as marketing material in june of our publisher announced visicalc to the world in a small booth at the giant national computer the new york times had a humorous article about the conference carefully lettering ' visicalc ' in giant black on yellow all hail but some did in october of we shipped visicalc it came in packaging that looked like this and it looked like this running on the apple ii there 's an awful lot more to this story but that 'll have to wait for another day one thing though harvard here 's that classroom they put up a plaque to commemorate what happened there but it also serves as a reminder that you skills and needs and build prototypes to discover and work out the key problems and through that change the world thank you"
