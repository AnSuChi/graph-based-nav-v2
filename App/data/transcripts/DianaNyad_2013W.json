  "transcript": "the cuban shore looking out at that distant horizon again that i 'm going to make it all the way across that vast dangerous wilderness of an ocean not only have i tried four times but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since one thousand nine hundred and fifty the team is proud it 's an expedition of some thirty people bonnie is my best friend and head handler who somehow summons will that last drop of will within me when i think it 's gone after many many hours and days out there the shark experts are the best in the world large predators below the conditions themselves besides the sheer distance of over one hundred miles in the open ocean the currents and whirling eddies and the gulf stream itself the most unpredictable of all of the planet earth and by the way it 's amusing to me that journalists and people before these attempts often ask me well are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything and i 'm thinking what are they imagining that i 'll just sort of do some celestial navigation and carry a bowie knife in my mouth fish and skin them alive and eat them and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water yes i have a team and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery as is true of any major expedition on the planet and we 've been on a journey and the debate has raged hasn 't it since the greeks of isn 't it what it 's all about isn 't life about the journey not really the destination and here we 've been on this journey and the truth is it 's been thrilling we haven 't reached that other shore the dream was still alive from having tried this in my 20s dreamed it and imagined it the most famous body of water on the earth today was deep in my soul it wasn 't so much about the athletic accomplishment it wasn 't the ego of i want to be the first that 's always there and it 's undeniable but it was deeper it was how much life is there left let 's face it we 're all on a one way street aren 't we and what are we going to do what are we going to do as we go forward to have no regrets looking back and all this past year in training you go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair and you be the critic you be the observer while the brave one gets in the ring and engages and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again but yet isn 't afraid and isn 't timid and lives life in a bold way and the destination was even sweeter than the journey everybody scientists sports scientists neurologists bonnie it just i 'm going to see you through to the end of it so i 'll be there and now we 're there the cuban flag is flying above all my team is out in their boats hands up in the air we 're here we 're here for you you have a dream none of us ever get through this life without heartache and if you believe and you have faith and you can get knocked down and get back up again and you believe in perseverance as a and bonnie grabbed my shoulders and she said let 's find our way to florida and we started and for the next the highs were high the awe i 'm not a religious person but i 'll tell you to be in the azure blue of the gulf stream as if as you 're looking down miles and miles and miles i have a playlist of about eighty five songs and especially in the middle of the night that night because we use no lights lights attract jellyfish lights attract sharks lights attract so we go in the pitch black of the night you 've never seen black this black am because there 's no visual at all and i 'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist i 've got tight rubber caps i don 't hear a thing i 've got goggles and i 'm turning my head fifty times a minute and i 'm singing imagine there 's no heaven doo doo doo doo doo it 's easy if you try doo doo doo doo doo and i can sing that song a thousand times in a row now there 's a talent unto itself and each time i get done with and when i get through the end of a thousand of john lennon 's imagine i have swum nine hours and forty five minutes exactly the seawater you 're not well you 're wearing a and the hypothermia sets in the water 's eighty five degrees and yet you 're losing weight and using calories and as you come over toward the side of the boat not allowed to touch it not allowed to get out but bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and ask me all right i am seeing the taj mahal i 'm in a very different state it 's we kind of have a cardinal rule that i 'm never told how far it is because we don 't know how far it is what 's going to happen to you between this point and that point what 's going to happen to the weather and the currents and god forbid you 're stung when you don 't think you could be stung in all this armor bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning and and she said come here and i came close to the boat and she said look look out there and i saw light and i said it 's going to be soon and she said no those are the lights of key west which for most swimmers would be a long time you have no idea how many 15 hour training swims i had done so here we go and i somehow without a decision went into no counting of strokes and no singing and no quoting stephen hawking on the parameters of the universe i just went into thinking about this dream and why and how as i said when i turned sixty it wasn 't about that concrete that 's the everyday machinations that 's the discipline and it 's the preparation and there 's a pride in that but i decided to think as i went along about as i 've proven you may not get what a tremendous build of character and spirit that you that you lay down what a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons the epic journey is going to be over so many people come up that little tracker on the computer when are you going to do the next one we can 't wait to follow the next one well they were just there for fifty three hours and and so there won 't be another epic journey in the ocean but the point is and the point was that every day of our lives is epic and i 'll tell you when i walked up onto that beach rehearsed what i would say on the beach when bonnie thought the back of my throat was swelling up she brought the medical team over to our boat to say she 's really beginning to have trouble breathing another twelve saltwater the whole thing i just thought in my hallucinatory moment that i heard the word tracheotomy laughter bonnie said to the doctor i 'm not worried about her not breathing if she can 't talk when she gets to the shore she 's going to be pissed off that i had practiced just to get myself through some training swims as motivation it wasn 't like that it was a very real moment with that crowd with my team i didn 't do it we did it and we 'll never forget it it 'll always be part of us the three things i did sort of blurt out when we got there was first never ever give up it what 's the phrase from today from socrates audience to be is to do diana nyad you can chase your dreams at any age you 're never too old could ever do has done it and doubt in my mind that i am at the prime of my life today yeah and the third thing i said on that beach was it looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world and in many ways of course it is it 's a there 's bonnie stoll my buddy the henry david thoreau quote when you achieve your dreams it 's not so much what you get as who you have become in achieving them and i 've been in president obama 's oval office i 've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups such as yourselves i 've signed a wonderful major book contract all of that 's great and i don 't denigrate it i 'm proud of it all but the truth is i 'm walking around tall because i am that bold and i will be every day until it 's time for these days to be done thank you very much and enjoy the conference"
