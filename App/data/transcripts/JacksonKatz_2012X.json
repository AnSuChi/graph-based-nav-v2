  "transcript": "i 'm going to share with you a paradigm shifting perspective that whole range of issues that i 'll refer to in shorthand as i don 't see these as women 's issues that some good men help out with in first and foremost now obviously obviously they 're also women 's issues so i appreciate that but calling gender violence a women 's issue is part of the problem for a number of reasons the first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay right a lot of men hear the term women 's issues and we tend to tune it out and we think i 'm a guy that 's for the girls or that 's for the women and a lot of men literally don 't get beyond the first sentence as a result it 's almost like a chip in our brain is activated and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term women 's issues this is also true by the way of the word gender because a lot of people hear the word gender and they think it means so they think that gender issues is synonymous with women 's issues there 's some confusion about the term gender and let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy so let 's talk for a moment about race in the us when we hear the word race a lot of people think that means african american latino asian american native american south asian pacific islander on and on a lot of people when they hear the word sexual orientation think it means gay the dominant group doesn 't get paid attention to as if white people don 't have some sort of racial identity or belong to some racial category or construct as if heterosexual people don 't have a sexual orientation lacking introspection in fact being rendered invisible in large measure in the discourse about issues that are primarily about us and this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject that is centrally about men and i 'm going to illustrate what i 'm talking about i 'm old school on some fundamental regards i make films and i work with high tech but i 'm still old school as an educator and i want to share with you this exercise that illustrates on the level how the way that we think literally the way conspires to keep our attention off of men this is about domestic violence in particular but you can plug in other it starts with a very basic english sentence john beat mary that 's a good english sentence john is the subject beat is the verb mary is the object good sentence now we 're going to move to the second sentence which says the same thing in the passive voice was beaten by john we 've gone from john beat mary to mary was beaten by john we 've shifted our focus in one sentence from john to mary and you can see john is very close to the end of the sentence well close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain the third sentence john is dropped and we have mary was beaten and now it 's all about mary we 're not even thinking about john it 's totally focused on mary over the past generation the term we 've used synonymous with beaten is battered so we have mary was battered flowing from the others is mary is a battered woman so now mary 's very identity mary is a battered woman those of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field know that they attracted to them why do they keep going back what was she wearing at that party what a stupid thing to do why was she drinking with those guys in that hotel room but one is that our cognitive structure is set up to blame victims this is all unconscious our whole cognitive structure is set up to ask questions about women and women 's choices and what they 're doing thinking wearing and i 'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women it 's a legitimate thing to ask but 's let 's be clear asking questions about mary is not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence we have to ask a different set of questions the questions are not about mary they 're about john verbally and other ways the women and girls and the men and boys that they claim to love what 's going on with men why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today why do we hear over and over again about new scandals erupting in major institutions like the catholic church or the penn state football program or the we hear about it all the time the sexual abuse of children what 's going on with men why do so many men rape women what is going on with men and then what is the role of the various institutions in our society that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates because this isn 't about individual perpetrators that 's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper and more systematic social problem perpetrators are much more normal than that and everyday than that so the question is what are we doing here in our society and in the world what are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce how does all this work and then once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions then we can talk about how we can how can we change the practices how can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes these are the kind of questions that we need to be asking and the kind of work that we need to be doing but if we 're endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking we 're not going to get to that piece today and yesterday and for years and years often get shouted down for their you know what all this is about it 's called kill the messenger it 's because the women who are standing up and speaking out for themselves and for other women as well as for men and boys it 's a statement to them to sit down and shut up keep the current system in place because we don 't like it when people rock the boat we don 't like it when people challenge our power you but one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work is that we can say some things that sometimes women can 't say or better yet we can be heard saying some things that women often can 't be heard saying colleagues and i always say this is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff and by the way one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others who rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow like i said that they 're anti male what about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing against their mother themselves their sisters produces men who abuse other men and if we want to talk about male victims let 's talk about male victims most male victims of violence are the victims of other so we have it in our direct self interest not to mention the fact so there 's so many reasons why we need men to speak out and i just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach because it 's a big thematic shift although there 's lots of particulars but the heart of it is instead of seeing men as women as victims or and there are women who are perpetrators and of course there are men who are victims there 's a whole spectrum but instead of seeing it in the binary fashion and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not so in other words friends teammates but we are embedded in social family work school and other peer culture but how do we not of abuse now when it comes to men and male culture the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are and when i say abusive i don 't mean just men who are beating women we 're not just saying a man whose friend is abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack that 's a naive way of creating a social change it 's along a continuum we 're trying to get men to interrupt each other so for example if you 're a guy and you 're in a group of guys playing poker instead of laughing along or pretending you didn 't hear it we need men to say hey that 's not funny that could be my sister you 're talking about and could you joke about something else or could you talk about something else i don 't appreciate that kind of talk just like i hope that white people would interrupt that racist enactment by a fellow white person just like with heterosexism if you 're a heterosexual person and you yourself don 't enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards people of varying sexual orientations if you don 't say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that then in a sense isn 't your silence a form of consent and complicity well the bystander approach is trying to give people tools to interrupt that process and to speak up to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable not just because it 's illegal but because it 's wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture and if we can get to the place among the many great things that martin luther king said in his short life was in the end what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends in the end what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our hasn 't there there now which is one of the reasons why part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or or college men it should be on adult men with power adult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable for being leaders on these issues because when somebody speaks up in a peer culture and challenges and interrupts he or she is being a leader and i was at this dinner and this woman said to me i think she thought she was a little clever she said so how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the marines i run a leadership program in the in the marine corps now i know it 's a bit pompous my response but it because i don 't believe that what we need is sensitivity training we need leadership training because for example when a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team and i work extensively in that realm as well makes a homophobic statement makes a racist comment there will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio and some people will say he needs sensitivity training other people will say well get off it that 's political correctness run amok he made a stupid statement move on with gender diversity and sexual diversity and racial and ethnic diversity you make those kind of comments you 're failing at your leadership if we can make this point it 's going to change the paradigm of people 's thinking i work a lot in college and university athletics throughout north america there 's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes coaches administrators as part of their educational but you know what 's missing the leadership but it 's not the leadership of student that 's a failure in most cases of men 's leadership look at penn state penn state is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach you had so many situations in that realm where men in powerful positions failed to act to protect which is why we need to encourage men to break through those pressures and one of the ways to do that is to say there 's an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues i know this i work with men and i 've been working with tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of men for many many decades now it 's scary when you but there 's so many men who care deeply about these issues but caring deeply is not enough we need more men with the guts with the courage with the strength with the moral integrity to break our complicit silence and challenge each other and stand with women and not against them we also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didn 't make the choice to we that have a choice i hope that going forward i know we can do it"
