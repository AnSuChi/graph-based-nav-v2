  "transcript": "she 's rooting around she finds this one jacket by balenciaga she loves it she 's turning it inside out she 's looking at the construction her friend says buy it already she said i 'll buy it but i 'm also going to replicate it now the academics in this audience may think well that sounds like plagiarism but to a fashionista what it really is is a sign of prada 's genius that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that doesn 't need to be changed by one iota and to be you might also be asking whether it 's possible that this is illegal for her to do this well but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of all they have really is trademark protection and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room the only thing that they can 't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel that 's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products it 's because it 's a lot harder for knock off artists to knock off these designs because they can 't knock off the logo if you go to santee alley yeah well yeah and sometimes these are fun right now the reason for this the reason that the fashion industry doesn 't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify they didn 't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing and then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because joe blow owns it now those of you who are familiar with the logic logic behind copyright protection which is that without ownership there is no incentive to innovate what i 'm going to argue today is that because there 's no copyright protection in the fashion industry fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design things to cover our there 's a very open and creative ecology of creativity unlike their creative brothers and sisters who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians they 're also now fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry this wedding dress here is actually made of sporks so one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying which is really what it is some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we 're all going to wear now the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most and they 've been faced with a lot of lawsuits but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers the courts have said over and over again you don 't need any more intellectual property protection when you look at well that 's one reason we had a conference here at usc a few years ago we invited tom ford to come the conference was called ready to share he had just come off a successful stint as the lead quite simple research that the counterfeit customer was not our customer johanna blakley imagine that the people on santee alley are not the ones who shop at gucci at least in terms of the materials they 're always made of cheaper materials but even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend there 's lots of virtues of copying one that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader fashion whether you like it or not helps you project who you are to the world they want trends to be set so that they can move product for fashionistas and this let me tell you is very good for the bottom line now of course there 's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process and stuart weitzman is a very successful shoe designer he has complained a lot about people copying him he had to come up with new ideas new things that would be hard to copy he came up with this it 'll actually crack in two it forced him to be a little more innovative and that actually reminded me of jazz great charlie parker i don 't know if you 've heard this anecdote but i have he said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn 't be able to replicate the he wanted to make it too difficult to copy and that 's what fashion designers are doing all the time they 're trying to put together a signature look an aesthetic that reflects who they are when people knock it off this is not unlike the world of comedy i don 't know if you know that jokes also can 't be copyright protected so when one liners were really popular and their jokes much like the fashion designs by now the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they 've learned how to copy themselves they knock themselves off they make deals with the fast the santee alley some fashion designers will say it 's only in the united states that we don 't have any respect in other countries there is protection for our artful designs but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world it turns out that the protection that 's offered is really ineffectual but the novelty standard is so high you have to prove that your garment has never existed and that 's sort of like the novelty standard for a u s patent which fashion designers never get rarely get here in the states in the european union they went in the other direction but even though it 's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there and there 's not a lot of litigation it turns out it 's because the novelty standard is too low a so that does not stop the knock off artists if you look at the registry actually a lot of the registered things in the e u are nike and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs the retailers have kind of quashed this notion though i don 't think the legislation is going anywhere because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that 's just part of a global trend who owns a look that is a very difficult question to answer it takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive you there 's a bunch of other industries that don 't have copyright protection including the food you cannot copyright a recipe because it 's a set of instructions it 's fact and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most it 's too utilitarian magic tricks i think they thought it 'd be more innovative without it they don 't want it it 's not cool they share their designs the rules of games the smell of perfume no and some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you but these are the gross sales for low i p industries industries with very little copyright protection and tell anybody we can actually steal from each other 's designs it 's embarrassing and it 's a model that a lot of other industries like the ones we just saw with the really small bars they might have to think about this because right now those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it 's as if they don 't have any protection and they don 't know what to do when i found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that so i made then it deserves protection the other one is is it an idea is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it the problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed expression versus idea concept nowadays don 't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold it 's a digital file it is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds and these things because we can copy and transmit them so easily actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects the conceptual issues are let me tell you we don 't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out they 're smart but you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out trying to figure out what is the kind of ownership model and my if you want more information about this research project please visit our website it 's and i really want to thank veronica jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation"
