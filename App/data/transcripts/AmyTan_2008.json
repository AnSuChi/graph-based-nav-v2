  "transcript": "the value of nothing out of nothing comes something that was an essay i wrote when i was eleven years old and i got a b + what and i 'm gonna try and do that within the time span that we were told to stay within and to follow the ted commandments that is actually something that creates a near death experience but near death is good for creativity ok so i also want to explain because dave eggers said he was when i say we i don and that includes now in the nature area we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with and some people would say that we 're born with it in some other means and others like my mother would say that i get my material from past lives some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk van gogh syndrome that you have a little bit of you know and that might have caused his spurt of creativity and i don 't i suppose it does something in some part of your brain and i will mention that i actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago but it was during the time i was writing my last book and some people say that book is is quite different who am i why am i this particular person why am i not black like everybody else and it wasn 't bad but it wasn 't really creative because all i could really do was represent in a very one on one way and i have a sense that i probably copied this from a book you know you look at those scores and it wasn 't bad but it was not certainly predictive that i would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words also one of the principles of and i had the usual kind that i think a lot of people had and that is that figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age i have some ones that were long lasting from the age of five to fifteen this was supposed to be my side and it was discovered that my brother and she was gonna fix it and he believed in miracles and that god 's will and after that my mother believed that it was fate or curses there was a reason for everything and one of the reasons she thought was that her mother who had died when she was very young and so i had this notion of death all around me because my mother also believed that i would be next and she would be next and when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon you begin to think very much about everything you become very creative in a and it 's a wonderful way to look at these questions when you write a story because after all in that framework between page one page one and three hundred you have to answer this question of why things happen how things happen in what order they happen what are the influences how do i as the narrator as the writer also influence that and it 's also as the creator of that and you see there 's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen trying to figure it out i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress my looking at associations in practically anything in life and i got a lot of them what 's been going on and so i 'm going to use as the metaphor this association quantum mechanics which i really don 't understand but i 'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor quantum mechanics of course you have dark energy and dark matter and it 's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen there 's a lot of unknown and you often don 't know what it is except by its absence but when you make those associations you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in and that 's what i look for in my work a personal there is also the uncertainty principle which is part of quantum mechanics as i understand it and this happens constantly in the writing and there 's the terrible and dreaded observer effect in which you 're looking for something and you know things are happening simultaneously you 're looking at it in a different way and you 're trying to really look for the about ness or what is this story about and if you try too hard then you will only write the about now i don 't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe like many of our and there are eleven levels i think of anxiety and they all operate at the same time and i have it moral ambiguity it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war and that means because we went into iraq we should stay there not supposed to kill now what 's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors and it is a famous chinese saying because she said it to me i think if somebody really was drowning she 'd save them but both of these sayings saving a fish from drowning or saving a man from drowning to me they had to do with intentions and all of us in life when we see a situation we have a response and then we have intentions there 's an ambiguity and so after that what are our responsibilities what are we supposed to do do we stay in for life or do we do something else and justify and my intentions were good and therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it that is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me and led me to write a book called saving fish from drowning i saw examples of that once i identified this i knew that they had always been there and then writing that 's what happens and i realize that they 've and what i need in effect and you think there 's a sort of coincidence going on a serendipity in which you may be something that is perhaps more serious after a while i had to ask myself why do we take on knowledge why do we take on assumptions that and was hearing these rules of of moral conduct from my father who was a baptist minister so i decided that i would go to burma for my own intentions what the result of that would be if i wrote a book and i just would have to face that when the time came or work at hospitals so what do we do if we have this moral response this feeling also i think one of the biggest things we are all looking at and we talked about today is genocide and i consider what my intentions should be i realize it goes back to this identity question that i had when i was a child and in some sense and yet it is also absolutely necessary in writing a story it is the place where i begin sometimes i get help from the universe it seems my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally from an overdose of opium while having too much of a good time i actually put down in the story that and that actually was the way it happened and my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book in a certain location and i needed to find something historically that would match that and and the kind of character i needed was the taiping rebellion happening in the area near outside of that and a character who thought he was the son of god you wonder are these things random chance what is random and that goes into the story too these are the things i constantly think about another chance encounter is when i went to a place and and then i knew that had to be [ the ] setting of my book and in writing one of the scenes it happened in that third valley for some reason i wrote about cairns stacks of rocks that a man was was building and i didn 't know exactly why i had it but it was so i got stuck and a friend when she asked if i would go for a walk with her dogs that i said sure and about forty five minutes later walking along the beach and i asked him how is it possible to do this and he said well i guess with everything in life there 's a place of i had so many examples i have so many instances like this when i 'm writing a story and i cannot explain it is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain like the cosmological constant what is the nature of accidents and how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a court of law i was and i and i said yes about this village of singing people and they agreed and between the time i saw this place and the next time i went there was a terrible accident a man an old man fell asleep and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm sixty homes were destroyed responsibility was assigned to the family the man 's sons were banished to live three kilometers away in a cowshed and of course as westerners we say well it was an accident that 's not fair it 's the son not the father when i go on a story i have to let go of those kinds of beliefs it takes a while but i have to let go of them and just go there and be there and so i was there on three occasions different and i saw how this had a kind of justice in its responsibility now you as westerners and i as westerners would say well that 's superstition but after being there for a while and seeing the amazing things that happened so i remained with them and the more i wrote that story the more i got into those beliefs and i think that 's important for me years go by of course and the writing it instantly as i 'm trying to convey it to you here but i go back to this question of how do i create and i think it is by questioning and and and coincidences and accidents god 's will and the synchrony of mysterious forces i will come to some notion of what that is how we create i have to think of my role where i am in the universe and did somebody intend for me to be that way or is it just something i came up with and i also can find that by imagining fully and becoming and they have to be in all possibilities including those i never considered before or rather if there an answer it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything and that is good a more complete answer from me it is to simply imagine until there was only there is a transparency between me and the story that i am creating"
