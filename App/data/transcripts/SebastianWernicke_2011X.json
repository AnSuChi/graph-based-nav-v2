  "transcript": "except for me i how on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand ted videos it would actually currently take you over two hundred and fifty hours to do so and i did a little calculation of this the damage to the economy for each one who does this is around here 's my approach to it all if you look at the current situation you have a thousand ted talks now take this together and you end up with two point three million words of ted talks which is about three bibles worth of surely you can put it into something shorter and i also encountered a project called six word memoirs where people were asked take your whole life and please sum this up into six words such as these here found true love married someone else or living in existential vacuum it sucks i actually like that one so if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words you don 't need more than six words for a ted talk we could have been done by lunch here laughter so here are some of the results that i received i think they 're quite nice for example dan pink 's talk on motivation which was pretty good if you haven 't seen it or some even included references to the speakers such as nathan myhrvold 's speaking style or the one of tim ferriss which might be considered a bit strenuous at times preferably involving total strangers and such as please summarize this text for me in six words and i didn 't allow any low cost countries to work on this but 's not possible to summarize each ted talk individually because if you do the math you have a thousand ted talks you pay ten cents each you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks because some of so i thought of a different way by thinking well the talks revolve around certain but give them ten ted talks at the same time and say please do a six word summary for that one i would cut my costs by ninety percent so for $ but it 's actually not because there 's an example by statistics professor hans rosling i guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks he 's got eight talks online and those can basically be summed up into just four words because that 's all he 's basically and when i asked them to summarize the ten ted talks at the same time some took the easy route out they just had some general comment there were others and i found this quite cheeky they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i 'd been too much on google lately i don 't know any ted talk that contains this but oh well in the end however and this is really amazing for each of of those ten ted talk clusters that i submitted i actually received meaningful summaries here are some of my favorites for example for the ted talks about food someone summed this = moving toward unhappiness so here i was i had started out with a thousand ted talks and i had six hundred six word summaries for those actually it sounded nice in the beginning but when you look at six hundred summaries it 's quite a lot it 's a huge list so i thought i probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries and this is exactly what i did so i took the six hundred summaries that i had put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on ted com and asked people to do summaries of those again there were some misunderstandings for example when i had a cluster of all the beautiful talks someone thought i was just trying to find the ultimate jaw dropping ted talk flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer i mean that 's the essence of it all now i wanted to go all the way all the way and i would only pay so i had fifty overall summaries done this time i paid twenty five cents because i thought the task was a bit harder and when i first received the answers and here you 'll see six of the answers i was a bit disappointed because i think you 'll agree they all summarize some aspect of ted but to me they felt felt a bit bland or they just had a so i was almost ready to give up when one night i played around with these sentences and found out that there 's actually a beautiful of a thousand ted talks at the value of"
