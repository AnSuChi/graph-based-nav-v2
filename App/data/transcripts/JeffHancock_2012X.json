  "transcript": "and i 'm not even talking about the american presidential race we have a high profile journalist caught for plagiarism a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they 've pulled it from the of course not all deception hits the news suggests that most of us should have lied let 's take a look at winnipeg how many of you in the last twenty four hours think back have told a little fib a big one how many have told a little lie out there all right good these are all the liars make sure you pay attention to them no that looked good it was about two thirds of you the other third didn 't lie or perhaps forgot or you 're lying to me about your lying which is very very devious this fits with it 's this pervasiveness combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up that has fascinated people throughout history here we have diogenes with his lantern does anybody know what he was looking for we have confucius in the east who was really concerned with sincerity not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk but that you believed in what you were doing i was defending canada 's borders you may think that 's a weapon right there a stamp i used a stamp to defend canada 's borders very canadian of me i learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here in customs one of which was that most of what i thought i knew about deception was wrong and i 'll tell you about some of that tonight but even since just it 's insane almost every aspect of human communication 's been changed and of course that 's had an impact on deception let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we 've been tracking and documenting the sock puppet here 's an example of one my way anybody ever written on my way then you 've also lied we here 's the last each of these is about a relationship and this is a twenty four seven and so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer like the butler used to do between us and the connections to you don 't know where i am or what i 'm doing or who i 'm with and they 're aimed at protecting the relationships these aren 't just people being jerks but i still care about you our relationship is still important the sock puppet isn 't about ambiguity per se here 's r j ellory best seller author in in britain here 's a reviewer online on amazon you might suspect that nicodemus jones is r j ellory he wrote very very positive reviews about himself surprise surprise sock puppet stuff isn 't actually that new walt whitman also did this back in the day before there was internet technology which is the domain of the chinese water army chinese water army refers to thousands of people in china that are paid small amounts of money to produce content it could be reviews it could be propaganda the government hires these people companies hire them all over the place in everything from hotels to whether looking at these three reviews the internet is really making us a deceptive species especially when you think about the astroturfing where we can see deception but actually what i 've been finding is very different from that and let 's put aside the nigerian prince who 's emailed you about getting the forty three million out of the country let 's forget about that guy too let 's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones those are the conversations that really matter one of the studies we do are called diary studies in which we and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media and it really throws people for a loop because we think well there 's no nonverbal cues so why don 't you lie more the phone in contrast the most lies again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most and perhaps because of the butler lie ambiguities i was telling you about which is a social networking site like facebook but for professionals involves the same information as a rsum and what we found to many people 's surprise was that those linkedin rsums were more honest on the things that mattered to employers like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job you know we always think that hey there are these idealized versions people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives i 've thought that many times my friends no way they can be that cool and have good of a one study tested this by examining people 's personalities they had four good friends of a person and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical highly correlated meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality and they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came or the woman that didn 't look at all like her photo well we were really interested in it and so what we did is we brought people online daters into the lab we put them on a scale got their weight ladies loved that and what we found was very very interesting along the y axis the vertical axis is how tall they actually were that diagonal line is the truth line if their dot 's on it they were telling exactly the truth now as you see most of the little dots are below the line in fact they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch we say in the lab as strong rounding up you get to five ' eight and one tenth and boom five ' nine but they always lied by a little bit one of the reasons is pretty simple if you go to a date what explains all these studies what explains the fact that despite our intuitions mine included a lot of online communication really is strange how do we explain this well to do that one thing is we can look at the deception detection literature it and there 's some really compelling findings the first is we 're really bad at detecting deception really percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not that 's really bad why is it so bad well it has to do with pinocchio 's nose if i were to ask you guys what do you rely on when you 're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they 're lying what cue do you pay attention to most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes the eyes are the and you 're not alone around the world almost every culture one of the top cues is eyes maybe their pupils dilate their pitch goes up their body movements change a little bit but not all the time not for everybody it 's not reliable strange the other thing is that just because you can 't see me doesn 't mean i 'm going to lie we lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else 's gain so there are some pathological liars but they make up a tiny portion of the of the population we lie for a reason just because people can 't see us doesn 't mean we 're going to necessarily lie but i think there 's actually something much more interesting and going on here the next big thing for me the next big idea most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between fifty thousand and one hundred thousand years ago that 's a long time ago a lot of humans have lived since then we 've been talking i guess what 's important though is that writing only emerged about five thousand years ago so what that means is that all the people before there was any writing every word that they ever said every in fact even the next big and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until world war ii even the people of the last two most of the words they ever said how many of you anybody do any writing today did anybody write a word in this that is crazy we 're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where we 've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear but we 're in an environment where we 're recording everything what does that mean what 's the next big idea from that well as a social scientist this is the most amazing thing i have ever even dreamed of when they write a fake review they have to post it the other review is real the person stayed there now your task now is to decide which review give you a moment i can tell if you don 't raise your hand how many of you believe that a is the fake all right very good about half and how many of you think here 's the answer you dominated the first group you 're actually a little bit unusual every time we demonstrate this it 's usually about a 50 50 split which fits with the research fifty four percent maybe people here in winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out those cold hard i love it all right so why do i care about this well what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science the first is that liars tend to think about narrative they make up a story who and what happened and that 's what happened here our fake fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing they also used the first person singular i way more than the people that actually stayed there they were inserting themselves into the in contrast the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there their bodies actually entered the physical space they talked a lot more about spatial information here 's how far shopping is from the hotel most people perform at chance at this task our computer algorithm is very accurate much more accurate than than humans can be and it 's not going to be accurate all the time this isn 't a deception detection machine to tell if your girlfriend 's lying to you on text messaging we believe that every lie now every type of lie fake hotel reviews fake shoe reviews your as i said as a social scientist this is wonderful it 's transformational we 're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and everything from love to attitudes because everything is being recorded now but what does it mean for the average citizen what does it mean for us in our lives well let 's forget deception for a bit one of the big and i never look at it but i never look at my at my record at my trace we 're going to see a lot more of that where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote what we said what we did the networked age"
