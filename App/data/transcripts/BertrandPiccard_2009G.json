  "transcript": "i learned a lot of things about ballooning especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world i did with brian jones when i took this picture and on the other side there was a rising sun so you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown you have the for the people who don 't dare to go through the ice there are so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side we have to keep everything under control well the unknown is part of life in that sense ballooning is a beautiful metaphor because in the balloon like in life against what 's happening to us life is a nightmare how do we steer a balloon by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction in life that means but how do we do that how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day and when we drop the ballast overboard we and i think in life it should be exactly like this you know when people speak about pioneering spirit the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast exclamation marks and when we are able to do that what happens life is not anymore just one line going in one direction life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions and pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon but in life itself explore this vertical axis that means explore all the different ways to do all the different ways to behave all the different ways to think i deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics without the trench i deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid if we throw overboard throwing overboard as ballast to well these basically are things i believed in such a long time but actually i had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it it 's clear that it 's not easy to know which ballast to drop and which altitude to take sometime we need friends family members or a psychiatrist well in balloons we need weather men in order to help the balloonist but sometimes it 's very paradoxical the weather man asked us one day to fly quite and when we calculated we thought we 're never going to make it around the world at that speed and i was so proud to have found that jetstream that i called the weather man and i told him hey guy don 't you think we 're good pilots up there we fly twice the speed you predicted and he told me don 't do that go down immediately in order to slow going to do that we don 't have enough gas to fly so slow and he told me yes but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the north pole and then he asked me and this is something i will never forget in my life or slowly in the good direction and this is precisely what fails so not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life cannot last for long and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel forty five thousand kilometers but we were expected to have doubts we 're to have fears and actually this is where the adventure really started when we were flying over the sahara and india it was nice holidays we could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane you cannot go back that 's a that 's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking that 's the moment when you have to motivate we took off with three point seven tons of we landed with forty kilos it would be with no fuel in order to be and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington together with the airplane of charles lindbergh with apollo eleven with the wright brothers ' flyer with chuck yeager 's sixty one it allowed to do all those things there it will not be possible in the future any more it takes too much energy so how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit and this is when the project solar impulse really started to and i think it 's a nice metaphor also for the 21st century but on another level not to conquer the planet or space but rather to improve the quality of life how can we go through the ice of certainty in order to make the most incredible a possible thing what is today completely impossible get rid of our dependency on fossil energy where crazy people are invited to speak so the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane no fuel nobody ever could say in the future that it 's impossible to do it for cars for heating systems for computers and so on and so on well solar power airplanes are not new they have flown in the past but without saving capabilities without batteries which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it in order to spend the night on the batteries it has been made already on remote controlled little airplane models without pilots but it stays an anecdote because the public couldn 't identify to it i think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities that can talk to students talk to politicians during the flight and really make it a human adventure four meters wingspan is not enough you need sixty four meter wingspan sixty four meter wingspan to carry one the batteries flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency and with two hundred square meters of solar power that means a christmas tree a big so the question is how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree we launched the project with my colleague andre borschberg six years ago we have gone through the stages this is the complete structure of the airplane and one month ago we have unveiled it you it 's a real airplane and what 's the goal now the goal is to take off but mainly take off on our own power without additional help without being towed climb to nine thousand meters altitude and there there will be just one goal just one reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty and this is exactly the symbol of our world if our airplane is too heavy if the pilot wastes energy we and in our world if we keep on spoiling wasting our energy resources if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt it 's clear that we 'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem so you see that this airplane is more a symbol i don 't think it will transport two hundred people in the next years and show the example bit like on this picture here this is a painting from magritte in the museum in holland that i love so much and it 's written this is not a pipe this is a symbol of what we can achieve and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard what pleases me very much is that in the beginning i thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood and more and more we 're invited around the world with andre to talk about that project to talk about the symbol of it invited by politicians invited in energy forums to show that it 's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies so through speeches like this one today through interviews through meetings the success will not the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life save energy and this is possible you know with the technologies we have today it leaves or thirty percent for this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team you can just go on subscribe to just be informed of what we 're doing but much more to get advices to give your comments to spread the word that if it 's possible in the air and each time we have and the success will be brilliant in order to see what there is on the other side everyone has his goal has his dreams has his visions"
