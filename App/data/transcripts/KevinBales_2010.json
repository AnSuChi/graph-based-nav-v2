  "transcript": "you know for me the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that i picked up in london it was the early ' 90s i saw this leaflet and it there are millions of slaves in the world today and i thought no way no way and i 'm going to admit to hubris hot shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this so it can 't be true if you teach if you worship in the temple of learning do not mock the gods because they will take you i went out and did a lit review three thousand articles on the key word slavery two turned out to be about contemporary only two they were full of speculation they were anecdotal and i looked very deeply into businesses because this is an economic crime people do not enslave people and i 've got to tell you what i found out in the world in showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew this is not about lousy marriages this is not about jobs that suck this is about people who can not walk away people who are forced to work without pay people who are operating twenty four seven under a threat of violence where is it well yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery but in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can 't find any cases of slavery and you might notice that it 's only iceland and greenland we 're also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction slaves are used to destroy the environment cutting down trees in the amazon destroying destroying the coastal it 's a pretty harrowing linkage between what 's happening to our environment and what 's happening to our human rights it builds up with these one we all know about the population explosion the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last fifty years being numerous does not make you a slave add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world kleptocratic governments disease you we understand how that works in some countries all of those things happen at once like sierra leone a few years ago live in situations where they don 't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute but that doesn 't make you a slave either what it takes to turn a person who is if the rule of law is sound it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable but if corruption creeps in and people don 't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law then if you can use violence if you can use violence with impunity you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery though for a lot of people they come into slavery because someone has asked them this question all around the world i 've been told an almost identical story people say i was home we needed medicine i knew i had to do anything i could to earn some money to support the people i care they climb into the back of the truck they go off with the person who recruits them bang the hammer comes down and they discover they 're enslaved and that is a complete collapse in the price of human beings i just want to share a little clip for you and we 're also joined by brent lawson from lawson frisk securities brent lawson happy to be here d where is your money going this year bl we really like the human being story a lot if you look at a long term chart so that 's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on d michael what 's your take on the people story are you interested michael o 'donoghue oh definitely non voluntary labor 's greatest advantage as an asset is the endless supply not about to run out of people no other commodity has that bl daphne if i may draw your attention to one thing that is that private equity has been sniffing around and that tells me that this market is about to explode micheal bottom line what do you recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy there 's no need to play the market there 's a lot of vulnerable people out there it 's very exciting d exciting stuff indeed gentlemen thank you very much kevin bales okay you figured it out that 's a spoof though i enjoyed watching your jaws drop until you got it mtv europe worked with us and made that spoof and they 've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction which i think is kind of fun here 's the reality capital purchase items you can see that the lines cross the average price of a human being today around the world is about ninety dollars but i could take you places in india or nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or ten dollars they key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups you buy them cheaply you use them you crumple them up so they carry loads of stone on their backs often of their own weight up and down the himalaya mountains but we can 't even seem to die either it 's a horrible situation and if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this it 's that there are also in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved there are ex slaves who are now working to free others i don 't know if you 've ever had a daydream about wow what would it be like to meet harriet tubman what would it be like to meet frederick douglass i 've got to say one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to after escape and james and our emmanuel otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in ghana for enslaving people from the fishing industry for enslaving children everything i 've been telling you i admit is pretty that 's a lot of people but it 's also the smallest fraction of the global population to ever be in slavery and likewise the forty billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor and waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it and get rid of it it 's abetting a crime costs some money that family that three generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery so that granddad there was born a baby into slavery but the total cost amortized across the rest of the work was about one hundred and fifty dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education about four hundred in the united states north america much more expensive legal costs medical costs we understand that it 's expensive here about thirty thousand dollars but most of the people in the world in slavery live in those places and in fact the global average is about what it is for ghana and that means when you multiply it up the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom for the entire people on the planet in slavery is something like ten point eight billion dollars what americans spend on potato chips and pretzels what seattle is going to spend on its light rail system usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans or in the last holiday period when we bought gameboys and ipods and other tech gifts for people we spent ten point eight billion dollars it 's peanuts they take their kids out going to have stuff we 've never had before like three squares that 's important all of that about how we rebuild sustainable freedom because we 'd never want to repeat what happened in this country in decent education any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination and america is still paying the price for the botched emancipation of and end up as second class citizens it 's just not going to happen this is what liberation really looks like children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in ghana reunited with their parents and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well being so that they become absolutely they had just the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines they hadn 't been really pushed back i was frightened we were frightened we said to her are you worried are you upset she said no how could we not succeed she said when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us we have to ask ourselves are we willing to live in a world with slavery if we don 't take action we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy and in our policies and yet if there 's one thing that every human being can agree on i think it 's that slavery should end"
