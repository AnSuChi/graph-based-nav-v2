  "transcript": "i rowed solo across the atlantic and since then i 've done two out of three stages across the pacific from san francisco to hawaii and from hawaii to kiribati tomorrow i 'll be leaving this boat to fly back to kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the pacific cumulatively i will have rowed over eight thousand miles taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than three hundred and twelve days alone on the ocean on a foot rowboat this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean we have a bit of a love hate thing going on but i did respect her and she taught me a heck of a lot so today i 'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they 've taught and how i think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now now some of you might be thinking hold on a minute she doesn 't look very much like an ocean rower isn 't she meant to be about this tall and about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys you 'll notice they 've all got something that i don 't well i don 't know what you 're thinking but i 'm talking about the beards matter how long i 've spent on the ocean i haven 't yet managed to muster a decent beard and i hope that it remains that way the story that i told myself was that adventurers looked like this i thought there were them and there were us and i was not one of them i conformed i did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do i was working in an office in london until i reached my mid 30s and i thought you know and i don 't know what it is but i 'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it so fast forward a few years i 'd gone through some changes to try and answer that question of what am i supposed to be doing with my life i sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary and the one that i was actually heading for but it wasn 't where i and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking or at the end of my life i made a few changes and through a bit of a leap of logic decided to row across the atlantic ocean the atlantic rowing race runs from the canaries to antigua it 's about three thousand miles and it turned out to be the hardest thing i had ever done but what i 'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your and my timing was not great either two thousand and five when i did the atlantic was the year of hurricane katrina and pretty early on those storms started making their presence known all four of my oars broke before i reached halfway across oars are not supposed to look like this so i found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the the boat hook to the to the oars to reinforce it then when that gave out i sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those then when those gave out i cannibalized one of the broken oars i but it 's amazing how resourceful you can become when you 're in the middle of the ocean and there 's only one way to get to the other side and the oars kind of became a symbol of just in how many ways i went beyond what i thought were my limits i suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom i really struggled psychologically totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge realizing that if i carried on moving at two miles an hour three thousand miles was going to take me a very very long time there were so many times when i thought i 'd hit that limit but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how i was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy and to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering i just felt like the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it so this might be a good moment to take a quick time out to answer a few faqs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind number one that i get asked what do you eat a few freeze dried meals but mostly i try and eat much and question number two how do you sleep with my eyes shut ha ha i suppose what you mean is what happens to the boat while i 'm i think my best ever was eleven miles in the right direction worst ever thirteen miles mostly a baseball cap rowing gloves and a smile depending on whether i went backwards overnight and lots of sun lotion do i have a chase boat no i don 't i 'm totally generally i leave that one up to you to judge naturally you decide to row across the pacific but the pacific is really really i think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps i don 't know for sure that the the brits invented this particular view of the world but i suspect we might have done so we are right in the middle whereas if you look in google earth this is how the pacific looks it pretty much covers half the planet you can just see a little bit of north america up here and a sliver of australia down there it is really big sixty five million square miles unfortunately ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line by the time i get to australia if i get i will have rowed probably nine or ten thousand miles in all so because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments the first attempt didn 't go so well in two thousand and seven i did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in twenty four hours a bit like being in a washing machine boat got i blogged about it unfortunately somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving the i lost and got airlifted it was one of the worst feelings of my life as i was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the twenty foot so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation but fall down nine times get up ten but it was not without misadventure my watermaker broke only the most important piece of kit that i have on the boat fortunately help was at hand there was another unusual boat out there at the same time doing as i was doing bringing awareness to the north pacific garbage patch that area in the north pacific about twice the size of texas with an estimated three point five million tons of trash in it circulating at the center of that north pacific gyre so to make the point these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash fifteen thousand empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons they were going and they were starting to sink so they 'd had to pull in and do all the lids up but luckily our courses were converging they were running out of food i was running out of water so we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up and it took about a week for us to actually mahi mahi which was the best food i 'd had in ooh at least three the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier when they opened this one up they found its stomach was full of plastic it leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it so there are very real implications for human health and the following year set out on the second stage of the pacific from hawaii this is big trouble for these guys they 've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level i had a meeting with the president there who told me about his he expects that within the next fifty years the one hundred thousand people that live there will have to and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappear under the waves if the places where i 'd been born and gone to school ungrounded that would make me feel and i try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues to bring a human face to the ocean figuring out how i can use my interesting career choice to be of service and to take some of those things that i 've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in the first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves for so long i told myself that i couldn 't have an adventure because i wasn 't six foot tall and athletic and bearded and then i didn 't sprout a beard something had changed my interior dialogue had changed but what about if we just change that story and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives those sustainable ones we might think that anything that we do as an individual but it does haven 't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters yes there have been the exxon valdezes and but mostly it 's been an accumulation of bad decisions we can start making and when we do that we 're not just one person anything that we do spreads ripples other people will see if you 're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag maybe if we all start doing this we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line that 's just one example this is a world wide community the other point it 's about taking responsibility i wanted something else to make me happy then i could be happy i actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that i needed to create my own future i couldn 't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me and it 's very difficult to be happy on a planet that 's racked with famine and drought it 's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we 've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air so shortly i 'm going to be launching a new initiative called eco heroes and the idea here is that i really believe that we stand at a very important point we have a choice we 've been blessed or cursed and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time"
