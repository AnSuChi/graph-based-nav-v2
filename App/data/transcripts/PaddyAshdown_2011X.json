  "transcript": "a poem written by a very famous english poet at the end of the 19th century it was said to echo in churchill 's brain in the far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by dear to friend soon to die those who are interested in poetry the poem is a shropshire lad written by a e housman but what housman understood and you hear it in the symphonies of nielsen too and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history and all too often and my message for you is that i believe we are condemned if you like and these are and we see it very clearly today nearly always highly turbulent times highly difficult you might argue that the last time it happened and that 's what housman felt coming and what churchill felt too was that when power passed from the old across the atlantic to the new emerging power of the united states of america the beginning of the american century and of course into the vacuum where the too old european powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century we live at one of those times but for us i want to talk about three factors today and the first of these the first two of these is about a shift in power and the second is about some new dimension we have seen lateral shifts of power the power of greece passed to rome and the power shifts that occurred during the european civilizations but we are seeing something within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage the globalization of power we talk about the globalization of markets but actually it 's the globalization of real power and where at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law on the international stage it is not the power of the money changers this times the amount of money necessary for the trade it 's supposed to be there to finance the money changers if you like the the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often countries these live in a global space which is largely unregulated not subject to the rule of law which people may act free of constraint now that suits the powerful up to a moment it 's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint but the lesson of history is unregulated space space not subject to the rule of law becomes populated not just by the things you wanted international trade the internet the things you don 't want the revelation of nine eleven is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth nevertheless those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright september morning you see our enemies also use this space the space of mass travel the internet satellite broadcasters to be able to get around the rule of history is that where power goes governance and if it is therefore the case as i believe it is that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space and i believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim to bring governance to the global space now notice i 'm not talking about government i 'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution but when it comes to governance of the global space my guess is this won 't happen through the creation of more u n institutions it will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty based systems treaty based agreements to govern that global space and if you look you can see them happening already beginning to emerge the world trade organization treaty based organization the g20 we know now that we have to put together an institution and that 's what the g20 is a treaty based institution now there 's a problem there and we 'll come back to it in a minute which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules and that 's a big problem and we 'll return to it in just a second so there 's my first message that then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space and watch that beginning to happen my second point is and i know i don 't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing but you might argue that the story the history of civilizations has been civilizations gathered around seas with the first ones around the mediterranean you already begin to see the development of foreign policies the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing i think actually this is not so much a shift from the west to the east something different is happening my guess is for what it 's worth is but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered it has radically changed we are coming out of fifty years most unusual years of history in which we have had a totally mono polar world in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to washington but that 's not a usual case in history in fact what 's now emerging is the much more normal case of history you 're beginning to see the emergence of a but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi polar world and you begin to see though my own guess is that china 's ascent to greatness is not smooth it 's going to be quite grumpy as china begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her you see increasingly that the world now looks actually for us europeans much more like 19th century a great british foreign secretary lord canning used to describe it as the european concert of if paris got together with berlin britain got together with vienna and rome to provide a counterbalance now notice the warsaw pact a fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances but a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances and that 's the world we 're coming into in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed canning the great british foreign secretary once said britain has a common interest but no common allies beyond the cozy circle of the atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world note it was not good enough for the we had to bring others in we had to bring in this case the arab league in my guess is iraq and afghanistan are the last times and we haven 't succeeded my guess is that we 're reaching the beginning of the end of four hundred years i say four hundred years because it 's the end of the ottoman empire of the hegemony of western power western institutions and western values values you take the last financial crisis after the second world war the west got together the bretton woods institution world bank international monetary fund now we have to create the i suspect we are now reaching the end of four hundred years when western power was enough people say to me the chinese of course they 'll never get themselves involved why not how many chinese troops are serving under the blue beret serving under the blue flag serving under the u n command in the world today eleven the chinese naval contingent of course they are they are a mercantilist nation they want to keep the sea lanes open increasingly we are going to have to do business with but with whom for the moment we share common interests it 's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging and here 's the third factor which is totally different because of the internet because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here everything is connected as nations as individuals in a way which has never been the case before never been the case before but now we are intimately locked together lehman brothers goes down the whole lot collapses there are fires in the steppes of russia food riots in africa and what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone not connected with others not working with others nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory because the effects outside the nation state i was a young soldier in in the last of the small empire wars of britain at that time the defense how strong was our army how strong was our air force how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies now if i want to talk about the defense of my country i have to speak to the minister of health because pandemic disease is a threat to my have to speak to the minister of agriculture because food security is a threat to my security i have to speak to the minister of industry because the fragility of our hi tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies as we see from cyber warfare i have to speak to the minister of home affairs because who has entered my country who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country as we in london saw in the seven seven bombings longer the case that the security of a country it 's its capacity to lock together its institutions and this tells you something very important it tells you that in fact our governments vertically constructed constructed on the economic model of the industrial revolution vertical hierarchy command structures so here is ashdown 's third law by the way don 't ask me about ashdown 's first law and second law because i haven 't invented those yet it always sounds better if there 's a third law doesn 't it ashdown 's third law is that in the modern age where everything is connected to everything the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others the most important bit about your structure whether you 're a government whether you 're an army regiment whether you 're a business but now one final thing if it is the case ladies and gentlemen and it is that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before then it 's also the case that we share a destiny with each other suddenly collective defense the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations is no longer enough it used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe i was safe if my country was more powerful than their country i was safe the advent of i share a destiny with my enemy when i was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the soviet union in geneva in the collective security is not enough peace has come to northern ireland because both sides realized that the zero sum game couldn 't work they shared a destiny with their enemies one of the great barriers to peace in the middle east is that both sides both israel and i think the palestinians do not understand that they share a collective and so suddenly ladies and gentlemen what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages i started with a poem i 'll end with one the great poem of john donne 's send not for whom the bell tolls the poem is called no man is an island and it send not to ask it tolls for thee for john donne a recommendation of morality for us i think part of the equation for our survival thank you very much"
