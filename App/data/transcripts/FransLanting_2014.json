  "transcript": "but i would like to add a voice for the animals it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder and he shared a story with me that is told among his people who call themselves the even though they look different on the outside inside they 're all the same time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity but one day a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw embarrassed the animals fled and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way the ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities all animals are one i like to get past i want to get under the skin no matter whether i 'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog my goal is to connect us with them eye to eye sure no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars you just have to learn how to look past their disguise as a photographer i try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common when i use my i drop my skin like the animals at that cave so i can show who they really are as animals blessed with the power as citizens of a planet in trouble it is our moral responsibility but as humans with hearts we can all rejoice and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave let 's find a way thank you"
