  "transcript": "is a man that most of you have probably never heard about even though he may have been responsible for somewhat mediocre minutes of your life on april nineteen two he may have also been responsible for twenty two very entertaining minutes but not very many of you and all of that goes back to a decision that roy had to make about three years ago so you see roy price is a senior executive with amazon studios that 's the tv production and of course that 's a highly competitive space i mean there are so many tv shows already out there he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here so this curve here is the rating and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating so if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher that 's a winner then you have a top two percent show that 's shows like breaking bad on the left side just for clarity here on that end you have a show called toddlers and tiaras roy price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve because i think you would have to have some serious brainpower to undercut toddlers and tiaras so what he 's worried about is this this middle bulge here the bulge of average tv you know those shows that aren 't really good or really bad they don 't really get you excited so he needs to make sure that he 's really on the right end of this so the pressure is on and of course so he takes a bunch of ideas for tv shows and from those ideas through an evaluation they select eight candidates for tv shows and so when amazon is giving out free stuff you 're going to take it right so so they collect millions and an answer emerges and the answer is amazon should do a sitcom about four republican us senators seems like not too many of you here remember that show actually because it didn 't turn out that great it 's actually just an average show actually literally in fact because the average of this curve here is at seven point four and alpha house lands at seven point five so a slightly above average show but certainly not what roy price and his team were aiming for at another company and he uses data as well to do that except he does it a little bit differently so instead of holding a competition what he did and his team of course was they looked at all the data they already had about netflix viewers you know the ratings give their shows the viewing histories what shows people like and so on and then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience what kinds of shows they like what kind of producers what kind of actors and once they had all of these pieces and they decided to license not a sitcom about four senators but a drama series about a single senator you guys know the show laughter yes house of cards and netflix of course nailed it with that show at least for the first two seasons house of cards gets a nine point one rating on this curve so it 's exactly where they wanted it to be now the question of course is what happened here so you have two very competitive because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time i mean if you 're collecting millions of data points on a decision you 're going to make then you should be able to make a pretty good decision you have two hundred years of statistics to rely amplifying it with very powerful computers the least you could expect is good tv right and if data analysis does not work that way because we live in a time where we 're turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond tv does anyone here know the company because if you do it means you 're in prison and they apply for parole then it 's very likely that data analysis software from that company so it 's the same principle as amazon and mediocre tv twenty two minutes that can be pretty and unfortunately there is actually some evidence that this data analysis despite having lots of data does not always produce optimum results even google gets it wrong sometimes and it worked beautifully and big splash in the news including the pinnacle of scientific success a publication in the journal nature and nobody could even tell exactly why it just didn 't work that year and of course that again made big news including now a retraction of a and despite all those failures data is moving rapidly into now and it goes something like this so whenever you 're solving a complex problem you 're doing essentially two things the first one is you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces and and taking apart and putting back together again and now the crucial thing is that data and data analysis is only good for the first part data and data analysis no matter how powerful can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces there 's another tool that can do that and we all have it and that tool is the brain if there 's one thing a brain is good at it 's taking bits but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back together again and make a show like house of cards that was nowhere in the data ted sarandos and his team and amazon on the other hand they did it the wrong way around they used data all the way to drive their decision making first when they held their competition of tv ideas then when they selected alpha house which of course was a very safe decision for them because they could always point at the data saying this is what the data tells us but it didn 't lead to the exceptional results that that they were hoping for but i believe no matter how powerful data is just tool and to keep that in mind i find this device here quite useful many of you will decision making device to use laughter many of you will know this this toy here is called the magic eight ball and it 's really amazing because if you have a decision to make a yes or no question all you have to do is you shake the and then you get an answer most likely right here in this window in real time i 'll have it out later for tech demos now the thing is of course so i 've made some decisions in my life where in hindsight i should have just listened to the ball but you know of course if you have the data available you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated like data analysis to come to a and i find that a very encouraging message in fact that even in the face of huge amounts of data it still pays off be an expert in what you 're doing and take risks because in the end it 's not data it 's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve"
