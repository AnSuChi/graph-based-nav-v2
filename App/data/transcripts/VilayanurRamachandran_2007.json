  "transcript": "here is this mass of jelly mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space it can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity and this peculiar recursive quality and hopefully someday understand how that happens ok so how do you study this mysterious organ i mean you have one hundred billion nerve cells little wisps of protoplasm interacting with each other there are many ways of approaching one approach what then happens is not and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function so you can then map function onto structure that 's what we 're trying to do so let me give you a few striking examples of this in fact i 'm giving you three examples six minutes each during this talk the first example is an extraordinary syndrome called capgras syndrome if you look at the first slide there that 's the temporal lobes frontal lobes parietal lobes you can still recognize them from their voice and say oh yeah that 's but you don 't really recognize yourself as as yourself ok now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus but there 's another rare syndrome so rare in fact that very few physicians have heard about it not even neurologists this is called the capgras delusion and that is a patient who 's otherwise completely normal comes out of coma otherwise completely normal he looks at his mother and says she 's some other woman pretending to be my mother but when he sees his mother his and that is that this chap and then as you grow up the cortex develops and inhibits and then what happens is there 's a blow to your head damaging the cortex allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge flaming to the surface and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother my mom how come i 'm being sexually turned on she 's some other woman she 's an impostor it 's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain this has never made much sense to me this argument it 's very ingenious as all freudian arguments are but it 's some other dog right now you try using the freudian explanation there you 'll what 's really going on so to explain this curious disorder we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual normally visual signals come in into the eyeballs go to the visual areas in the brain there are in fact thirty areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision and after processing all that the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus right i talked about that earlier now when that area 's damaged you lose the ability to see faces right but from that area the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala gauges the emotional significance of what you 're looking at is it prey is it predator is it mate which you can completely ignore so if the amygdala the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system your heart starts beating faster you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you 're going to so i can determine when you 're looking at something whether you 're excited or whether you 're aroused or not when he looks at his any object for that matter it goes to the visual areas but maybe in this chap that wire that goes from the amygdala this looks like my mother but because the wire is cut to the emotional centers he says but how come if it 's my mother i don 't experience it 's some strange woman pretending to be my mother how do you test this well what you do is if you take any one of you here and put you in front of a screen and measure your galvanic skin response and show pictures on the screen i can measure how you sweat and believe it or not if i show you a picture of your mother you don 't even have to be jewish laughter now what happens if you show this patient you take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response tables and chairs and so so forth but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor it 's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do take a bizarre seemingly incomprehensible by the way if this patient how are you where are you there 's no delusion through the phone then she approaches him after an hour he says who are you you look just like my mother ok the reason is there 's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain so this explains why through the phone he recognizes ok and we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome or a leg is amputated for gangrene or you lose it in war for example in the iraq war it 's now a serious problem you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing and that 's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg in fact you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body believe it or not even with internal viscera i 've had patients with the uterus removed hysterectomy who have a phantom uterus including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month and in fact one student asked me the other day do they get phantom pms ripe for scientific enquiry but we haven 't pursued that now the next question is what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments one of the things we 've found was about half the patients with phantom limbs it 'll answer the phone when it rings it 'll wave goodbye these are patient 's not delusional he knows that the arm is not there but nevertheless it 's a compelling sensory experience for the patient if only i could move it maybe the pain will be relieved now why would a phantom limb be paralyzed it sounds like an oxymoron but when we were looking at the case sheets what we found was and then you get a phantom arm with the same so how do you treat this syndrome now why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb when i looked at the case sheet i found that they had an actual arm and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut and the actual arm had been paralyzed and lying in a sling for several months the amputation and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom when the arm was intact but paralyzed the brain sends commands to the arm the front of the brain saying move but it 's getting visual feedback saying no move no move no move no and we call this learned paralysis ok the brain learns because of this hebbian associative link that the mere command to move the arm this learned paralysis carries over into your body image but give him visual feedback that it 's obeying his command but don 't tell my funding agencies and then you put the phantom so my first patient derek came in he had a brachial avulsion he had a phantom arm excruciatingly painful and he couldn 't move it it was a paralyzed phantom he looks at the phantom being resurrected and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected wiggle your phantom your real fingers or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror he 's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving right that 's obvious but the astonishing thing is the patient then says oh my god my phantom is moving again and the pain the clenching spasm is relieved and remember my first patient who came in look at your reflection of your phantom and he started giggling he says i can see my phantom and then i said close your eyes he closes his eyes and move your normal hand so i said ok this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input going to get a nobel prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb it 's a completely useless ability if you think about it but then i started realizing maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in in neurology like stroke first of all the guy can 't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain i said look derek take it home and practice with it for a week or two maybe after a period of practice you can dispense with the relieve yourself of pain so he i thought maybe the mirror box was gone it 's disappeared i mean i 've changed this guy 's body image what about human subjects ethics and all of that and i said derek does this bother you he said no can you change the design and put it on my forehead so i can you know do this and eliminate my phantom fingers he thought i was some kind of magician now why does this happen it 's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict it 's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back and your motor command saying there is an arm and because of this conflict the brain says to hell with it there is no phantom there is no arm right it goes into a sort of denial it gates the signals and when the arm disappears the bonus so that 's the bonus now this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in helsinki so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain and indeed people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation but it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors this this was discovered by francis galton in the nineteenth century he was a cousin of charles darwin it 's colored c sharp is blue f sharp is green why does this happen this is called mingling of the senses in us all the senses are distinct these people muddle up their senses why does this happen one of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing secondly synesthesia is about and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture which is about creativity synesthesia is eight times what is synesthesia what causes it well there are many theories one theory is they 're just crazy now that 's not really a scientific theory so we can forget about it another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads right now there may be some truth to this because it 's much more common here in the bay area than in san diego let 's ask ourselves what 's really going on in synesthesia all right so we found so we said there 's some accidental cross wiring between color now remember why does this happen why would there be crossed wires and that is there is an abnormal gene a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring so every brain region is wired to every other region and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain so everything is cross connected novelists and poets have in common the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking linking seemingly unrelated ideas such as it is the east and juliet is the sun well you don 't say juliet is the sun does that mean she 's a glowing ball of fire instantly you 've found the links now if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain then it 's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia and hence the eight times more common incidence the last demonstration can i take one minute it here 's what i call martian alphabet just like your alphabet a is a b is b different shapes for different one of them is kiki one of them is bouba which one is kiki and which one is bouba how many of you think that 's kiki and that 's bouba raise your hands well it 's one or two mutants it 's because you 're all doing a cross model synesthetic very important because what it 's telling you but the brain is able to and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain because when that 's damaged these people lose the ability to engage in bouba kiki but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor"
