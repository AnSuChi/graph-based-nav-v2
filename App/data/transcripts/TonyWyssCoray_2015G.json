  "transcript": "this is a painting 16th century from lucas cranach the elder if you drink its water or you bathe in it you will get every culture every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth who spent much of their life chasing the fountain of youth they didn 't find it but what if there was something to it what if there was something to this fountain i will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age related diseases in the future it started with experiments that showed in a recent number of studies about growing that animals old mice that share a blood supply with but what tom rando a stem cell researcher reported in two thousand and seven was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated if it 's exposed to young blood through common circulation this was reproduced by amy wagers at harvard a few years later then showed so what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called and i repeat an old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation looks younger and functions younger in its brain so when we get older we can look at different aspects of human cognition and as i look at the young audience here in the room we 're all still fine diseases such as alzheimer 's and others may develop and there 's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases one big problem we have to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level is that we can 't study the brains in detail in living people but we usually have to wait until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease this is what neuropathologists do for example so how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism so if the body ages or gets sick does that affect the brain and what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood but it also carries carries messenger molecules hormone like factors that transport information from one cell to another from one tissue to and by and large factors that we know are required for the development of tissues for the maintenance so there 's this unbalance of good and bad factors if you will and to illustrate what we can do potentially with that i want to talk you through an experiment that we did we had almost three hundred blood samples from and we measured over one hundred of these so our body lives in a very different environment as we get older when it comes to these factors and using statistical or bioinformatics programs we could discover those factors that best predict age in a way relative age of a person and the way this looks is shown in this graph so on the one axis you see the actual the chronological age so how many years they lived and then we take these top factors that i showed you and we calculate their relative age but what 's really exciting are the outliers as they so often are in life the person i highlighted with the green dot is about seventy years of age but seems to have a biological if what we 're doing here is really true of only about forty five so is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age but more importantly is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age related disease and will have a long life will live to one hundred or more on the other highlighted with the red dot is not even forty but has a biological age of and many other groups are trying to understand what are the true aging factors and can we learn something about them to possibly predict so what i 'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue and that 's where we come back to is done in mice by and that leads then to a shared blood system where we can now ask how does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood and for this purpose we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20 year old people and old mice that are roughly sixty five years old in human years we find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains there 's an increased activity of the synapses the connections between neurons and there 's less of this bad and inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice like us humans they have memory problems it 's just harder to detect them but i 'll show you in a minute how we do that but we wanted to take this one step further one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans and as a control saline and injected it into old mice and asked and to do this we used a test it 's called a barnes maze this is a big table that has lots of holes in the mice hate this and they try to escape and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow so we teach them over several days to find this space on these cues in the space and you can compare this for humans to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping many of us have probably had some problems with that so let 's look at an old mouse here this is an old mouse that has memory problems as you 'll notice in a moment but it didn 't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day in stark contrast and as you noticed it almost looks around where am i and then walks straight to that hole and escapes so it could remember where that hole was so by all means this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated it functions more like a younger mouse and it also suggests that there is something not only in young mouse plasma but in young human plasma that has the capacity to help this old brain so to summarize we find the old mouse and its brain not set in stone we can actually change them it can be rejuvenated young blood factors can reverse aging and what i didn 't show you in this model the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old so there are old blood factors that can accelerate aging and most importantly humans may have because we can take young human blood it does not make the mice younger we 're running a small clinical study at stanford where we treat alzheimer 's patients with mild disease with a pint of do this once a week for four weeks and then we look at their brains with imaging and if that 's the case that could give us hope that what i showed you works in mice might also work in humans now i don 't think we will live forever and if we can turn it back on a little bit maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects thank you very much"
