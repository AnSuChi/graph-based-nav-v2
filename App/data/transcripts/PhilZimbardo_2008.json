  "transcript": "i grew up in the south bronx inner city ghetto in new york and i was surrounded by evil as all kids are who grew up in an inner city and i had friends who were really good kids that is they took drugs got in trouble went to jail some got killed that wasn 't fiction the only question is what was in the juice and more and it was permeable good people could be seduced across that line and under good and some rare circumstances bad kids could recover so i want to begin with this wonderful this wonderful illusion by and as we do what appears is the demons the devils in the world because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition it tells me something else if you remember god 's favorite angel was lucifer apparently it also means the morning star in some scripture and apparently he and when he did and so lucifer descends into hell becomes satan becomes the devil and the force of evil in the universe begins paradoxically it was god who created hell he didn so this arc of the cosmic transformation of god 's favorite angel into the devil so the lucifer effect although it focuses on the negatives the negatives that people can become not the negatives that people are leads me to a psychological definition evil is the exercise of power and that 's the key it 's about power to intentionally harm people psychologically you come up with million hits in a third of a second a few years ago i am sure all of you were shocked as i was with the revelation of american soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war abu ghraib in iraq and these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation i was shocked but i wasn 't surprised because i had seen those same visual parallels when i was the prison superintendent of the stanford prison study what all administrations say when there 's a scandal don 't blame us it 's not the system it 's the few bad apples the few rogue soldiers american soldiers are good usually maybe it was the barrel that was bad but how am i going to deal with that hypothesis i became an expert witness for one of the guards sergeant chip frederick and in that position i had access to the dozen investigative i could study him have him come to my home get to know him do psychological analysis to see was he a good apple or bad apple and thirdly i had access to all of the one thousand pictures that these soldiers took these pictures are of a violent or sexual nature all of them come from the cameras of american they took pictures of everything more than one thousand and they are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all and it all happened in a single place tier 1 a on the night shift why tier 1 a was the center for military it was the interrogation hold the cia was there interrogators from titan corporation all there so they 're going to put pressure on these soldiers military police to cross the line and this is how it was interpreted down to that dungeon by one of the visual and it should not have escaped you that that the reason i paired the prisoner with his arms out with leonardo da vinci 's ode to humanity they had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn 't stink but the guards ended up calling him shit boy what was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution apples well that 's a bad question you have to reframe it and ask what is responsible what could be the who of but it could also be the what of the situation and obviously that 's wrongheaded the main way is called dispositional we look at what 's inside of the person the bad apples this is the foundation of all of social science the foundation of religion the foundation of war social psychologists like me come along and say yeah people are the actors on the stage but you 'll have what 's the costume is there a stage director and so we 're interested in what are the external factors around the individual the bad barrel social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that i discovered when i became an expert witness for abu ghraib the power is in the system the system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals and the system is the legal political if you want to change a person change the situation and to change it you 've got to know where the power is in the system so the lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations what do the my recent book the lucifer effect is about how do you understand how good people turn evil and it has a lot of detail about what i 'm going to talk about today so dr z 's really is a celebration of the human mind 's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or and the good news that i 'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes this wonderful cartoon in the new yorker summarizes my whole talk i 'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop jerome like yourself i 'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not depending on the circumstances there 's a study some of you think you know about but very few people have ever read the story you watched the movie this is stanley milgram little jewish kid from the bronx and he asked the question could the holocaust happen here now and the ad said because it is the key to success ok we we don 't want college we want men between twenty and fifty in the later studies they ran women ordinary people barbers clerks white collar people so you go down one of you will be a learner one will be a teacher the learner 's a genial middle aged guy he gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room the learner could be middle aged could be as young as twenty you press a button on the shock box he doesn 't even feel it that 's the key and as you go along the guy is screaming i 've got a heart condition i 'm out of here who would go all the way to four hundred and fifty volts so milgram asks forty psychiatrists what percent of american citizens would go to the end they said only one percent because that 's sadistic behavior and look at this ninety what about women study thirteen no different than men so milgram is quantifying evil and it 's like a dial on human nature a dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient down to the majority down to none what are the external parallels for all research is artificial what 's the validity in the nine hundred and twelve american citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in guyana jungle in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight because they were blindly obedient to this guy their pastor not their priest their pastor and so he 's the modern lucifer effect a man of god milgram 's study is all about individual authority to control people most of the time we are in institutions stanley milgram and i were in the same high school class in james monroe in the bronx but we wanted college students for a study of prison life personality tests we did interviews picked two dozen the most normal the most healthy i 'm going to put them in a bad situation and secondly we know there 's no difference between the boys who will be guards we didn 't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests cop comes to the front door and knocks and says he 's looking for me so they right there you know they took me out the door they put my hands against was a real cop car it was a real policeman and there were real neighbors in the street who didn 't know that this was an they took me to the basement of the police station then they put me in a cell i was the first one to be picked up so they put me in a cell which was just like a room in this here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out they begin to do degrading activities like having them simulate sodomy you saw simulating fellatio the stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within thirty six hours the study ended after six days because it was out of control five kids had emotional breakdowns does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not if they 're anonymous how do they treat their victims in some cultures they go to war without changing their appearance in others they paint themselves like lord of the flies in some they wear masks in many soldiers are anonymous in uniform so this fifteen do they kill torture mutilate thirteen so what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil uncritical conformity to group norms passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference and it happens when you 're in a new or unfamiliar situation your habitual response patterns don 't work your personality and morality are disengaged psychology is not excuse ology you don 't need it you just need the social psychological processes compare this with this james schlesinger i 'm going to end with this says psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances that 's the lucifer effect and he goes on to say they knew that and let that happen so another report an investigative report by general fay says the system is guilty in this report he says it was the environment that created abu ghraib and because it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time the shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual it doesn 't work aleksandr solzhenitsyn says the line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being waiting for the right situation to come along and i will act heroically my whole life i 'm now going to focus away from evil that i 've been in since i was a kid it 's the counterpoint to hannah arendt 's banality of evil our traditional societal heroes are wrong because they they are the exceptions they organize their life around this that 's why we know their names and the heroic act is unusual and that stopped it was he a hero no they had to put and then his mother and his wife for three years they were in hiding she saw that madhouse and said you know what and you are responsible and i ended the study the next day the good news is i married her the next year i just came to my senses obviously so situations have the power to do things ] but the point is this is the same situation it 's the same situation and you 're on one side or the other most people are guilty of the evil of inaction because your mother said don 't get involved psychology of heroism is we 're going to end in a moment how do we encourage children in new hero hero courses that i 'm working on with matt langdon he has a hero workshop to develop this heroic imagination because you 're always going against the conformity of the group heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary who act the key to heroism is two things you have to act when other people are passive and i want to end with a known story about wesley autrey new york subway hero the subway train is coming and he 's got two the train clearance is twenty one inches a and he said and the moral imperative is i did what everyone should do and so one day you will be in a new situation take path one you 're going to be a perpetrator of evil meaning you 're going to be arthur andersen you 're going to cheat or you 're going to path three you become a hero waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action because it may only happen once in your life and when you pass it by you 'll always know i could have been a hero and i let it pass me so the point is thinking it and then doing it so and let 's focus on the positive advocate for respect of personal dignity for justice and peace which sadly our administration has not been doing thanks so much"
