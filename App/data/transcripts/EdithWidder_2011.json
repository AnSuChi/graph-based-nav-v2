  "transcript": "and it 's not a trip that requires but it 's to a place where of the animals in our ocean but mostly and they were totally i needed some way to share the experience directly and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep rover this next video clip you 're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence and the first thing you 're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across switched off it is possible to see their bioluminescence the light produced when they collide with the mesh this is the first time it has ever been recorded but just to try to prove that fact to you i 've brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible i have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it and you 'll note there 's no light coming from them right now either because they 're dead or because i need to stir them up in some way for you to so that thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away there 's so but it was worth and then everything on this fish lights up it 's unbelievable the light organs under the eyes are flashing that chin barbel is flashing it 's got light organs on its belly that are flashing fin lights it 's phenomenal and you normally don 't get to see this because we 've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets there 's other ways you can for example this shrimp this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this now it may look like a tasty morsel or a pig 's head with wings it puts out a barrage of light in fact a barrage of photon torpedoes i it 's but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean that 's where things get really strange and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in avatar but you don 't have to travel to pandora to see them they 're things like this this is a golden coral a bush which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed any place you brushed against it you get this twinkling that 's just and you see things like this this looks like something out of a dr seuss book just all manner of creatures all over this thing and and it actually ends up looking like it produces these strings of light presumably as some form of defense it produces changing color as it goes from green to blue colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure but we have no idea why it does that here and like the one you just saw it can produce these as bands of light so if i squeeze the base the bands go from base to tip if i squeeze the tip they go from tip to base so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle i 'd be very interested in your theories about what that 's about this is an optical lure that i 've used and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye in the sea that uses far red but as soon as it starts to flash and it 's going to look big because it blooms on the camera i want you to look right here there 's something small there that responds we 're talking to something looks like a little of string pearls basically in fact three strings of pearls and this was very consistent this was in the bahamas at about two thousand feet we basically have a chat room going on here because once it gets started everybody and then finally i want to show you so this scavenger comes in and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish that 's a but if it 's a burglar alarm you wouldn 't expect it to attack but we did see a bunch of responses like this this guy is a little more contemplative wait a minute there 's supposed to be something else there he 's thinking about it and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if i come in from a different angle we are starting to get a handle on this but only just the beginnings we need more eyes on the process so if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible by all means climb it 's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures alien life forms that you don 't have to travel to another planet to see but i warn you thank you"
