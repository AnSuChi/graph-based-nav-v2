  "transcript": "and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light these are chemical clocks and they 're found in every every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell i and you fly it all the way across the continent and you drop it into a sloped cage it will scramble up the floor of the cage and it 'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away and it 's incredible to watch but there 's nothing psychic or paranormal going on it 's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond usually with what 's going on around it and in humans we call it the body clock you can see this most clearly when you take away someone 's watch and you shut them into a bunker deep underground for a couple of months people actually volunteer for this and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole we know that they are working on their own internal clocks rather than somehow sensing the day outside it 's a huge driver for culture well equipped to deal with twelve hours of daylight and twelve hours of darkness so the culture the northern aboriginal culture traditionally has been highly seasonal in winter there 's a lot of sleeping going on you enjoy your family life inside and in summer it 's almost manic hunting and working so what would our natural rhythm look like what would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense well it turns out they go to bed around eight zero p m until midnight and then and in between they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed and during this time there 's a surge of prolactin the likes of which a modern day never sees the people in these studies report feeling so awake during the that they realize and but i believe we should thank you"
