  "transcript": "so since i was here last in ' six we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue so we covered that fairly extensively in skeptic magazine we investigate you will recall i introduced you guys to the quadro tracker it 's like a water dowsing device it 's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around and you walk around and it points to things like if you 're looking for marijuana in students ' lockers it especially if you 're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes well under the category of what 's the harm of silly stuff like this this device the ade six hundred and fifty one was sold to the iraqi government for forty thousand dollars apiece it 's just like this one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction which translates to pseudoscientific baloney would be the nice word in which you string together at trespass points allowing people to go through because your little tracker device actually cost so there is a danger to pseudoscience in believing in we just believe we believe all sorts of things science is not well we all do and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains essentially pattern seeking primates we connect the dots a is connected to b b is connected to c and sometimes a really is connected to b and that 's called we find patterns we make those connections whether it 's pavlov 's dog here in fact what skinner discovered is that if you put a pigeon in a box like this and he has to press one of these two keys and he tries to figure out what the pattern is and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern they will figure out any kind of pattern and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward they repeat that particular pattern sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise once clockwise and peck the key twice and that 's called superstition and that i 'm afraid we will always have with us i call this process tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise when we do this process we make two types of errors a type i error or false positive is believing a pattern is real when it 's not our second type of error is a false negative a type ii error is not believing a pattern is real when it is so let 's do a thought experiment you are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of africa and you hear a rustle in the grass is it a dangerous predator or is it just the wind your next decision could be the most important one of your life well if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it 's just the wind you 've made an error in cognition made a type i error false positive but no harm you just move away you 're more now the problem here is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a type i error is less than the cost of making a type ii error this is the only equation in the talk by the way we have a pattern detection problem especially in and so i think that we evolved there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines our find meaningful patterns that 's a pattern or is it more like a frog see our pattern appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex it 's our little yes there it is and there 's the prime so when i go back just shout out anything you see that 's a good audience chris because there 's nothing in this well allegedly there 's this is an experiment done by jennifer whitson at u t austin on corporate environments and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns that is almost everybody sees the planet saturn people that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this which is allegedly patternless in other words the but not so much when they 're fielding the best batters fail seven out of ten times so their superstitions their patternicities are all associated with feelings of lack of control in this field anybody see an but it 's degraded while you 're thinking about that this was an experiment done by susan blackmore a psychologist in england who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an esp test how much did they believe in the paranormal and so forth and those who scored high on the esp scale tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns here is what you show subjects the fish is degraded twenty percent fifty percent and then the one i showed you seventy percent who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere via the left visual field than the left hemisphere so if you present subjects the images such that it 's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left then they 're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the the left hemisphere our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs so what we 're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens brugger and his colleague christine mohr gave subjects 's a drug as you know given for treating parkinson 's disease which is related to a decrease in dopamine l dopa increases dopamine an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine so dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity in fact neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior things like paranoia delusions and and if you give them drugs that they go away that is you decrease the amount of dopamine and their tendency to see to see patterns like that decreases on the other hand amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists they increase the amount of dopamine so i saw robin williams recently talk about how he he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine when he had that issue than now so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity dopamine i think changes signal to noise ratio that is how accurate we are in finding patterns if it 's too low you 're more likely to make too many type ii errors you miss the real patterns you don 't want to be too skeptical if you 're too skeptical you 'll miss the really interesting good ideas you 're creative and yet you don 't fall for too much baloney too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere every time somebody looks at you you think people are staring at you you think people are talking about you and if you go too far it 's a distinction perhaps we might make between two nobel laureates richard feynman and john nash one sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a nobel prize the other one also but maybe too many patterns and we then call that schizophrenia so the signal to noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem and of course you all know exactly again i 'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here causing you conflicting pattern detections you know of course this is via uno shoes these are sandals pretty sexy feet i must say and of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip flop back and forth it turns out what you 're thinking about a lot influences what of course thanks to the environmentalist movement we 're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals so what you see in this in this particular ambiguous figure is of course the dolphins right and there 's a dolphin and then we have to flip the image for you to see that it 's a set up the impossible crate illusion it 's easy to fool the brain come on shermer anybody can do that in a psych one hundred and one text with an illusion like that well here 's the late great jerry andrus ' impossible crate illusion in 3d in which jerry is standing inside and this board appears to overlap with this one and this one with that one and so on but even when i the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns so what you 're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one but with that one and so your brain is fooled yet again your pattern detection devices are fooled faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes here 's some faces on the side of a rock i 'm actually not even sure if this is this might be photoshopped but anyway the point is still made now which one of these looks odd to you in a quick reaction which one looks odd and you are fairly famous illusion it was first done with margaret thatcher now they trade up the politicians every time well why is this happening well we know exactly where it happens in the temporal lobe right across sort of above your ear there and there 's two types of cells that do this that record facial features either globally or specifically these large rapid firing cells first look at the general face especially when they 're upside down you 're engaging that general facial recognition software there now i said back in our little thought experiment you 're a hominid walking on the plains of africa is it just the wind or a dangerous predator what 's the difference between those and i call this process agenticity that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning intention and agency often invisible beings from the top down dan dennett who talked about taking the intentional stance so it 's a type of that expanded to explain i think a lot of different things souls spirits ghosts gods demons angels aliens intelligent designers government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents and control our lives i think it 's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism it 's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us more moral than us and the narratives always are that they 're coming here to save us and rescue us the intelligent designer 's always portrayed as this super intelligent moral being that comes down to design life even the idea that government can rescue us that 's no projecting somebody up there big and powerful will come rescue us and this is also i think the basis of conspiracy theories there 's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings whether it 's the illuminati or the bilderbergers but this is a pattern detection problem isn 't it some patterns are real and some are not was jfk assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin well if you go there explains a lot maybe and nine eleven a conspiracy theory it is a conspiracy we did a whole issue on it nineteen members of al queda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy but that 's not what the nine eleven truthers think they think it was an inside job by the bush administration well that 's a whole other lecture you know how we know that nine eleven was not orchestrated by the bush administration because continuing on which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there or you can do it through loss of consciousness by accelerating in a centrifuge you get a hypoxia or a lower oxygen and the brain then senses that there 's an out of body experience so i 'm going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together it 's just a minute and a half it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief go ahead and roll it narrator this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm woman we 're hoping we can use part of and these are our models who kissing our models i 'm going to be looking for in this test is"
