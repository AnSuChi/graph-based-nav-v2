  "transcript": "called for tech support again i ignored my boss 's now it 's evening and my dinner i 'm listening to the sounds i think your phone lines are unmanned i punched every touch tone i was told i 've still spent eighteen hours on hold it 's not enough your software crashed my mac and it constantly hangs and bombs it erased my roms now the mac makes the sounds of silence in my dreams i fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys motorcycle crashes blood comes gushing from your gashes with your fading strength but you get me spot the ted presenter who used to be a broadway accompanist the deal was like this you 'll be sent the coolest hottest slickest new gadgets every week it 'll arrive at your door you get to try them out play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out before you have to send them back and you 'll get paid for it so i 've always been a technology nut and i absolutely love it the job though came with one small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column and what i 've noticed is first of all you get an incredible amount of email if you ever are feeling lonely get a new york times column because you will get hundreds and hundreds and the email i 'm getting a lot today is about frustration people are feeling like things but i feel like there 's not enough of a support structure there 's not enough help there 's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support and within twelve hours there were seven hundred messages from readers on the feedback boards on the times website from users saying me too and here 's my tale of woe oh how did that get up there just kidding this is what the computer interface used to look like dos over the it 's gotten easier to use this is the original mac operating system you couldn 't put the mac os x logo in two hundred and eleven k laughter so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to and the calls that you know how they say your call may be recorded for quality assurance uh uh your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd and i have a copy it 's in your gift bag no no with your voices on it so some of the stories are just so classic and yet so understandable a woman called apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking making a squeaking noise and the technician said well ma 'am what do you mean your mouse the faster i move it across the screen and the technician 's like ma 'am you 've got the mouse up against the screen she goes well the message said ' click here to continue ' if you like that one how much time have we got another one a guy this is absolutely true his computer had crashed and he told the technician he couldn 't restart it no matter how many times he typed eleven and the technician said what why are you typing eleven he said the message says ' error type eleven ' so but why is the technical overload crisis but our fingers are essentially staying the same size so it gets to be the mandate to release more and more versions when you buy a piece of software it 's not like buying a vase or a candy bar where you own it it 's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year and every year they say we 've added more features and we 'll sell it to you for $ ninety nine i know one guy who 's spent $ four thousand just on photoshop over the years which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it i mean microsoft word was last just a word processor in you know the eisenhower administration but what 's the alternative microsoft actually did this experiment they said well wait a minute everyone complains that we 're adding so many features let 's create a word processor that 's just a word processor simple pure does not do web pages i call this the sport utility principle people like to surround themselves with unnecessary power but they 're like well i 'll upgrade because i might you know i might need that someday where are you going to stick them you only have so sub menus but if you 're not careful about how you choose you wind up with this this is an this is not a joke un retouched photo of microsoft word the copy that you have with all the toolbars open you 've but all you have to type in is this little teeny window down here and we 've arrived at the age of of interface matrices where there are so many features and options you have to do two dimensions you know a vertical and a horizontal you guys all complain about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically it 's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need i designed the dialogue box no no already we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design microsoft 's approach to simplicity tends to be let 's break it down let 's just make it more steps there 's a new version of windows coming out this fall if they continue at this pace there 's absolutely no telling where they might wind up [ welcome to the type a word wizard so there is a limit that we don 't want to cross but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence but it 's better if you are buying something on the web you 're supposed to put in your address it 's mainly like the united now it would be inconsistent to put united states first but it would be intelligent but why in god 's name do you shut down a windows pc by clicking a button called start here 's another pet one of mine you have a printer so why in god 's name do you see this every time you print it 's like a seven hundred and forty seven shuttle cockpit and one of the buttons at the bottom i 'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the the cult of simplicity palm is also especially in the old days wonderful about this i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the ' 90s and after the talk i met one of the employees and it has to be redesigned ' so i 'm the tap counter so i 'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter when you want to create a new blank document in word you go up to the file menu and you choose new now what happens when you choose new do you get a new blank document you do not on the opposite side of the monitor ok so that is a company you know i don 't want to just stand here and make fun of microsoft yes i do the bill gates song i 've been a geek forever i put my software and together i got profit and they got the loss i write the code that makes the whole world run i 'm getting royalties from everyone sometimes it 's garbage but the press is snowed 'll sell the code every software company is doing microsoft 's r & d you can even windows is a hack we 're kind of so it 's big so it 's slow you 've got nowhere to go i 'm not doing this for praise and i write the code i believe there are really two microsofts there 's the old one responsible for windows and office they 're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can 't they 're locked in because so many add ons and other company stuff locks into the old one thousand nine hundred and but there 's also a new microsoft that 's really doing good simple interface designs i liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch the wireless watch flopped miserably in the market but it wasn 't because it wasn 't simply and beautifully designed but would you pay $ ten a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone and stops working when you leave your area code things are coming out at a faster pace but i had just seen i 'm like where have i seen this before i had just seen the movie evita with madonna and i 'm like you know what i 've got to do one about steve jobs it won 't be easy you 'll think i 'm strange when i try to explain why i 'm back after telling the press apple 's future is black you all that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named woz you try rhyming with garage are i made a fortune i 've still got the they 're gucci leather and because the mac had three percent market share windows had ninety five percent market share people did not think it was worth putting a price on it so i was i was a little depressed and i heard al gore 's talk and i realized i didn 't know the meaning of depressed other products cost less other products had more features they had voice recorders and fm transmitters the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard and there are signs that the industry is getting the message this is a little company that 's done very well with simplicity and elegance physically a really cool elegant thinking coming along lately how do you get the pictures back to your and i fold it in half revealing usb contacts i just stick it in the computer offload the pictures put it right back in the camera i never have to lose anything chris you 're the source of all power will you be my power you walk along and i 'm about to pull this onto the floor i don 't care it 's a loaner here we go whoa it 's magnetic it doesn 't pull the laptop onto the floor lot of my work using speech recognition software and i 'll just you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous and it 's not just what i dictate i also use this feature called voice macros period and having it write out a much longer thing so if somebody sends me a fan letter if somebody sends me hate mail which happens daily i say so the point is this is a really interesting story this is version eight of this software and do you know what they put in version eight no new features it 's never happened before in software the company put no new features they just said we 'll make this software work right because for years people had bought this software tried it out ninety five percent accuracy was all they got which means one in twenty words is wrong and they 'd put it in their drawer but make sure it 's darned accurate and so that 's what they did this cult of doing things right is starting to spread so my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology remember if it doesn 't work it 's not necessarily you ok it could be the design of the thing you 're using be aware in life of good design and bad design and if you 're among the people who create this stuff easy is hard pre sweat the details for your audience simplicity sells"
