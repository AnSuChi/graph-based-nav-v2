  "transcript": "once upon a time there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in but the one thing it lacked was people and so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the and so it was our man presented himself to authorities in the kingdom but then something unexpected happened he wasn 't offered counseling before or after the test which is best medical practice he was picked up and taken to prison including a he was he was taken to the airport and he was deported what on earth did this man do to merit this treatment what was his terrible crime now the kingdom is one of about fifty countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with hiv kingdom argues that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy but these laws when applied to people living with hiv are a violation of international human rights agreements to which these countries are signatories practically speaking these laws drive hiv underground none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport we are very far from the days when the only practical response to dread disease was to have banished the afflicted like this the exile of the leper we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition time for a quick show of hands who here has been touched by hiv wow that 's a significant number of and i 'm not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with but people who are at greatest risk of infection people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners and in many parts of the world that includes women and children who are especially vulnerable these laws treat people touched by hiv with compassion and acceptance these laws respect universal human rights and they are grounded in evidence these laws ensure that people living with hiv and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment counter balanced by a mass of really bad law law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation and they are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance but you know what you don 't have to take my word for it we 're going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law the first is nick rhoades he 's an american and he was convicted under the u s state of iowa 's law on hiv transmission something is against the law then that is telling society that is and i think the severity of that punishment tells you how bad you are as a person you 're a class b felon lifetime sex offender you are a very very very bad person and you did a very very very bad and so that 's just programmed into you and you go through the correctional system and everyone 's telling you the same thing and you 're just like i 'm a very bad person shereen el feki it 's not just a question of unfair or ineffective laws some countries have good the problem is that these laws are flouted because stigma gives unofficial license to treat people living with hiv or those at greatest risk and this is exactly what happened to helma and dongo from namibia our man in the kingdom are among hiv according to recent estimates they 're the lucky ones because they 're still alive according to those same estimates in two thousand and ten one point eight million people died of aids related causes these are terrible and and tragic figures but if but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world on only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it in some parts of the world like here in the middle east and north africa new infections are rising and so are deaths and the money the money we need for the global response to hiv that is shrinking for the first time but in order to do that we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law it 's for this reason that the global commission on hiv and the law of which i 'm a member was established by the agencies of the united nations to look at the ways that legal environments are affecting people living with hiv and those at greatest risk let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference people who inject drugs are one of those groups i mentioned at high risk of hiv through contaminated injection equipment and other risk related behaviors one in every ten new infections of hiv is among people who inject drugs but some countries take a harder line on this than others in thailand people who use drugs or are merely suspected of using drugs are placed in detention centers like the one you see here where they are supposed to clean up ample evidence to show that incarcerating people increases their risk of hiv and other infections we know how to reduce hiv transmission and other risks in people who inject drugs it 's called harm reduction and education and condoms to reduce hiv transmission and also providing hiv testing and counseling and treatment should people become infected australia and switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their hiv epidemics and they have a very low rate of hiv among injecting drug users thailand and russia however have resisted harm reduction and have stringent laws which punish drug use very high rates of hiv among people who are injecting drugs and we 've heard the experiences of over seven hundred people from one hundred and forty countries where you criminalize people living with hiv or those at greatest risk you fuel the epidemic but changing the law isn 't and in fact a number of countries are starting to make progress on a number of points governments and it 's particularly difficult when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex but there 's plenty you can do while that process is underway one of the key points is to reform the police so that they have better practices on the ground so for example outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest we can also train judges so that they find flexibilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of tolerance rather than prejudice we can retool prisons so that hiv prevention and harm reduction is available to prisoners to all this is reinforcing civil society because civil society is key to raising awareness among vulnerable groups of their legal rights and also important is talking to communities so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma for many of us here hiv is not an abstract threat it hits very close to home the law on the other hand can the law begins with us laws that treat people living with hiv or those at greatest risk with respect if we are going to stop the spread of hiv in our lifetime then that is the change we need to spread thank you"
