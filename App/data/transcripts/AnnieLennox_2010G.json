  "transcript": "share with you the story aids campaigner and this is the name of my campaign sing campaign in november of two thousand and three i was invited to take part in the launch of nelson mandela 's forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four foundation that is his hiv aids foundation and forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four is the number that mandela had when he was imprisoned in robben island having the time of my life where he was going to give a conference to the world 's press standing in front of his former prison cell you can see the bars of the window there it was quite a momentous occasion for all of us in that moment in time mandela told the world 's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country that were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims the most vulnerable of all were women and children this was a huge impact on my mind because i am a woman and i am a mother and so i committed when i left south africa i left capetown i told myself this is going to be something that i have to talk about i have to serve and so subsequently i participated in every single forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four event that i could take part in talking and using my platform as a musician with my commitment to mandela out of respect unbelievable work that he had done everyone in the world respects nelson mandela everyone reveres nelson mandela but do they all know about what has been taking place in south africa his country the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the i was very very fortunate a couple of years later to have met zackie achmat the founder of treatment action campaign an incredible campaigner and activist i met him at a forty six thousand six hundred and sixty four event he was wearing a t shirt like the one i wear now this is a tool this tells you i am in solidarity with people who have hiv people who are living with hiv and in a way because of the stigma by wearing this t shirt i say yes we can talk about this issue it doesn 't have to be in the closet it 's a grassroots campaign with eighty percent membership being women most of whom are they work in the field they have tremendous outreach to the people who are living it 's quite extraordinary what they do and yes my sing campaign has supported treatment action campaign in the way that i have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds a lot of the funding that i have managed to raise has gone directly to treatment action campaign and the incredible work that they do and are still continuing to do in south africa so this is my sing campaign sing campaign is basically just me i 've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years i went to about twelve different countries here i am in oslo in norway getting a nice fat check singing in hong kong trying to get people to raise money in johannesburg i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white middle class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips that really touch the heart the whole nature of this terrible tragedy that is taking place that people are tending to avoid because they are fatigued and they really don 't quite know what the solutions are which is absolutely necessary and i was showing them my experiences and and it 's children like this many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the aids virus i 'm sitting here in new york with michel sidibe he 's the director of i 've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by two thousand and and here i am with a pregnant woman who is hiv positive and we 're smiling both of us are smiling because we 're very confident because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she 's about to give birth to and her baby baby will receive it 's one way to start looking at intervention with the aids pandemic now i just would like to finish off to tell you the little story i tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of hiv aids orphans avelile 's mother had hiv virus she weighing no more than a one year old baby at this point in her life she 's suffering with full blown aids and had pneumonia we met her in a hospital in the eastern cape and spent a whole afternoon with her an adorable child the doctors and nurses were phenomenal they put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her and we didn 't know when we left the hospital because we filmed her story we didn 't know if she was going to survive it was obviously it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience this one child you know that story five months later we went back to south africa and i 'm getting they 're standing up because i know what i 'm going to show you this is the transformation that took place isn 't it extraordinary and i take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation i would like to say to you each one in the in the audience if you feel that every mother and you believe that the millennium development goals specifically five and six should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world i think that 's fair to say it 's almost everyone in the hall thank you very much"
