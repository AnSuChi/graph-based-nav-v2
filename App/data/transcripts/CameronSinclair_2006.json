  "transcript": "when i was about twenty four years old kate stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work not only about responding to natural disasters and i was always interested it seemed that i was a black sheep in the family many architects seemed to think that when you design you design a jewel and it 's a jewel that you try and crave for whereas i felt that when you design you either improve but for the community as a whole and i didn 't know what i was doing like i said we put a call out there and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world that led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub saharan africa responding to the hiv aids pandemic that led to we also and we had an exhibit of work that that followed that two thousand and four was the tipping point for us working within the united states most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner but i live in bozeman montana go up to the north plains on the reservations or go down to alabama or mississippi and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that i 've been to so we got involved in in inner cities and elsewhere and also i will go into some more projects two thousand and five mother nature kicked our ass i think we can pretty much assume that two thousand and five was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters and because of the internet and because of connections to blogs and so forth within literally hours of the tsunami we were already raising funds getting involved working with with people on the ground so we began to get involved in projects there and i 'll talk about some others and then of course this year we 've been responding to katrina as well as following up on our reconstruction work so this is a brief overview so we decided to embrace an open source model of business so that anyone anywhere in the world could start a local chapter and they can get involved in local problems because i believe there is no such thing as utopia all problems are local all solutions are local so that means you know somebody who 's based in in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do so what happened is we used meetup and and all these other internet tools and we ended up having forty chapters starting up thousands of architects in one hundred and four countries because i 'm going to do it very quick this isn 't just about nonprofit what it showed me is that there 's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involved in making change i 'm adding that to my time so what you don 't know is we 've these thousands of designers working around the world connected basically by a website and we have a staff of three we did it and so there 's something to be said about navet so seven years later we 've developed so that we 've got advocacy but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy instigation developing ideas with communities and and ngos doing open source design competitions referring matchmaking with communities and then implementing actually going out there and doing the work because so it 's really important that if we 're designing and so here 's a select number of projects this is kosovo in ' ninety nine it led to a whole variety of of ideas and this wasn 't about emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to ten years that would be placed next to the the land the resident lived in this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow it was built it this is a shipping container built and works and a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural so we 've engaged not just designers but also a whole variety of professionals using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes and then something remarkable happened in ' ninety nine we went to africa and it wasn 't doctors telling us this it was actual villagers that we were staying and we started engaging the the medical community and you know we thought we were real bright widely distributed throughout sub saharan africa and the medical community there said we said this for the last decade we know this we just don 't know how to show this so in a way we needs and shown and so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in you get seed and you grow it in a plot of land and and you cut down the clinic and you eat it so it 's dealing with the fact that if you have aids you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea as important as getting antiretrovirals out there so you know this is a serious serious solution this one i love the idea is it 's not just a clinic it 's a community center this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self sustaining project every one of these projects is sustainable it 's because when you live on four dollars a day so you and these ideas developed into prototypes and they were eventually built and currently as of this year there are clinics rolling out in nigeria and kenya the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don 't have education and we 're working in an area where young women between the ages and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that so that there would be a very slow way of developing and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region and then the community picked their design they said this is our design because it 's not only about engaging a community it 's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process out there working with the first ever women 's soccer team in which has now changed to siyathemba i can see chris looking at me this was a connection just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop and we met literally a couple of months ago we 've already developed a design the team is over there working in partnership this was a matchmaking thanks to to a couple of tedsters sun [ microsystems ] cheryl heller and and we start construction in june and it will be opened by tedglobal so when you come to tedglobal you can check it out and we 've been involved in a lot of such as this is a this is a and what that means is we actually live and work with the community and they 're part of the design and then eventually the community here is another school this is what the un un gave these guys for six months twelve plastic tarps this was the replacement that 's supposed to last for two years when the rain comes down you can 't hear a thing and in the summer it 's about one hundred and forty degrees very low cost this was raised by hot chocolate sales it 's built by the parents of the kids the kids are out there on site building the buildings and it opened a couple of weeks ago and there 's six hundred kids that are now using the schools so disaster hits home we see the bad stories on cnn and fox and all that but we don 't see the good stories here is a community that got together and they said no to waiting they formed a partnership this is what they 're cleaning up on their own this is a utility room for a woman who is on a on a walker she 's seventy years old this is what fema gave her it it 's running and she just started a business today where she 's washing other people 's clothes and we 're helping working with them to create a new building projects we 've done projects we 've been a part of support why don 't aid agencies do this this is the un tent this is the new un tent just introduced this year quick to assemble it 's got a flap that 's the invention it took twenty years to design this and get it implemented in the field i was twelve years old there 's a problem here luckily we 're not alone there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work i 'm not sure what they 're smoking this is a grip clip designed by somebody who said all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams this guy designed for for i 'm going to whip through this quickly because i know i 've got only a couple of minutes i showed you something that took twenty years to do and this is just a israel palestine vietnam the average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is thirty two that 's how old i am so it 's a young go use this toilet i 'm sure that 's how he wanted to spend the party but the future is not going to you see crisis what i see is many many inventors one billion people live in abject poverty we hear about them all the time four billion live in in growing but fragile economies one in seven live in unplanned settlements if we do nothing about the housing crisis that 's about to happen in twenty years one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp look left look right one of you will be there how do we improve the the living standards of five billion people so i wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone so chris somehow decided to give me one hundred thousand so why not this many people architecture is the way to go you have a diverse community of participants and we 're not just talking about inventors and designers but we 're talking about the funding model my role is not as a designer it 's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world and what we need is because i haven 't slept in seven years but they don 't want some company in the west taking their idea and basically profiting from it so creative commons has developed the developing nations license and what that means is that a designer can the siyathemba project i showed was the first ever building to have a creative commons license on it as soon as that is built anyone in africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free we want to have a community where you can upload ideas and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake in flood in all sorts of austere that 's too late we need to do it now so doing that globally and i want this whole thing to work so i want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development the idea of needs based competitions xprize for the other ninety eight percent if you want to call it that we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together and the idea of integrating manufacturers fab labs in every country put one in every favela every slum settlement so let 's take those ideas adapt and we can use them these ideas are supposed to be adaptable what will it take there should be a sheet i don 't have time to read this because i 'm going to be yanked off ca let 's just leave it up for a sec cs well what will it take because i want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in in developing these designs but utilize the designs also a process of reviewing the designs i want every arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we 're doing stuff that 's standing because those guys are the best in the world and so if i drop that laptop easy to use easy to get ahold of my mom once said all mouth and no trousers we 've changed international response based on building things so for me it 's important that we create a real conduit but i think i think the man was so let 's do it"
