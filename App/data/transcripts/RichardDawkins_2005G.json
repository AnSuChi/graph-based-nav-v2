  "transcript": "but queerer than i suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of or can be dreamed of in any philosophy richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories experimental predictions to specifying the width of north america to within one hair 's breadth of accuracy yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even feynman himself was moved to remark if you think you understand quantum theory you don 't understand quantum theory who 's talking here because the worst that you can say about it is that it 's preposterously wasteful it postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel mutually undetectable and that 's richard feynman science as opposed to technology does violence to common sense every time you drink a glass of water he points out odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of oliver cromwell it 's just elementary probability theory the number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls or bladdersful in the world and of course there 's nothing special about cromwell or bladders you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree queerer than we can suppose are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence are there things about the universe that are in principle ungraspable however superior we 're now so used to the idea that the earth spins rather than the sun moves across the sky it 's hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must have been after all it seems obvious that the earth is large and motionless the sun small and mobile but it 's worth recalling wittgenstein 's remark on the subject tell me he asked a friend rather than that the earth was rotating and his friend replied well obviously because it just looks as though the sun is going round the earth wittgenstein replied well what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the earth was rotating us against all intuition that apparently solid things like crystals and rocks are really almost entirely composed of empty space and the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium so it would seem the hardest why then do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable as an evolutionary biologist i 'd say this our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other it 's therefore useful because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle sized world in which we have to navigate moving to the other end of the scale our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos i want to give the name to the medium scaled environment in which we 've evolved the ability to take act nothing to do with middle earth middle world we are evolved denizens of middle world and that limits what we are capable of imagining we find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other middle world objects move and hits another middle world object like a rock it knocks itself out may i introduce major general albert stubblebine iii commander of military intelligence in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three [ he ] stared at his wall in arlington virginia and decided to do it as frightening as the prospect was he was going into the he stood up and moved out from behind his desk ' what is the atom mostly made of ' he thought ' space ' he started walking ' what am i mostly made of atoms ' he quickened his pace almost to a jog now ' general stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office stubblebine who commanded sixteen thousand soldiers who would screw around with an army that could do that that 's from an article in playboy which i was reading the other day i was reading playboy because i myself had an article in it unaided constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules it would be different but we but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension douglas adams is on the right steve grand in his book creation life and how to make it is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself we have this tendency to think that only solid material things are really things at all but we find real matter comforting only because we 've evolved to survive in middle world matter a whirlpool for steve grand is a thing with just as much reality as a rock in a desert plain in tanzania the beautiful thing is that it it retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns what happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope on the other side and then as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge it cascades down on the inside of the crescent and so the whole steve grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing he invites us the reader to think of an experience from your childhood something you remember clearly something you can see feel maybe even smell as if after all you really were there at the time weren 't you but here is the bombshell you weren 't there not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you whatever you are therefore you are not the stuff of which you are made if that doesn 't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck read it again until it does because it is important so really isn 't a word that we should use with simple confidence if a neutrino had a brain which it evolved in neutrino sized and because different species live in different worlds there will be a discomforting variety of reallys but constructed so it 's useful for dealing with the real world the nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are a flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking climbing or swimming animal a monkey 's brain must have software capable of simulating a three dimensional world of branches and trunks a mole 's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use strider 's brain doesn 't need 3d software at all since it lives on the surface of the pond in an edwin abbott flatland i 've speculated that bats may see color with their ears the world model that a bat needs in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird a day flying bird like a swallow needs to the fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model while the swallow uses light is incidental for some useful aspect of echoes perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces furry or smooth and so on in the same way as swallows or indeed we use those perceived hues redness and blueness etc to label long and short wavelengths of light there 's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength rather than by the sensory modality involved j b s haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes now a dog that had never met capric acid would perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell oriented animals smell in color and the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats middle world the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with we 're blind to all frequencies outside that unless we use instruments to to help us middle world is the narrow range of reality which we judge to as opposed to the queerness of the very small the very large and the very fast nothing is totally impossible miracles are just events that are extremely improbable and because there 's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement stays rock steady but the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time and again and again in this case the hand would move and we 'd see it waving at us in middle world you still would not have written enough zeros to this day evolution in middle world has not equipped us to handle very improbable events we don 't live long enough in the vastness of astronomical space and geological time that which seems impossible in middle world might turn out to be inevitable one way to think about that is by counting planets we don 't know how many planets there and that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life 's improbability we could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at life could originate once per planet could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe in which case it would have to be here and somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince and similar magical like that if life has arisen and that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it we 're allowed how shall we interpret queerer than we can suppose given the limitations of our brain 's evolutionary apprenticeship in middle emancipate ourselves from middle world and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood which had a make believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the so that they became familiar on the middle world scale of the stream a relativistic computer game in which objects on the screen manifest the lorentz contraction and so on i want to end by applying the idea of middle world to our perceptions of each other most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind we 're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are our hormones are the way they are we 'd be different our characters would be different if our if we were child murderer should be something like this unit has a faulty component it needs repairing that 's not what we say what we say and i include prison is too good for you or worse we seek revenge in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle which we see of course all over the world today we behave more like basil fawlty who thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn 't start on gourmet night the reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface we swim through a sea of people we are evolved to second guess the behavior of others by becoming but it 's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next guilt personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such brilliantly successful way to model humans it 's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we 're trying to think about entities for which it 's not appropriate like basil fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole if the universe is queerer than we can suppose is it just because we 've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the pleistocene of africa or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution or finally are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy thank you very much"
