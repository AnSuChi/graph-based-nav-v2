  "transcript": "in india we have these huge families i bet a lot of you all must have heard about it my parents used to drag me to these family but the one thing that i always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins making us kids have the time of our lives he was diagnosed with parkinson which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee because of tremors much more difficult my uncle started using a walker to walk and to take a turn he literally had to take one step at a time like this and it took forever so this person who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering was suddenly hiding behind people and he 's not the only one in the world sixty thousand people are newly diagnosed with parkinson and this number is only rising as designers we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems one solution that solves it all but it need not always be like that so my aim here was to not but to make their everyday tasks much more simple and then make an impact well i designed the no spill cup it works just purely on its form the curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors but the key here is that it is not tagged as a parkinson 's patient product it looks like a cup that could be used by you me any clumsy person and that makes it much more comforting for them to use to blend in so well one many more to go and then when i was actually observing him walking to his dining table it struck me this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land how does he climb a staircase let me show you how i do it let 's take a look at what and then all this while i 'm thinking oh my god is he really going to do it is he really really going to do it without his walker and then and the turns he took them so so this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs on researching this i realized that it 's because it 's a continuous motion but the moment he 's put on a cycle all his symptoms vanish because it is a so the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land but the one that finally worked was this one let 's take a look and so it happens a lot so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms making them feel much more confident technology is not always it or something like that but i stuck to simple print on the floor this print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome what i wish to do is make every parkinson 's patient feel like my uncle felt that day he told me that i made him feel like his old self again but why can 't smart be something that 's simple and yet effective but let 's not stop at that what would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions let 's make a smarter world but with simplicity"
