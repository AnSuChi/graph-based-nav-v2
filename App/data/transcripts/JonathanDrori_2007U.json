  "transcript": "try and explain why it is that perhaps we don 't understand as much as we think we do this is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year that 's an in joke by the way who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard and they 're questions that i 've asked of science television producers of audiences of science educators so that 's science teachers either on a bit of paper a virtual piece of paper in your head and for viewers at home you can try this as well i think we agree on that where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair right where does all this stuff come from and your next question is can you light a little with a battery a bulb and one piece of wire and would you be able to kind of draw a you don 't have to draw the diagram but would you be able to draw the diagram if you had to do it or would you just say that 's actually not possible i think we can probably agree but why and finally would you be able to and you can sort of scribble it if you like and if you can just scribble a pattern teachers as teachers often think but actually from common sense from experience of the world around them from experience and one of the cardinal right laughter i 'm not quite sure how he died actually was he beheaded in the end or hung but maybe not in this instance a little seed weighs a lot and now i guarantee that about eighty five percent of you or maybe it 's fewer at ted and some people probably two of you will come up and argue with me afterwards and say that actually it comes out of the ground now if that was true we 'd have trucks going round the country filling people 's gardens in with soil it 'd be a fantastic now i passed all my biology exams in i passed them really well but i still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground second one can you light a little torch bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire yes you can and i 'll show you in a second how to do that i have some rather bad news which is that i had a piece of video that i was about to show you which unfortunately the sound doesn 't work in this room i 'm going to describe to you in true monty python fashion what happens in the video and in the video a group of researchers go to mit on graduation day we chose mit because obviously that 's a very long way away from here and you wouldn 't mind too and we intercut it with we are the premier science university in the world because of british like hubris laughter and when we gave graduate engineers that question they said it couldn 't be done and when we gave them a battery and a piece of wire and a bulb and said as if the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people we might as well get it right and there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that 's happening in photosynthesis for one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit and the other half of the carbon equation as i 'm very conscious as a trustee of kew is how much things soak up and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere that 's what plants actually do for a living we are both literally and metaphorically skating on thin ice it 's so easy and that 's one of the problems and it burns you it 's a very powerful bit of learning and it happens pretty early on by extension we think to ourselves why it 's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we 're closer to the sun i promise you that most of you will have got that oh you 're all shaking your heads but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly other ones are kind of going like this all right it 's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the sun are spread out more because of the tilt of the earth and if you think the tilt is tilting us closer no it isn 't the sun is million miles away and we 're tilting like this right it makes no odds in fact in the northern hemisphere we 're further from the sun in summer as it happens but it makes no odds the difference the scribble of the diagram of the solar system if you believe as most of you probably do that it 's hotter in summer than in winter because we 're closer to the sun you must have drawn an ellipse except in your you 're nodding now in your ellipse have you thought well what happens during the night they 've got and then rush back again i mean it 's a and we hold these two models in our head of what 's right and what isn 't right here 's copernicus ' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan that 's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper right and i hope you notice the coincidence here what would you do if you knew that people had this misconception right in their heads of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children what sort of diagram would you show them these are from textbooks from websites educational websites and almost anything you pick up is like that and the reason it 's like that is because it 's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles whereas that 's much more exciting to look at something at that angle isn 't it and by doing it at that angle if you 've got that misconception in your head then that so you 've it 's crap isn 't it really as we say so these mental models we look for evidence that reinforces our models we do this of course with matters of race and politics and everything else and we do it in science as well so we look just look and scientists do it constantly and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models being i 'm in the united states i 'll have a dig at the europeans these are examples of what i would say is bad practice in science teaching centers these pictures are from la villette in france and the welcome and if you look at the kind of the way these things are constructed there 's a lot of mediation by glass and it 's very blue and kind of professional in that way that allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in annie hall and said god that 's so professional and whereas good interpretation i 'll use an example from nearby is san francisco exploratorium where all the things that that the demonstrations and so on are made out of everyday objects that children can understand it 's very hands on and they can engage with and experiment with and i know that if the graduates at mit and in the imperial college in london had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff and you know been able to do it they would have learned how how it actually works rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can 't do it so good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world and things that where there isn 't an extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium and it all looks fantastic ok but amateur in the best sense in other words the root of the word being of love and passion so as monty python would have it this is a bit lord privy seal to say so but children are not empty vessels they come with their own ideas and their own theories and unless you work with those but this applies equally to matters of trying to sell new technology for example we are in britain we 're trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology [ for television ] and it 's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works 's quite difficult to shift those so we 're not empty vessels the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood same for gravity two concepts so it 's which is quite humbling as a you know if you 're a teacher and you look before and after after the teaching and we collude we design tests or at least in britain so that people pass them right and governments do very well they pat themselves on the back ok we collude and actually if you and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air i i might have done better at science so the most important thing is to get people to articulate their"
