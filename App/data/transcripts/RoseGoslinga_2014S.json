  "transcript": "or the goro goro the goro goro and the maize flower is used to make ugali which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm one goro goro can feed three meals for an average family and in one thousand nine hundred and the whole harvest could fit in one goro goro it was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory i insure the rains i come from a family of missionaries who built hospitals in indonesia and my father built a psychiatric hospital in tanzania this is me age five in front of that hospital i don 't think they thought i 'd grow up to sell insurance so let me tell you how that happened and before we knew it we were importing tons of fertilizer and seed and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer and plant a couple of weeks later the international monetary fund visited us and asked my minister but what if it doesn 't rain my minister answered proudly and somewhat defiantly i am going to pray for rain that ended the discussion on the way back to the ministry in the car she turned around to me and said rose you 've always been interested in finance go find us some insurance and last year i was fortunate enough to be part of a team that insured over one hundred and eighty five thousand farmers in kenya and rwanda against they owned an average of half an acre and paid on average two euros in premium because traditional insurance relies on farm visits halfway through and at the end and again if there was a loss to estimate the damages the maths of doing those visits simply don 't add up so instead we rely on technology and data this satellite measures because think about it if there are clouds and then around the march eleven the clouds really move in that and those clouds were the onset of the rains this year this satellite covers the whole of africa and goes back as far as one thousand nine hundred and eighty four because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last thirty years the data alone isn 't enough we devise agronomic algorithms which after that you need rain every three weeks for the crop to form its leaves whereas at flowering you need it to rain more frequently about once every ten days for the crop to form its cob because rains then can damage the crop devising such a cover but it turned out the real challenge was selling insurance we set ourselves a modest target of five hundred farmers insured after our first after a couple of months ' intense marketing we had signed up the grand total of one hundred and eighty five farmers but our prime customers simply weren 't buying they were waiting to see what would happen didn 't trust insurance companies thought i 've managed for so many years why would i buy insurance now turns out selling microcredit isn 't the same as selling insurance for credit a farmer the bank will advance him money that 's an attractive proposition for insurance the farmer needs to trust the insurance company and needs to advance the insurance company money it 's a and so the we tried for some years selling insurance directly to farmers with very high marketing cost and very limited success then we realized that there were many organizations working with farmers the farmer would say but what if it doesn 't rain how do you expect me to repay my loan many of these organizations were taking on the risk themselves simply hoping that that year the worst wouldn 't happen most of the organizations however were limiting their growth in agriculture they couldn 't take on this kind of risk let me tell you one more story at the start of february two thousand and twelve in western kenya the rains started and they started early and when rains start early farmers are encouraged because it usually means that the season is going to be good so they took out loans and planted and the crops that had germinated so well shriveled and died we 'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution that had provided those loans to about six thousand farmers in that area we 've got you we 'll give you two hundred thousand euros at the end of the season could you give us the money now then these farmers can still replant and can get a harvest we took the idea of replanting to a seed company and convinced them to price the cost of insurance into every bag of seed and when the farmers would open the card they 'd text in that number and that number would actually help us to locate the farmer and allocate them to a satellite pixel a satellite would then measure and if it didn 't rain we 'd replace their seed one of the first hold on i 'm not there one of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was bosco mwinyi we visited his farm later that august and i wish i could show you the smile on his face when he showed us his harvest because it warmed my heart and it made me realize why selling insurance can be a good thing but you know he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture so we had to zoom out a lot insurance secured his harvest that we have all the tools to enable african farmers i am looking forward to at least somehow the year of the insurance or the year of the great harvest"
