  "transcript": "even more than that what about predicting human behavior i think those are interesting ideas for me that would be the when actually the things right in front of us are often the hardest to see the things that you look at every day that you 're blinded to great double check make sure you still have them you 've looked at them a few times today but i 'll ask you a question without looking at it directly yet bring them out check and see how accurate you were how 'd now that you 're done down every phone has something in common no matter how you organize the icons you still have a clock on the front so without looking at your phone what time was it you just looked at your clock right interesting idea let 's take that a step further with a game of trust close your eyes i realize i 'm asking you to do that while you just heard there 's a pickpocket what color is my tie now open your eyes show of hands were you right but i have a different theory about that that model it 's kind of and inside your brain is a little security guard for me i like to call him frank so frank is sitting at a desk he 's got lots of cool information in front of him high tech equipment he 's got cameras he 's got a little phone that he can pick up listen to the ears but attention is what steers your perceptions but ironically you can attend to something without being aware of it for example the cocktail effect you 're in a party having conversations with someone and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that now for my job i have to play with techniques to exploit this to play with your attention as a limited resource so if i could instead what i choose to focus on is frank just to go internal for a second so if i ask you to access a memory like what is that and when i do that your frank turns around he accesses the file he has to rewind the tape what 's interesting is he can 't rewind the tape at the same time that he 's trying to process new data this sounds like a good theory but i could talk for a long time tell you lots of things and a portion of them may be true bit of shopping just hold still where you are how are you it good just taking inventory you 're like a buffet hard to tell where to start so many great things hi how are you good to see you hi hopefully so have a seat there you go you 're doing well hi sir how are you come on up this way joe give joe a round of applause come on up joe turn around and let 's see if i give you something that belongs to me this is just something watch it is a task for you to focus on you have your money in your front pocket once a guy had a hole in his pocket and that was rather traumatizing for grab my wrist but squeeze squeeze firm did you see it go joe no ar no it 's not here open your hand while we 're focused on the hand it 's sitting on your shoulder go ahead and take it off now let 's try that again while you were watching i couldn 't get your watch off yet you had something inside your just shopping this trick 's more about the timing i 'm going to try to push it inside your hand put your other hand on top would you it 's amazingly obvious now isn 't it looks a lot like the watch i was wearing your other hand on top if you 're watching this little token this obviously has become a little target like a red herring if we watch this kind of close it looks like it goes away it it falls out of the air lands right back in the hand did you see it go yeah funny we 've if i do it slowly it goes straight that 's rather strange they have shots for that can i show them rather bizarre is this yours sir i have no idea how that works we 'll send that over there i need help with this one step over this way for me don 't run away you had something down by your pants pocket i was checking mine i couldn 't find everything but i noticed you had something here can i feel the outside for a moment down here i noticed this is this something of that 's a shrimp j yeah i 'm saving it for later ar you 've so we 'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift along with a big round of what am i wearing so i guess i 'd like to pose that question to you if you could control somebody 's attention what would you do with it"
