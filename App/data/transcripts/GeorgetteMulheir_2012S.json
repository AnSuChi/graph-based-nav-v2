  "transcript": "approximately one million children live in large residential institutions usually known as orphanages others know more about the living conditions but sixty years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development and this is particularly true for young babies as we know babies are born without their full muscle development the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation every time a young baby learns something new to focus its eyes to mimic a movement or a facial expression to pick something up to form a word or to sit up new synaptic connections are being built in the brain they communicate their delight to their children who respond with smiles desire to achieve more and to learn more it happens so naturally in most families that we don 't even notice it most of us are unaware of its importance to human and it 's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children in august one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of romania after the one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions i was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families housing five hundred and fifty babies this was ceausescu 's show orphanage and so i 'd been told the conditions were but it was as silent as a convent yet the director showed me into room after room each containing row upon row of cots in each of which lay a child staring into space in a room of forty newborns the head nurse told me proudly you see our children are very well behaved within a few days they were listless over the years many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again the walls or the bars of their cots since my first visit to ceausescu 's institution i 've seen hundreds of such places across eighteen countries from the czech republic to sudan lack of stimulation often leads rocking back and forth or aggression whilst in others children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others these children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities most of these children will never leave the institution again for those without disabilities at age three they 're transferred to another institution and at age seven to yet another they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings often without even a chance to say goodbye they learn to survive they learn to defend themselves or they go they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society and a russian study found that two years after leaving institutions young adults twenty percent of them had a criminal record fourteen percent were involved in prostitution and ten percent had taken their own lives but why are there so many orphans in europe when there hasn 't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years in fact more than ninety five percent of these children have living parents and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty disability and ethnicity and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school at age six or seven the institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home if the family 's poor they find it difficult to visit and gradually the relationship breaks down behind each of the million children in institutions there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options and so had to send her older son to the institution or desi in bulgaria who looked after her four children at home until her but then she had to go out to work full time and with no support felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they 're pregnant who leave their babies in a hospital or the new parents the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child 's potential are told by the doctors her leave her in the institution go home and make a healthy one this state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable every child has the right to a family deserves and needs a family and children are amazingly resilient we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on they recover their developmental delays and go on to lead normal happy lives it 's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions whilst good quality foster care costs usually about thirty percent if we spend less on these children but on the right services we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs across europe a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care when i first started to work in romania nearly twenty years ago there were two now there are less than ten thousand and family support services are provided across the country and the resources are being redistributed to the european commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support empowering communities to look after their own children and the better alternatives that exist if we know people who are planning to support orphanages we should convince them to support family services instead thank you"
