  "transcript": "others love playing golf or devouring literature one of my greatest pleasures in life is i have to admit a bit special i cannot tell you how much i enjoy watching cities from the sky from an airplane window some cities are calmly industrious like dusseldorf and then you have paris or i like to find those main streets and highways that structure their space especially at night when commuters make these arteries look dramatically red and golden the city 's vascular system but when i 'm sitting in my car that reality looks very different nothing not public radio no podcast not even mindfulness meditation makes this time worth living isn 't it absurd that we created cars that can reach one hundred and thirty miles per hour and we now drive them at the same speed as 19th century horse carriages twenty nine point six billion hours commuting in two thousand and fourteen twenty six pyramids of giza energy and human potential and it worked it worked admirably for paris when the city tore down hundreds of historical buildings to create too expensive our city 's vascular system is getting clogged it 's getting sick and we should pay attention our current way of thinking is not for our transportation to flow we need a new source of inspiration she was telling me how her treatment was leveraging specific properties of our vascular system wow i thought our vascular system all the veins and arteries in our body making miracles of logistics every day this is the moment i realized that biology has been in the transportation business for billions of years gases and proteins it really is the world 's most sophisticated transportation laboratory so what if the solution to our traffic challenges was inside us i wanted to know why is it that blood flows in our veins most of our lives when our big cities get clogged on a daily basis and the reality is that you 're looking at two very different networks but each of us has sixty thousand miles of blood vessels in our bodies sixty thousand miles that inside you what it means is that blood vessels are everywhere inside us but the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground on the surface so in other words our vascular system uses the three dimensions inside us our urban transportation is mostly two dimensional and so what we need is to embrace that verticality if our surface grid is saturated well let 's elevate our traffic this chinese concept of a bus that can straddle traffic jams on new ways to think about space and movement inside our cities and suspend our transportation like we did with our electrical grid tel aviv and abu dhabi are talking about testing these futuristic networks of suspended magnetic pods the fact that a company like airbus is now seriously working on flying urban taxis flying cars are finally moving from science fiction dj vu and that 's an exciting moment so building this 3 d transportation network is one of the ways we can mitigate and solve traffic jams we have to question other fundamental choices that we made like the vehicles we use the two kids behind you are getting restless always comes when you 're late right that driver is looking for parking there is no parking spot available in the area but how would he know it is estimated that up to thirty percent of urban traffic is generated by drivers looking for parking do you see the one hundred cars around you eighty five of them only have one passenger those eighty five drivers could all fit in one londonian red bus so the question is why are we wasting so much space if it is what we need the most why are we doing this to ourselves biology would never do this space inside our arteries is fully utilized at every heartbeat a higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells into massive trains of oxygen that quickly flow throughout our body and the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized can you imagine if the vehicles we used in our cities were ninety five percent full the reason blood is so incredibly efficient otherwise we would probably have traffic jams in our veins each one of our thirty seven trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen precisely when it needs them blood is both a collective we 've been stuck in an endless debate between creating a car centric society or extensive mass transit systems i think we should transcend this i think we can create vehicles that combine the convenience of cars along with one thousand two the problem with urban trains is that ten fifteen times before your final destination wagons can detach dynamically while you 're moving and become express driverless buses that move on a secondary road network nor a lengthy transfer you are now sitting in a bus that is headed the section you 're sitting in detaches and self drives you right to your doorstep modular driverless vehicles of tomorrow now as if walking in a city buzzing with drones flying taxis modular buses and suspended magnetic pods i think there is another force in action that will make urban traffic mesmerizing if you think about it the current generation of driverless cars is just trying to earn its way into a traffic grid made by and for humans they 're trying to learn traffic rules which is relatively simple but what would happen when whole cities become driverless how about speed limits and when all the cars everything is predictable and reaction time minimum they can drive much faster and can take any rational initiative that can speed them up or the cars around them flow will be regulated by a mesh of dynamic the result a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of german autobahns and the creative vitality of the intersections of mumbai traffic will be functionally exuberant it will be liquid like our blood and by a strange paradox the more robotized our traffic grid will be the more organic and alive its movement will feel so but this process has taken billions of years and went through all sorts of iterations and mutations we can 't wait billions of years to evolve our transportation system the concepts and the the technology to create let 's do it thank you"
