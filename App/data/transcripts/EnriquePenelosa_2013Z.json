  "transcript": "because different from health or education or housing it tends to get worse as societies become richer more than a matter of money or technology is a matter of equality equity that in terms of transport but rather one where even the rich use public transport despite the fact that the netherlands has a higher income per capita than the united states there is a conflict in developing world cities for money for government investment if more money is invested and also there is a conflict for space there is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage most of society 's resources however there is a problem with that that market economy needs inequality of income some others less then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy i would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities the first one is equality of quality of life especially for children that all children should have beyond the obvious health and education access to green spaces to sports facilities and the second kind of equality is one which we could call democratic equality the first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law that is not just if that is true a bus with eighty passengers has a right to eighty times more road space than a car with one we have been so used to inequality sometimes that it 's before our noses and we do not see it less than one hundred years ago and it seemed normal in the same way that it seems normal today applying that democratic principle we implemented a mass transit system and one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol because as buses zoom by expensive cars stuck in traffic it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work it doesn 't take ph d ' s a committee of 12 year old children would find out in twenty minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities this system in guangzhou except for one line we fought not just for space for buses but we fought for space and we humans are pedestrians we need to walk there is a really enormous conflict when we are talking country cities between pedestrians and cars here what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy what this shows is that people who walk third class citizens while those who go in cars are first class citizens what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways and they forgot to make a sidewalk this is prevailing all over the world not even schoolchildren are more important than cars in my city of bogot we fought a very difficult battle in order to take space from cars which had been parking on in order to make space for people that should reflect dignity of human beings and to make space for protected bikeways first of all i had black hair before that however indeed a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city which is road space a city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space how to distribute it between pedestrians and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right more than three hundred i don 't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature they are a right just as sidewalks are unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility without the risk of getting killed also are a powerful symbol of democracy because they show that a citizen on a $ thirty bicycle is equally important and we are living in a unique moment in history in the next fifty years more than half of those cities which will exist in the year two thousand and sixty will be built in many developing country cities more than eighty and ninety percent of the city which will exist in two thousand and and sixty will be built over the next four or five decades but this is not just a matter for developing country cities in the united states for example more than seventy million new homes must be built over the next forty or fifty years that 's more than all the homes that today exist in britain france three year old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world in fact only very recently nine hundred there were no cars cars have been here for really less than one hundred years they completely changed cities in one thousand nine hundred for example nobody was killed by cars in the united states only twenty years later between one thousand nine hundred and twenty and one thousand nine hundred and thirty almost two hundred thousand people were killed by cars in the united states only so we could make cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens such as children or the elderly i will propose to you a couple of ingredients which i think would make cities hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss crossing cities in all directions sort of bicycle highways and i would invite you to imagine the following a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians when we were able to create seventy kilometers enjoy the city and the cars still in the mud of course and of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better which would solve mobility low cost and simple way would be to have hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses buses and low cost solution if implemented from the start because of private property of land and high land prices all developing country cities have a large problem of slums in my country of colombia almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments and of course it 's very difficult but even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places very far from the city centers where it 's impossible to provide passionately to those countries which are yet to urbanize latin america went from forty percent urban in one thousand nine hundred and fifty to eighty percent urban in two thousand and ten i would recommend asian and african countries which are yet to urbanize such as india which is only thirty three percent urban now that governments should acquire all land around cities in this way their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces with the parks with the greenways with the busways the cities we are going to build over the next fifty years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the what a fantastic opportunity for leaders i am sure i am optimistic that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams"
