  "transcript": "i have a friend in portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family but also because he knew how to build a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made so we could build and repair them or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy the open source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they 're made of back into our lives and i believe we need to take them to the next level to the components things are made of paints that conduct electricity pigments that change color fabrics that light up me show you some examples so conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires in the case of this little example i 'm holding we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light conductive ink has and this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light diffusing particles what this means is that while regular acrylic only diffuses light around the edges this one illuminates across the entire surface when i turn on the lights around it so i 'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens so these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials in a few years they will be in many of the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis we may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us well first of all because i am a maker i 'm curious about how things work and how they are made and right now we don 't know enough about these high tech composites our future will be made of so for now they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to so a little over three years ago kirsty boyle and i started a project we called open materials it 's a website where we and anyone else who wants to join us share experiments publish information encourage others to contribute whenever they can and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of first of all because we can 't shape shape what we don 't understand and what we don 't understand and use ends up shaping us secondly and just as important so many times amateurs not experts have been the inventors and improvers of things personal computers airplanes two scientists at university of illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using maker so jordan 's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself another example i 'd like to mention is hannah qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder so hannah 's approach on the other hand is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects so amongst hannah 's many impressive experiments this is one of my favorites [ paper speakers ] what we 're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on so based on the research by marcelo coelho from mit hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink just like jordan and so so hannah 's artisanal work and the fact that she shared her findings opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both and we are not afraid to fail so the more people experiment with materials the more researchers are willing to share their research so i feel a bit as ted nelson must have when in the early so it 's a little strange that i 'm standing here and saying you must understand smart materials now thank you"
