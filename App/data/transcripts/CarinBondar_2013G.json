  "transcript": "anyone in the room thought about sex today yeah you did thank you for putting your hand up over there i 'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex now when humans think about sex male and female forms are generally what come to mind such specific categories didn 't even exist sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of dna shared between two or more beings it wasn 't until about five hundred million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives dna out something that receives it now invariably you 're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species these very familiar structures but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction and males have a swimming penis it leaves the [ body of the male ] attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm for many decades biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether now and it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female 's uterus not to mention it 's a pretty good size the biggest penis in the animal kingdom however is not that of the tapir the biggest and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that and when it comes to sex and these contributions are far from equal eggs are very expensive to make so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with sperm on the other hand is abundant so it makes more sense for males to have a strategy when it comes to gathering and ingesting food this is of course bad news and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization and it 's aptly termed traumatic insemination males have a spiked barbed penis that they literally stab into the female and they don 't stab it anywhere near her vagina they stab now if you 've ever been out for a nice peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex and quite frankly that 's exactly what it is a group of males will grab a female hold her down and corkscrew shaped vagina from flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second now the female actually gets the last laugh though because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries now i like to share stories like this with my audiences because yeah we humans we tend to think sex sex is fun sex is good there 's romance and there 's orgasm but orgasm didn 't actually evolve until about sixty five million years ago with the advent of mammals but pleasing one 's partner earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones it 's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all so going back to our biological minds then we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages why do they do this well according to the biological literature during the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract mm hm these are mexican guppies and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments and these filaments basically form now males have been observed to prod the female 's genital opening prior to copulating and in what i have lovingly termed the magnum p i hypothesis females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches a little guppy porn for you right there so we 've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner we 've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures now unfortunately in the animal kingdom it 's the coercion strategy that we see it 's very common in many now interestingly there are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn 't allow for sexual coercion to take place female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs now even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal and when young males they 're turfed out of the group in hyena societies adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale they can take part in a kill only after everybody else so it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male you take away all the social power he has the sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other so thank you and happy daydreaming"
