  "transcript": "happy to know that i 'll be talking not about my own tragedy but other people 's tragedy it 's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people 's tragedy so if you believe the media accounts being a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic was a very glamorous life in the words of virginia postrel there was money there was drugs guns women you know you name it jewelry bling bling it had it all based on ten years of research a unique opportunity to go inside a gang to see the actual books the financial records of the gang that the answer turns out not to be that being in the gang and that 's what i 'd like to convince you of today so there are three things i want to do first i want to explain how and why crack cocaine had such a secondly i want to tell you how somebody like me came to i want to tell you in a very superficial way about some of the things we found when we actually got to look at the the which is that this given who is up on the stage you 'll be delighted to know that in fact there 'll be no nudity unexpected wardrobe malfunctions in the early ' 80s and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader being a gang leader in the inner city wasn 't such a bad deal in the mid ' 80s the early ' 80s let a lot of power and you got to beat people up you got a lot of prestige a but the thing is there was no money in it you couldn 't charge dues to the people in the gang because the people in the gang didn 't have any money you couldn 't really make any money selling marijuana marijuana 's too cheap it turns out you couldn 't sell cocaine cocaine 's a great product powdered cocaine but you 've got to know rich white people and most of the you had you know and so it wasn 't really a career there were limits to how powerful and important you could be if you had to live at home with your mother then along comes crack cocaine and extra chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city but if you think about it the biggest one in terms of impact on the people who live in the inner city was crack cocaine it was a brilliant way of getting the brain high you could smoke crack cocaine you can 't smoke powdered cocaine and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it and it turned out there was this audience that didn 't know it wanted crack cocaine but when it came it really did and it was a perfect drug you could the cocaine that went into it for a dollar sell it for five dollars highly addictive the high was very short so for fifteen minutes you get this great high and then when you come down all you to do is get high again seemingly to make a lot of money at least for the people on the top so this is where we enter the picture not really me i 'm really a bit player in all this my co author sudhir venkatesh is the main character he was a to the university of chicago he had spent following the grateful dead and in his own words he looked like a freak he 's a dark skinned south asian big man and he had hair in his words down to his ass defied all kinds of boundaries was he black or white was he man or woman he was really a curious sight to be seen and the famous sociologist william julius wilson was doing a book that involved surveying people all across chicago and decided he knew exactly the place to send him which was to one of the toughest so sudhir the suburban boy who had never really been gets to the first building the well there 's nobody there but he hears some voices so he climbs up the stairwell comes around the corner and finds a group of and the mantra was shoot first ask questions later because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard so his greeting was not particularly warm but they did say so i kid you not the first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was the survey was not in the end going to be what got sudhir off the hook he was held hostage overnight there was a lot of gunfire there were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the with the gang members checked out sudhir decided he was no threat and they let him go home and you and i probably faced with the situation would i guess i 'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead i 've been following them for the last three months sudhir on the other hand got right back walked down to the housing project went up to the second floor had so much fun hanging out with you last night i wonder if i could do it again tonight and that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship that involved sudhir living in the housing project on and off for ten years hanging out in crack houses going to jail having the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks you name it waiting for sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang it was one of the the most unequal co authoring relationships ever but i was glad to be the beneficiary of it so what did we find well let me say one thing we really got access to everybody in the gang they trusted sudhir in ways that really no academic has ever or really anybody any outsider has ever earned the trust of these gangs to the point where they actually opened up what was most they made them available to us and we not only could study them but we could ask them questions about what was in them so if i have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time i have if i had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization it would be that the gang is just like mcdonald 's in a lot of different respects the restaurant mcdonald 's so first in one way which isn 't maybe the most interesting way but it 's a good way to start is in the way it 's organized the hierarchy of the gang the way it looks so here 's what the org chart of the stripped down and simplified mcdonald 's org chart this is exactly what they actually call themselves the board of directors and sudhir says it 's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view of of what happened in american corporate life but they had seen movies like wall street and they had learned a little bit about now below that board of directors you 've got essentially what are regional vps people who control which it turned out for this black gang was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook but the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald 's is its franchisees they get the exclusive property rights to control the drug selling they get the name of the gang behind them for merchandising and marketing and they 're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit depending on how good they are at running the business i really want you to think about though are the ones at the bottom the foot soldiers these are the the teenagers typically who 'd be standing out on the street corner selling the drugs extremely dangerous work and important to note is that almost all of the weight all of the people in this organization are at the bottom just like mcdonald in fact in these neighborhoods they 'd be the same people so the same kids who are working in the gang were actually at the very same time which already because the hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $ three it was below the minimum wage there was very little money and that in some ways was the best job you could hope to get if you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods one of the sad parts of this is that indeed among the many other ramifications of crack cocaine is that the most talented individuals in these communities because there were no legitimate channels out this was the best way out and it actually was the right choice to try to make it out this way you look at this the relationship to mcdonald 's breaks down here the money looks about the same well the reason it 's such a bad job is that there 's somebody shooting at you a lot of the time so with shooting at you what are the death rates we found in our gang and admittedly this was not really a standard situation but there were costs and so the death rate not to mention the rate of being arrested sent to prison being wounded the death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year you you expect to die with about a that is about as high as you can get so for comparison 's purposes let 's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky let 's say that you were a murderer and you were convicted of murder and you 're sent to death row it two percent a year so it 's a lot safer being on death row than it is selling drugs out on the street you some pause for those of you who believe that a death penalty 's going to have an enormous deterrent effect effect on crime to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack and i 'm not really focusing on the negatives but really there 's another story to tell you there if you look at the death rates just of random young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states the death rates during crack were about one in some sense to put it into perspective if you compare this to the soldiers in iraq for instance right now fighting the war zero point five percent so in some very literal way the young black men who were growing up in this country were living in a war very much in the sense that so why in the world you might ask would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner why would they do that i think the first one is that they got fooled by history you dropped out of the gang so what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time the people who happened to be leading the gang in the out of the gang like everybody else has and the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth there are striking similarities i think to the internet boom the first set of people in silicon valley got very very rich and then all of my friends said maybe i should go do that too and they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came in some sense that 's what happened exactly to the we were looking at they were willing to start at the bottom just like say and they never got to make so everybody got stuck at that and so and they 'd drive fancy cars because they couldn 't afford to own fancy cars and they didn 't really have gold jewelry they had gold plated jewelry it goes back to you know the real real versus they would give a so which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics from the study of the gang often our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data but what 's kind of interesting is that in this setting it 's unfettered capitalism called a compensating differential because they 're not willing to to be and the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely he says would you stand around here when all this shit the shooting if all this shit 's going on no right so if i gonna be asked to put my life on the line then front me the cash man i think the gang member says it much more articulately than here 's the translation you get from the gang member they 're talking about the decision of why they don 't go shoot one thing that turns out to be a great if you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang 's territory people are afraid to go buy drugs there they 're going to come into your neighborhood here 's what he says about why they don 't do that if we start shooting around there the other gang 's territory but we gotta be careful ' cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked so that 's the same concept then again sometimes economists get it wrong one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like no matter how bad it was economically he always got himself paid we had some related to cash flow and lack of access to capital markets and things like that then we asked the gang member why is it you always get paid and your workers don 't always get paid his response is you got all these niggers below you who want your job you dig if you start taking losses they see you as weak and shit and i thought about it and said ceos often pay and it never would really occur to an economist that this this idea of ' weak and shit ' could really be important"
