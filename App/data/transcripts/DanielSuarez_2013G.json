  "transcript": "i 'm here to talk about very real killer robots autonomous combat drones which have a human making targeting decisions i 'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons now lethally autonomous killer robots would take many forms these are two automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the dmz between north and south korea both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target and firing on it the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer in both cases there 's still a human in the loop but it 's not a technological requirement it 's a choice and it 's that choice that i want to focus on because as we migrate lethal decision making from humans far from the battlefield that 's because the way humans resolve conflict and this has always been the case throughout history for example these were state of the art weapons systems in one thousand four hundred a d now they were both very expensive to build and maintain but with these you could dominate the and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that power was focused at the very top and what changed and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield and as armies grew in size arose as a political and logistical requirement of defense so again the tools we use to resolve conflict shape our social landscape autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool except that by they risk possibly reversing a five century trend toward democracy now i think knowing this we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions to do what humans do best which is adapt seventy nations are developing and as you 'll see remotely piloted combat drones are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons that 's because once you 've deployed remotely piloted drones there are three powerful factors pushing decision making away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself the first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce example in two thousand and four the u s drone fleet produced a grand total of seventy one hours of video surveillance for analysis by two thousand and eleven this had gone up to three hundred thousand hours outstripping human ability to review it all but even that number is about to go up drastically the pentagon 's gorgon stare and argus programs will put up to camera eyes but there 's a second but any and that means drones and they 'll react to new circumstances without human guidance which brings us to really the third and most powerful incentive now we live in a global economy and in that environment it is very likely that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories proliferate in the gray market situation sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon this raises the very real possibility and that could shift the balance in the private enterprise even powerful individuals it could create a landscape of rival warlords undermining rule of law and civil society now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both now you might be thinking that citizens of high tech nations i think citizens of and the reason can be summed up in one word data transportation it 's a wealth of real time data what you 're looking at here lines indicate social connectedness between and these types of maps can be automatically generated based on the data trail modern people leave behind because targeting is used in another context notice that certain individuals are highlighted these are the hubs of social networks and these people also can be automatically identified from their communication patterns but if you 're a repressive government searching for political enemies you might instead remove them eliminate them disrupt their social and those who remain behind lose social cohesion and organization borders would offer very little protection to critics of distant governments or trans national criminal organizations popular movements agitating for change could be detected early and their leaders eliminated before their ideas achieve critical mass and ideas achieving critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action and this would put a chill on free speech and this is why we need an international treaty on robotic weapons and in particular a global ban now we already have international treaties on nuclear and biological weapons but robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous because they will almost certainly be used and they would also be corrosive to our democratic now in november two thousand and twelve the u s department of defense this temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the u s military but that directive needs to be made and it could set the stage for global action and we need it now before there 's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences and they would imperil environmental monitoring search and rescue logistics how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons no robot should have an expectation of privacy in a public place each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed and every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them both right now and historically and civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down but notice this is more an immune system than a weapons system it would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our civil society we must ban the deployment and development autocratic governments and criminal organizations undoubtedly will but let 's not join them and that would be corrosive to representative government let 's make sure for democracies thank you"
