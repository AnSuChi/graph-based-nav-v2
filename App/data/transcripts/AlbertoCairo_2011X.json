  "transcript": "i work for the red cross and i 'm a physical therapist my job is to make we do more than that we provide the patients the afghan disabled first with the physical rehabilitation but it was not always like this for many years we were just providing them with it took quite today i would like to and the story of the people who made this change possible i arrived in afghanistan in one thousand nine hundred and ninety to work in a hospital for i was also working in the orthopedic center we call it this is the place where we make the legs at that time i found myself there was so much to learn there were so many things new to me but it was a terrific job but as soon as the fighting intensified the physical rehabilitation was suspended there were many other things to do so the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority every time i i make this speech it 's not the first time but it 's an emotion it 's something that comes comes out from the past i was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque i wanted to go home i was driving forget you don 't want to see things so you just want to to go to your room to lock yourself inside and say that 's enough a bomb fell not far from my car well far enough but big noise and everybody disappeared from the street the cars disappeared as well i ducked and only one figure remained in the middle of the road it was a man in a wheelchair desperately trying to to move away well i 'm not a particularly brave person i have to confess it but so i stopped the car the man was without legs behind him there was a child his son red in the face in an effort to so i took him into a safe place and i ask what are you doing out in the and then i ask an why don 't you have the artificial legs and he said the red cross has closed we will provide you with a maybe the machinery is broken who is going to make the legs for him so i hoped that he would not come this is the streets of kabul so i and i spoke with a i was ready to tell him listen if someone such and such comes tell him that it was a mistake nothing can be done and they were not alone maybe twenty people like him waiting and there was some staff too among them there was my right hand man najmuddin it 's not a priority but najmuddin told me listen now we 're here at least we can start repairing the prostheses the broken prostheses of the people and maybe try to do something for people like mahmoud i when you have twenty people so we started doing some repairs also one of the physical therapists reported that mahmoud could be provided with a leg but not immediately the legs were swollen and the knees were stiff so he needed a long preparation believe me i was worried because i was breaking the rules i was doing something that i was not supposed to do in the evening i went to to speak with the bosses at the headquarters and i told them i lied just a few repairs maybe some of them on the patients he was telling me patients are coming we knew that and slowly slowly week after week he was coming every day crossing the front line i tell you it was something so sinister that i was astonished he could do it every day we could not possibly stay indoors with all these sandbags at the windows very so we and and they started two groups of mujahideen started fighting we could hear in the air the the shelter mahmoud grabbed his son i grabbed someone else everybody was grabbing something and but inside all of us panting i sat a no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair dignity cannot wait for better times from that day on we never closed a single day we never i met mahmoud one year later later he was in good shape a bit thinner he needed to change his prostheses a new pair of prostheses i asked about his son he told me he 's at school he 'd doing quite well but i understood he wanted to tell me he said thank you very much now help me not to be a beggar anymore that was the job i don 't want them to be teased at school by the other students how much money do i have in my pocket just to give him some money it was the easiest way i ask for a job and then he added something i will never forget for the rest of my life he said but if you help me i 'm ready to do anything even if i have to crawl on the ground legless with only one arm we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the we can modify the the workbench maybe to put a special stool a special anvil special vice and maybe an electric screwdriver i said listen it 's cruel to offer him a job knowing that he 's going to fail we cannot discuss so the only things i could manage to to obtain was a kind of compromise only one week one week try and not a single day more one week later mahmoud was the fastest in the production line and then i asked for verification i understood that mahmoud had looked taller i remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling he was a new i understood that what made him stand tall so of course i understood and then we started a new policy a new policy completely different it became and you know what it 's good for everybody everybody benefits from that because they get a job and dignity they are seven thousand every year people coming for the first time and you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them sometimes you see them they look poof they learn much faster the motivation the empathy they can establish with the patient is completely different completely scraps of men do not exist people like you cannot stop so and when you start you cannot stop so you do vocational training physical therapies can be done not only in the orthopedic center but also in the houses of the people terrible najmuddin is that one that this way of working this way of thinking is going to be implemented in other countries are plenty of countries at war like afghanistan all we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist to make them part of the the decision making process and then of course to adapt recently we have just started a program a sport program we transport the wheelchairs everywhere we have several teams in the main part of afghanistan at the beginning when anajulina is it really necessary and you should see me during the match i shout a true italian what 's next what is going to be the next change well i don 't know yet but i 'm sure najmuddin and his friends they have it already in mind thank you very much"
