  "transcript": "and as a sister and later as a scientist i wanted to understand why is it that i can take my dreams i can connect them to my reality and i can make my dreams come true and i moved from my home state of indiana to boston where i was working in the lab of dr francine benes and in the lab we were asking the question what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia but then in the evenings and and on the weekends i traveled as an advocate for nami the national alliance on mental illness but on the morning of december ten one thousand nine hundred and ninety six i woke up to discover that i had a brain disorder of my own a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain and in the course of four hours i watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information on the morning of the hemorrhage i could not walk and i have brought for you a real human brain this is a real human brain this is the front of the brain the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down it 's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another for those of you who understand computers while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which is made up of some three hundred million axonal fibers but other than that the two hemispheres are completely it 's been a joy right now our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like i am an connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we are connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human and in this moment we are perfect we are whole and we are beautiful my left hemisphere our left hemisphere is a very different our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically our left hemisphere is all about the past and it 's all about the future it then categorizes and organizes all that associates it with everything in the past we 've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities you 've got to remember to pick up on your way home i need them in the morning it 's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when i have to do my laundry it 's that little voice that says to me i am and as soon as my left hemisphere says to me i am i become separate i become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you and it just gripped me and then it released me and then it just gripped me and then it released me and it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of of pain so i thought ok i 'll just start my normal routine so i got up and i jumped onto my cardio glider which is a and i 'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws and it was all very peculiar and i 'm walking across my living room floor and i realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down and every step is very rigid and very deliberate there 's no fluidity to my pace and there 's this constriction in my area of perception so i 'm just focused on internal systems and i 'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and i could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body i heard a little i can 't define where i begin and where i end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of and all i could detect was this energy and i 'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent total silence and at first i was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then i was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because i could no longer identify the boundaries i felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there i 've got a problem but then i immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and i affectionately refer to this space as la la land but it was beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world so here i am in this space and my job and any stress related to my my job it was gone and i felt lighter in my body and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone and imagine what it would feel like to lose baggage oh i felt euphoria euphoria it and i 'm thinking i 've got to get to work i drive and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side then i realized oh my gosh i 'm having a stroke the next thing my brain says to me is wow this is so cool this is so cool how many brain so i 've got to call help i 've got to call work i couldn 't remember the number at work so i remembered in my office i had a business card with my number so i go into my business room and i 'm looking at the card on top and even though i could see clearly in my mind 's eye what my business card looked like i couldn 't tell if this was my card or not because all i could see were pixels and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and i just and in that moment i would be able to reattach to normal reality and i could tell that 's not the card that 's not the card it took me i do not understand numbers and i 'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad but then i would drift back out into la la land and not remember when i came back if i so i had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as i went along and pushed them so that as i would come back to normal reality i 'd be able to tell yes i 've already dialed that number eventually the whole number gets dialed and i 'm listening to the phone and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me and so i say to him clear in my mind i say to him this is jill i need help and what comes out of my voice is woo woo woo woo woo i 'm thinking oh my gosh i sound like a golden retriever so i couldn 't know i didn 't know that i couldn 't speak or understand language until i tried so he recognizes that i need help and he gets me help and a little while later i am ambulance from one hospital across boston to [ massachusetts ] general hospital and i curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last last bit of air just right out of the balloon i just felt my energy lift and just i and and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition when i woke later that afternoon i was shocked to discover that i was still alive and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality out from the background noise and i just wanted to escape because i could not identify the position of my body in space i felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through the sea i found nirvana i 'm still then everyone who is alive can find nirvana and i pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and then i realized what a tremendous gift and it motivated me to recover two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers here i am with my mama who is a true angel in my life it took me eight years to completely recover of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world right here right now i can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere life force power of the fifty trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form at one with all that is or where i become a single individual a solid separate from the flow separate and when i believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep and i thought that was an idea worth spreading"
