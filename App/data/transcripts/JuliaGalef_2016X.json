  "transcript": "i 'd like you to imagine for a moment that you 're a soldier in the heat of battle regardless of your time and place there are some things that are constant your adrenaline is elevated so now i 'd like you to imagine playing a very different role that of the scout the scout 's job is not to attack or defend the scout 's job is to understand the scout identifying potential obstacles but above all the scout wants to know what 's really there as accurately as possible but you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives making good decisions is mostly about which mindset you 're in to illustrate these mindsets in action i 'm going to take you back to where this innocuous looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history it was discovered in by officers in the french general staff they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to germany so they launched a big investigation suspicions quickly converged on this man alfred dreyfus and unfortunately at this time the french army was highly they compared dreyfus 's handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity but never mind that because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it they went and looked through his personal history for they talked to his teachers they found that he had studied foreign languages in school which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments later in life his teachers also said that dreyfus known for having a good memory which was highly suspicious right and dreyfus was found guilty afterwards they took him out into this public square so there he writing letters and letters to the french government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence but for the most part france considered the matter closed one thing that 's really interesting to me about the dreyfus affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that dreyfus was guilty i mean you might even assume that that they were setting him up that they were intentionally framing him but historians don 't think that 's what happened as far as we can tell the officers genuinely believed that the case against dreyfus was strong which what does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man shape the way we interpret information some information some ideas feel like our allies we want them to win we want to defend them so this is why i call motivated reasoning you have never persecuted a french jewish officer for high treason i assume but maybe you 've followed sports or politics so you might have noticed that but if he judges that the other team committed a foul awesome that 's a good call let 's not examine it too closely or maybe you 've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy like capital punishment and as researchers have demonstrated if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it 's not effective but if it shows that capital punishment works it 's a good study and vice versa if you don 't support capital punishment same thing by which side we want to win and this is ubiquitous this shapes what we consider fair or ethical what 's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset is how unconscious it is we can think we 're being objective and however fortunately for dreyfus his story is not over and like most people he assumed dreyfus was guilty also like most people in the army he was at least casually anti semitic but even after dreyfus was in prison and he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo much closer than dreyfus 's handwriting so he brought these discoveries to his superiors they either didn 't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings like but dreyfus is still guilty eventually picquart managed to get dreyfus and for part of that time he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army a lot of people feel like picquart can 't really be the hero of this story but personally for me the fact that picquart was anti semitic actually makes his actions because he had the same prejudices the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that picquart is a poster child for what i call scout mindset but just to see what 's really there as as honestly and accurately as you can even if it 's not pretty or convenient or pleasant this mindset is what i 'm personally passionate about and i 've spent the last few years sometimes at least able to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can emotional so just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like defensiveness or tribalism scout mindset is too it 's just rooted in different emotions they 're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new itch to solve a puzzle they 're more likely to say and they 're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak and above all scouts are grounded which means as a person isn 't tied so they can believe that capital punishment works if studies come out showing that it doesn 't they can say huh looks like i might be wrong doesn 't mean i 'm bad or stupid this cluster of traits is what researchers have found and i 've also found anecdotally and the key takeaway i want to leave you with about those traits is that they 're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know in fact they don 't correlate very much with iq at all they 're about how you feel by saint exupry he 's the author of the little prince he said if you want to build don 't drum up your men to collect wood and and give orders and distribute the work instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea i claim if we really want to improve our judgment as as individuals and as societies what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric probability or economics even though those things are quite valuable we need to change the way we feel we need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something we need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts the question i want to leave you with is what do you most yearn for do you yearn to defend your own beliefs or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can thank you"
