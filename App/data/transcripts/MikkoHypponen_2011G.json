  "transcript": "think about all the services we use all the connectivity all the and it 's happening during our lifetimes i 'm pretty sure that one day we 'll be this time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online the generation that built something really and truly global it 's also true that the internet has problems very serious problems problems with security i 've spent my career so let me show you something this here is we know let 's take a look all right and if we take a closer look inside we 'll see that right there it says welcome to the dungeon and basit and amjad are first i decided to go to pakistan this is from the city of lahore which is around three hundred kilometers south from abbottabad where bin laden was caught here 's a typical street they are still there so here standing up is basit sitting down is his brother amjad these are the guys who wrote the first pc virus now i asked them how they and i got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both basit and amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years so there is there is some sort of justice in the world after all now the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and so let me just let 's go with the centipede virus first and you can see at the top of the screen there 's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one you know that you 're infected because it actually shows up here 's another one this is the virus called crash invented in russia in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two let me show you one which actually makes some sound guess what the walker virus yes there 's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected so it used to be fairly easy to know that you 're infected by a virus viruses are a global problem what we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs where we track virus infections worldwide so we can actually see in real time that we 've just blocked viruses in sweden and taiwan and russia and elsewhere in fact if i just connect back to our lab systems through the web we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses how many new examples of malware we find every single day here 's the latest virus we 've found in a file called and we found it and that 's the last twenty minutes of malware every single day so where are all these coming from then it 's gangs like let 's go to so if you are a virus writer and you 're capable of infecting windows computers but you don 't know what to do with them which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking or keyloggers keyloggers so you 're sitting on your computer and you 're doing google searches every single google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals same thing with every single password and so on but the thing that they 're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store because when you do purchases in online stores you will be typing in your name the delivery address your credit card number and the credit card security codes and here 's an example of a file that 's the credit card number that 's the expiration date that 's the security code and that 's the name of the we now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime one example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing go and have a look at the pages of interpol and search for wanted persons we find guys like bjorn sundin originally from sweden and his partner in crime also listed on the interpol wanted pages mr shaileshkumar jain a u s citizen and that bank account had fourteen point nine million u s dollars on it so the amount of money online crime generates is significant and that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks we know that online criminals are hiring programmers hiring testing people testing their code having and they can afford to watch how we work like how security people work and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage i mean the internet and if you just go and take a look at what 's happening the online world moves using the fact that we don 't have the capability to globally police operations like this so how do you actually go around finding online criminals how do you actually track them down what we have here is one exploit file which contains an exploit and that basically means if you 're trying to view this image file on your windows computer it actually takes over your computer and runs code now if you 'll take a look at this image file well there 's the image header and there the actual code of the attack and that code has been encrypted so let 's decrypt it it has been encrypted with xor function ninety seven you just have to believe me it is it is and we can go here and actually start decrypting it well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted and i know it doesn 't really look much different from the original but just keep staring at it you 'll actually see that down here you can see a web but even more interestingly if we continue decrypting we 'll find this mysterious string which says so i spoke with the guys at the lab and we have a couple of russian guys in our labs and one of them mentioned well it ends in rus like russia and for example you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that so i and through a long road we eventually found this one particular website here 's this russian guy who 's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website and he runs a blog under the popular live journal and on this blog he blogs about his life about his life in now that 's a nice car for a 20 something year old kid in st petersburg how do i know about this car because he blogged about the car and he put blogged images about the car accident that 's his mercedes right here is the lada samara he crashed into and you can actually see that the license plate of the samara ends in and if you actually take a look at the scene picture you can see that but if i would be this is where i would say i rest my case well in most cases it never gets this far the vast majority of the online crime cases we don 't even know unfortunately it isn 't but things are also changing if you look at what stuxnet did is that it infected these that 's a siemens plc programmable logic [ controller ] and this plc 's these small boxes which have no display no keyboard which are programmed are put in place and they do their job for example the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these stuxnet infects one of these that 's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about because everything around us is being run by these i any chemical plant any food processing plant you look around everything on these computers working we have become very reliant on obviously we must have some way of continuing to work even if computers so preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted thinking about the things that actually matter now i told you i love the internet i do think about all the services we have online think about if they are taken away from you if one day you don 't actually have them for some reason or another but i 'm worried that we might not see that i 'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us laughter i 've spent my life and i do feel that if we don 't fight online crime we are and we have to do it right now what we need is more global international law enforcement work that 's much more important than running and even more importantly we have to find the people who but without the opportunities give them the opportunities to use their skills for good"
