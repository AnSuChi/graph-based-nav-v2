  "transcript": "ironically i 'm an australian who prefers proper icy cold weather so i was both excited and tearful i was welcomed into the home of a beautiful icelandic family and helped me get a grasp of the melodic icelandic language and i slept a lot two hours of chemistry class in a language that you don 't yet understand can be a pretty good sedative laughter my teacher recommended i try out for the school play just to get me a bit more socially active it but through it i met thordis we shared a lovely teenage romance and we 'd meet at lunchtimes to just hold hands and walk around old downtown reykjavk i met her welcoming family and she met my friends we 'd been in a budding relationship for a bit over a month when our school 's christmas ball was held thordis elva no longer a child but a young woman i felt it was only natural to try drinking rum for the first time that night too that was a bad idea i became very ill drifting in and out of consciousness in between spasms of convulsive vomiting but tom acted as my knight in but the gratitude that i felt towards him soon turned to horror as he proceeded to take off my clothes i thought i 'd be severed in two and ever since that night i 've known that there are seven thousand two hundred seconds in two hours despite limping for days and crying for weeks this incident didn 't fit my ideas about rape like i 'd seen on tv by the time i could identify what had happened to me as rape he had completed his exchange program and left for australia so i told myself it was pointless to address what had happened i was raised in a world where girls are taught that they get raped for a reason and it wasn 't the only thing that could 've stopped me from being raped that night is the man who raped me the after effects of drinking a certain hollowness that i tried but i didn 't show up at thordis 's door it is important to now state that i didn 't see my deed for what it was the word rape didn 't echo around my mind as it should 've and i wasn 't crucifying myself with memories of the night before it wasn 't so much a conscious refusal it was more like any acknowledgment of reality was forbidden thordis i repudiated the entire act in the days afterwards and when i was committing it and this is a lie spine bending guilt for feeling a sharp stab of heavyheartedness each time and then i tied a rock to them what followed is a nine year period that can best be titled as denial and running i didn 't stand still long enough to do so whether it substance use thrill seeking or i refused to be static and silent i gripped tight to the simple notion that i wasn 't a bad person i didn 't think i had this in my bones i thought i was made up of something else in my nurtured upbringing my loving extended family and role models people close to me were warm and genuine in their respect shown towards women it took me a long time to stare down this dark corner of myself and to ask it questions nine years after the christmas dance i was twenty five years old and headed straight for a nervous breakdown my self worth was buried under a soul crushing load of silence that isolated me from everyone that i cared about and i was consumed with misplaced hatred and anger that i took out on myself i stormed out of the door in tears after a fight with a loved one but the truth i found myself counting seconds again but that day i watched in wonder as the words streamed out of my pen forming the most pivotal letter i 've ever written addressed to tom but deep down i realized that this was my way out of my suffering because regardless of whether or not he deserved my forgiveness i deserved peace my era of shame was over the only outcome that i didn 't prepare myself for was the one that i then got a typed confession from tom and this marked the start of an i relieved myself of the burdens that i 'd wrongfully shouldered and he in turn wholeheartedly owned up to what he 'd done but we 'd begun a dialogue that i felt was necessary to explore to its fullest i mustered the courage to propose a wild idea that we 'd meet up in person and face our past once and for all ts iceland and australia are geographically like this and there we met for one week nowhere else has healing and rapprochement been tested like it has in south africa as a nation south africa sought to sit within knowing this only magnified the effect that cape town had on us we followed a strict policy of being honest and moments where we just the seismic effects of sexual violence were spoken aloud and felt face to face and even some totally unexpected but liberating laughter when it came down to it we did out best and our individual realities were aired with an an unfiltered purity that couldn 't do any less than lighten the soul wanting to take revenge is a very human emotion but had i not found a way out of the hatred and anger i 'm not sure i 'd be standing here today to say that i didn 't have my doubts along the way i remember thinking why did i not just get myself a therapist and a bottle of vodka like a normal person would do at times our search for understanding in cape town felt like an impossible quest and all i wanted to do was to give up and go home to my loving husband vidir and our son but despite our difficulties this journey did result in a victorious feeling and back when i was a teenager i would have needed to know that the shame wasn 't mine that there 's hope after rape which is why i started writing feverishly upon my return from cape town resulting in a book co authored by tom that we hope can be of use to people from both ends of the scale if nothing else given the nature of our story i know the words that inevitably accompany it rapist and labels are a way to organize concepts but they can also be dehumanizing in their and likewise once someone has been branded a rapist it 's that much easier to call him a monster but how will we understand what it is in human societies that produces violence if we refuse to recognize the humanity of those who commit it and how and how can we empower survivors if we 're making them feel less than how can we discuss solutions to one of the biggest threats to the lives of women and children around the world if the very words we use are part of the what i 've now learnt my actions that night in were a self centered taking i felt deserving of thordis 's body i chose to draw upon the negative ones nobody else i do think a surprising thing can happen it 's what i call a paradox of ownership put simply something you 've done doesn 't have to constitute the sum of who you are and it was replaced with the clean air of acceptance an acceptance that i did hurt this wonderful person standing next to me an acceptance that i am part of a large and shockingly everyday grouping of men who have been sexually violent toward their partners saying to thordis that i raped her far too often the responsibility the denial and running leaves all parties at a great distance from the truth there 's definitely a public conversation happening now i feel a real responsibility to add our voices to it te nobody has the right to tell anyone else how to handle their deepest pain breaking your silence is never but with that privilege of having a voice comes the responsibility of using it that 's the least i owe my fellow survivors who can 't but it doesn 't have to be that way one of the things that i found useful on my own healing journey is educating myself about sexual violence and as a result i 've been reading going to conferences around the world but it 's about time that we stop treating sexual violence as a women 's issue a majority of sexual violence and yet their voices are sorely underrepresented in this discussion but all of us are needed here just imagine all the suffering we could alleviate if we dared to face this issue together"
