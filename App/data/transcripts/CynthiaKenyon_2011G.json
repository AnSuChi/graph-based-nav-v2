  "transcript": "this is a dream of the ages but scientists they thought you just wear out there 's nothing you can do about it kind of like an old shoe then you can imagine that if you could change one of the genes in an experiment an aging gene and if you could do that then you could find the genes for aging and if they exist and you can find them then maybe one could eventually do something about it so we 've set out to look for genes that control aging and we didn 't study any of these animals instead we studied a little tiny round worm called c after a month most of the mutant worms and next you 're going to see the when it 's young so this animal is going to live twice as long is it miserable it doesn 't seem to be it 's active you can 't tell the difference really and they can be completely fertile have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do you can see the little head moving down at the bottom there and if you look at the tissues of the animal they 're starting to deteriorate you know even if you 've never seen one of these little c elegans which probably most of you haven 't seen one you can tell they 're old isn 't that interesting so there 's something about and now here is the one gene is changed out of twenty thousand and look at it it 's the same age but it 's not in the nursing and when i tell people about this they tend to think of maybe an eighty or ninety year old person who looks really good for being ninety or eighty but it 's really more like this and you say well how old are you she says i 'm sixty that 's what it 's like and you would never know you would never know until she told you so what is the daf 2 gene well as you know genes which are part of the dna they 're instructions to make a protein that does something and the daf 2 gene encodes a hormone receptor so what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell so part of it is like a baseball glove part of it 's on the outside and it 's catching the hormone as it so that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging so it 's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself speeding up aging so this is altogether really really interesting it says that so what kind of hormones are there 's lots of hormones there 's testosterone adrenalin you know about a lot of them these hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about maybe they also affect aging and it 's looking like that 's the case so after we made our discoveries with little c elegans people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking if we made the same daf 2 mutation the hormone receptor mutation in other animals will they live longer and that is the so it 's an ancient pathway because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals and also the common precursor also gave rise to people so maybe it 's working in people the same way and there are hints of this so for example there was one study that was done in a population of ashkenazi jews in new york city and just like any population most of the people but some live to be ninety or one hundred and what they found was that people who lived to ninety or one hundred were more likely to have daf 2 mutations that is changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for igf 1 made the gene it damaged the gene so those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones heart disease all sorts of diseases it turns out that these long lived mutants are more resistant to and it makes sense in a way that they 're still young so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old so it suggests that if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age related diseases all at once how could that work well it turns out that in the daf 2 mutants and the way that they 're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called foxo so in a daf 2 mutant you see that i have the x drawn here the receptor the receptor isn 't working as well under those conditions the foxo protein in blue has gone into the nucleus that little compartment there in the middle of the cell and it 's sitting down on a gene binding to it you see one gene there are lots of genes actually that bind on foxo and it 's just sitting on one of them so foxo turns on a lot of genes and the genes it turns on includes antioxidant whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well to fold correctly and function correctly and it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they 're damaged and many of these different genes we 've shown actually contribute to the long lifespan of the so it 's really interesting these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do then it triggers a series of events that prevent foxo from getting into the nucleus where the so it can 't turn the genes on well we think that insulin and igf 1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions in the good times when food is plentiful and there 's not a lot of stress in the environment the levels of these hormones drop for example having limited food supply so it activates foxo foxo goes to the dna and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself and that 's why we think the animals live longer so you can think of foxo as being like but it 's deteriorating and then suddenly he learns that there 's going to be a hurricane so he doesn 't actually do anything himself he gets on the on the telephone just like foxo gets on the dna the window person the painter so that that 's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists now the really cool thing about foxo is that there are different forms of it we all have foxo genes but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes and there are certain forms of the foxo gene and that 's the case all over the world as you can see from these stars and each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked okay are there differences in the type of and that means that maybe if we tweak it a little bit we can increase so this is really exciting to me a foxo is a protein that we found in these little round worms to affect lifespan and here it so we 've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this foxo cell using human cells now and i 'm really optimistic that this is going to work there are lots of different proteins that are known to affect and mutations that damage the tor gene just like the daf 2 mutations extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse even when it 's pretty old like age sixty for a human that old for a mouse if you give the mouse now i don 't want you all to go out taking rapamycin it is a drug for people but the reason is so this may not be the perfect drug there 's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan which comes out of this science that 's been done in all these different animals thank you although you 're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me what you could do now pretty well in the lab if you were allowed ethically is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer they would just bind to the protein itself so if you stop taking the drug the protein would go back to normal you could change the genes in principle there isn 't the technology to do that but i don 't think that 's a good idea and the reason is they 're essential if you knock them out completely so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any any problems and i think that 's much better that kind of control would be much better as a drug and also there are other ways of activating foxo that don 't even involve insulin or igf 1 that might even be safer a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about which is a negligible senescence there are some creatures on this planet already that don 't really just move to one side for us if you would ck there are there are some animals that don 't seem to age for tortoises called blanding 's turtles you can 't tell the difference just by looking between those turtles and twenty year old turtles and they also have more progeny every year and there are other examples of these kinds of animals like turns certain kinds of birds are like this and nobody knows if you look at birds which live a long time cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or so it could be that the pathways that i 've been talking about which are set to run really quickly in the worm have a different normal set point in in something like a bird so that a bird can live a lot longer and maybe they 're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all but we don 't know mr but what you 're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing you notice that you 're getting old and you look at your human and you think but now we 're the human looking out and imagining a different human thank you very much indeed"
