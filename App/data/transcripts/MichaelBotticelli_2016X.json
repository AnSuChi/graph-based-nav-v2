  "transcript": "and you probably wouldn 't be able to tell that if you met me i had a good job but my insides were rotting away and even though i couldn 't name it then growing up as a gay kid but drinking took all of that away and when i finally did come out in the early 1980s about the only places to meet other gay people to socialize to be yourself were gay bars and i did a lot my story is not unique like millions of americans my disease progressed undiagnosed it took me to people and places and things that i never would have chosen it wasn 't until an intersection with the law gave me an opportunity to get care that i began my journey of recovery but it hasn 't been without and i 've also lost countless friends to hiv and aids our current opioid epidemic and the aids epidemic tragically have much in common right now we are in the midst of one of the greatest health crises of our time during two thousand and fourteen alone twenty eight thousand people died of drug overdoses associated with prescription drugs and heroin during the 1980s scores of people were dying from hiv and aids some wouldn 't even utter the words they didn 't want they called for quarantines they wanted to separate the innocent victims from the rest of us i was afraid we were losing this battle because people were blaming us for being sick public policy was being research recovery but we changed all that because out of the pain of those deaths we saw a social and political movement aids galvanized us into action to stand up to speak up and to act out and it also galvanized the lgbt movement we have the potential to see the end of hiv aids in our lifetime yet simple decision for people to come out to their neighbors to their friends to their families and to their coworkers years ago i was a volunteer for the names project this was an effort started by cleve jones in san francisco to show that people who died of aids had names i still recall unfolding the aids memorial quilt on the national mall so fast forward to two thousand and fifteen the supreme court 's decision to strike down the ban on same sex marriage my husband dave and i walk over to the steps of the supreme court to celebrate that decision with so many other people and i couldn 't help but think how far we came around lgbt rights and yet how far i was very open about my recovery and about the fact that i was a gay man and at no point during my confirmation process at least that i know of did the fact that i was a gay man come to bear on my candidacy or my fitness to do this job but addiction did at one point a congressional staffer said that there was no way that i was going to be confirmed by the united states senate because of my past despite the fact that i had been in recovery for over twenty years and despite the fact that this job takes a little bit of knowledge around addiction yet unfortunately too often it 's not talked about openly and honestly it 's whispered about we hear it from public officials and we hear it from family and friends and somehow we believe that we are less deserving today in the united states only one in nine people get care and treatment for their disorder one in nine think about that generally people with other diseases get care and treatment if you have cancer you get treatment if you but somehow people with addiction have to wait for treatment or often can 't get when they need it but we know that we can 't decades of scientific research has shown that this is a medical issue that this is a chronic medical condition that people inherit we 've developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to expand prevention services treatment services early intervention and recovery we see law enforcement and other first responders reversing overdoses with naloxone to give people a second chance for care the affordable care act unless we change the way that we view people with addiction years ago when i finally understood that i had a problem i was too afraid to ask for it i felt that people would think i was stupid that i was weak willed but i talk about my recovery because i want to make change i want us to see that we need to be open and candid about who we are and what we can do i am public about my own recovery not to be i am open about my own recovery to change public opinion to change public policy and to change the course of this epidemic and empower the millions of americans who struggle with this journey to be open and candid about who they are and all of us have the opportunity to change public opinion and to change public policy so when you see someone with an addiction think of a drunk or a junkie or an addict or an abuser see a person we can ensure that people get care when they need it just like any other disease we can be part of a growing unstoppable movement to have millions of americans enter recovery and put an end to this epidemic thank you very much"
