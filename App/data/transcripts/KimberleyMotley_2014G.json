  "transcript": "let me tell you a story about a little girl named naghma naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters every morning her father would wake up in the hopes he 'd be picked for construction work and on a good month he would earn fifty dollars naghma 's brother died and her mother became very ill after several months of waiting the neighbor became very impatient and he demanded that he be paid back and so the two men agreed to a jirga so simply put a jirga jirga is a form of mediation that 's used in afghanistan 's informal justice system at the jirga the men sat together and they decided that the best way to satisfy the debt would be if naghma married the neighbor 's 21 year old son she was six and from the comforts of our home we may look at these stories as another crushing blow to women 's rights and if you watched afghanistan on the news you may have this view that it 's a failed state and it goes without saying that giving a child to satisfy a debt is not only grossly immoral it 's illegal and i went there originally on this nine month program to train afghan lawyers in that nine months and i talked to many businesses that were also operating in afghanistan while gross and illegal punitive measures and so this put me on a quest for justness and what justness means to me the role of laws is to protect but it 's a global problem and so i started representing people like now since i 've been in afghanistan and since i 've been an attorney for over ten years i 've represented from ceos of fortune five hundred companies to ambassadors to little girls like naghma and with much success i work the system from the inside out and use the laws in the ways that they 're intended to be used i find that achieving justness in places like afghanistan is difficult and there 's three reasons and i find that this is a global problem the second issue is that even with laws on the books it 's often superseded or ignored by tribal customs i use existing laws we all need to create a global culture of human rights and be investors in a global human rights economy and by working in this mindset we can significantly improve justice globally now let 's get back to naghma several people heard about this story and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the $ two thousand five hundred debt so but in order to get involved what needed to happen we needed to get the village elders together we needed to get the tribal leaders together the religious leaders and then they also need to agree that i preside over it so after hours of talking and we did and and it was very important for me that they all and at the end of this jirga it was ordered by the judge and if they did it again that they would go to prison i 've been i 've had a grenade thrown at my office it didn 't go off though and as many risks as i take my clients take far greater risks because they have a lot more to lose if their cases go unheard or worse if they 're penalized for having me as their lawyer with every case that i take i realize that as much as i 'm standing behind my clients that they 're also standing behind and that 's what keeps me going law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us too often we receive information from journalists but we forget how that information was given according to the committee to protect journalists since two thousand he works for the new york times and unfortunately a few months ago he wrote an article that displeased people in the government as a result he was temporarily detained detained and he was illegally exiled out of the country i represent matt i 'm happy to say that as of a few days ago the afghan government formally invited him back into the country and they reversed their exile order of him if you censor one journalist then it intimidates others and soon nations are silenced it 's important that we protect our journalists and freedom of the press because that makes governments more accountable to us and more transparent and our right to receive information protects us and what were once individual problems are really now global problems for all of us two weeks ago afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of power and elected eight year old daughter only knows a black president and as she gets older she may question can a white guy be there are currently over two hundred and eighty million boys and girls who are married under the age of fifteen two hundred and eighty million child marriages prolong the vicious cycle lack of education at the age of twelve sahar was married they forced her into prostitution she was tortured she was severely beaten with metal rods they burned her body they tied her up in a basement and starved her they used pliers to take out her fingernails at one point she managed to escape and when she went there instead of protecting her they dragged her back to her husband 's house thankfully women for afghan women gave her a safe haven to go to i try to be very strong because that 's very important to me but seeing her how broken and very weak as she was was very difficult it took weeks for us to really get to what happened to her but finally she started opening up to me and when she opened up what i heard was she didn 't know what her rights were and so we decided to take this case to the supreme court now this is extremely significant because this is the first time that a victim of domestic violence in afghanistan was being represented by a lawyer a law that 's been on the books for years and years but until sahar had never been used but we used it for her case so there we were at the supreme court arguing in front of twelve afghan justices me as an american and sahar a young woman who when i met her couldn 't speak above a whisper and my girl told them that she wanted justice and she got it at the end of it all the court unanimously agreed that her in laws should be arrested for what her fucking brother should also be arrested for selling her and they agreed that she did have a right to civil compensation and by protecting sahar we are protecting ourselves worked in afghanistan for over six years now a lot of my family and friends think that what i do looks like this what i do looks like this now we can all do something but we can all be contributors to a global human rights economy and make governments more accountable to us as we are to them a few months ago a south african lawyer visited me in my office i wanted to see what a crazy person looked like and no matter what your ethnicity race they belong to us and fighting for justice is not an act of insanity businesses also need to get with the program a corporate investment in human rights is a capital gain on your businesses and whether you 're a business an ngo or a private citizen rule of law benefits all of us and by working together with a concerted mindset through the people public and private sector we can create a global human rights economy and all become global investors in human rights thank you"
