  "transcript": "the lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their now called reservations the subject of today 's slide show is located about seventy five miles southeast of the black hills in south dakota it is sometimes referred to as prisoner of war camp number three hundred and thirty four and it is where the lakota now live or of or of the standoff at oglala then you know pine ridge is ground zero for native issues in the us and that is a huge barrier on a native reservation i 've become very close with them but on pine ridge i will always be what is called is a lakota word that means non indian but another version of this word means the one who takes the best meat and that 's what i want to focus on the one who takes the best part of the meat it means greedy sitting in red velvet chairs and if we look at our lives we have indeed taken the best part of the meat so let 's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain and know that when you see these people 's faces they stand for all indigenous people the following is a time line of treaties made treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles i 'll begin in what is known as the bureau of indian affairs was created within the war department setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the native americans if the boundaries of this treaty had held and there is a legal basis that they should then this is what the us would look like today unleashed a flood of white settlers into native lands an uprising of santee sioux in minnesota ends with only two days after he signed the emancipation proclamation the treaties were out the in response three tribes led by the lakota chief red cloud attacked and defeated the us army many times over i want to repeat that part the lakota defeat the us army one thousand the government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states we promise that the powder river country will henceforth be closed to all whites the treaty seemed to be a complete victory for red cloud and the sioux in fact this is the only war in american history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy large numbers of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo eliminating a source of food clothing and shelter for the sioux the indian appropriation act makes all indians wards of the federal government the military issued orders forbidding western indians from leaving reservations all western indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war and we can 't have that we had plans custer recommends that congress find a way to end the treaties with the lakota as soon as possible war begins over the violation of the fort laramie treaty custer 's 7th cavalry was crushed at the battle of little big horn the great lakota warrior and chief named crazy horse surrendered at fort robinson he was later killed while in custody is also the year we found a way to get around the fort laramie treaties under a campaign known as sell or starve sign the paper or no food for your tribe only ten percent of the adult male population signed the fort laramie treaty called for at least three quarters of the tribe to sign away land communal ownership of reservation lands ends reservations are cut up into the american dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation once again the fat of the land goes to wasichu one thousand eight hundred and ninety a date i believe to be the most important in this slide show this is the year of the wounded knee massacre and massacred chief big foot and three hundred prisoners of war using a new rapid fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a hotchkiss gun for this so called battle twenty congressional medals of honor for valor were given to the 7th cavalry to this day day this is the most medals of honor world war two korea iraq or afghanistan the wounded knee massacre is considered the end of the indian wars but as a grave for all indigenous peoples the holy man black elk said i did not know then how much was ended when i look back now from this high hill of my old age i can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch and i can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard a people 's dream died there and it was a beautiful dream with this event a new era in native american history began everything can be measured before wounded knee and after because it was in with the fingers on the triggers of the hotchkiss guns that the us government openly declared its position on native rights so they brought out their cannons compared to an estimated eight million in the court determined that when the sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders the court stated that the black hills were the sioux refused the money with the rallying cry the black hills are not for sale forced migration and treaty violations the housing office is unable to build new structures and existing structures are falling apart and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families percent of homes on pine ridge have no electricity at least sixty percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold more than ninety percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line the infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the us national frequently grandparents are raising their grandchildren the life expectancy for men is between and forty eight years old the last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say my god what are these people doing to themselves they 're killing each other they 're killing themselves while we watch them die this is the legacy of manifest destiny long after the guards are gone these are the bones left after the best meat has been taken those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end as removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre i still have to ask you the question how should you feel about the statistics of today what is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that i just read to you and how much of this history do you need to own even is any of this your responsibility today content to be a witness just taking photographs the suffering of indigenous peoples not a simple issue to fix it or fighting a famine the fix as it 's called may be much more difficult for the dominant society than say a $ fifty check or a church trip to paint some graffiti covered so where does that leave us shrugging our shoulders in the dark the call to action i offer today my ted wish is this honor the treaties give back the black hills it 's not your business what they do with them"
