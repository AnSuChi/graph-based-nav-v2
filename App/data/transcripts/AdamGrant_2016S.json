  "transcript": "i want you to look around the room for a minute and try to find the most paranoid person here and then i want you to point at that person for me ok don 't actually do it and i find paranoia everywhere paranoia is caused by people that i call takers takers are self serving in their interactions it 's all about what can you do for me it 's somebody who approaches most interactions by asking what can i do for you i wanted to give you a chance to think about your own style we all have moments of giving and taking your style but i am convinced the longer it takes for you to laugh at this cartoon the more worried we should be that you 're a taker then there 's another kind of taker that we won 't be addressing today and that 's called a psychopath they choose this third style called matching and that seems like a safe way to live your life but is it the most effective and productive way to live your life maybe i studied dozens of organizations thousands of people i had engineers measuring their productivity i looked at medical students ' grades even salespeople 's revenue and unexpectedly the worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers they were so busy doing other people 's jobs they literally ran out of time and energy to get their own work completed school the lowest grades belong to the students who agree most strongly with statements like i love helping others which suggests the doctor you ought to trust is the one who came to med school with no desire to help anybody and then in sales too the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople and i asked him why do you suck at your job i didn 't ask it that way but what 's the cost of generosity in sales and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products laughter so just out of curiosity how many of you self identify more as givers than takers or matchers raise your hands ok it would have been more before we talked about these data but actually it turns out but they make their organizations better we have a huge body of evidence higher profits customer satisfaction and then unfortunately they suffer along the way so i wondered then if givers are the worst performers who are the best performers and they fall at the hands of matchers and so when you meet a taker you feel like it 's your mission in life to just punish the hell out of that person and that way justice gets served well most people are matchers and that means if you 're a but they 're not in every job in every organization i 've ever studied the best results belong to the givers again the same patterns were true for engineers ' productivity and which raises the question how do we create a world where more of these givers get to excel i want to talk about how to do that not just in businesses but also in nonprofits schools even governments are you ready i was going to do it anyway but i appreciate the enthusiasm they burn out so it 's the guy not the cat he 's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount of his time helping other people and his secret weapon you just have to find small ways to add large value to other people 's lives that could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other it could be sharing your knowledge or giving a little bit of feedback or it might be even something as basic you know i 'm going to try and figure out if i can recognize somebody whose work has gone unnoticed and those five minute favors are really critical to helping givers set boundaries and protect themselves where people ask a lot this may hit a little too close to home for some of you is they recognize that it 's ok to be a receiver too if you run an organization we can actually make this easier we can make it easier for people to ask for help a nurses did a lot of help seeking and on other floors they did very little of it the factor that stood out on the floors where help seeking was common where it was the norm was there was just one nurse whose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit when that role was available nurses said it 's not embarrassing it 's not vulnerable to ask for help it 's actually encouraged well being of givers it 's also critical to getting more people to act like givers because the data say that somewhere between seventy five and ninety percent of all giving in organizations starts with a request but a lot of people don 't ask they don 't want to look incompetent they don 't know where to turn they don 't want to burden others i figured but i was surprised to discover actually that that was not right that the negative impact of a taker on a culture is usually double to triple the positive impact of a giver but one good egg just does not make a dozen i don 't know what that means laughter but i hope you do no and you will see that the givers will stop helping they 'll say i 'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks why should i contribute whereas if you let one giver into a team you don 't get an explosion of of generosity more often people are like great that person can do all our work it 's about weeding out the takers if you can do that well you 'll be left with givers and so how do you catch a taker before it 's too late we 're actually pretty bad at figuring out who 's a taker especially on first impressions there 's a personality trait that throws us off it 's called agreeableness one the major dimensions of personality across cultures agreeable people are warm and friendly they 're nice they 're polite you find a lot of them in canada where there was actually a national contest to come up with a new canadian slogan and fill in the blank as canadian as i thought the winning entry was going to be as canadian as maple syrup or ice hockey but no canadians voted for their new national slogan to be i kid you not as you get this right away how could i ever say i 'm any one thing when i 'm constantly adapting to try to please other people disagreeable people do less of it they 're more critical skeptical challenging and far more likely than their peers to go to law school that 's not a joke that 's actually an empirical fact but then i gathered the data and i was stunned to find no correlation between those traits because it turns out that what are your intentions toward others you have to get to the moment every consultant in the room is waiting for and draw a two by two the agreeable givers are easy to spot they say yes to everything the disagreeable takers are also recognized quickly although you might call them by a slightly different we forget about the other two combinations there are disagreeable givers in our organizations there are people who are gruff and tough on the surface but underneath have others ' best interests at heart or as an engineer put it oh disagreeable givers like somebody with a bad user interface but a great operating system the ones who give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear we need to do a much better job valuing these people as opposed to writing them off early and saying must be a selfish taker the other combination we forget about is the deadly one the agreeable taker also known as the faker this is the person who 's nice to your face and then will stab you right in the back and my favorite way to catch these people in the interview process is to ask the question can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have fundamentally improved because takers are great at kissing up and then kicking down givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy who don 't have as much power so if we do all this well if we can weed takers out of organizations if we can make it safe to ask for help if we can protect givers from burnout and make it ok for them to be ambitious in pursuing their own goals as well as trying to help other people we can actually change the way that people define success instead of saying it 's all about winning a competition people will realize success is really more about contribution there 's a name for that it 's called is the delusional belief that other people are plotting your that they 're going around behind your back and saying exceptionally glowing things about you the great thing about a culture of givers is that 's not a delusion it 's reality and i hope you will help me create that world"
