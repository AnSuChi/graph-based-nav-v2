  "transcript": "this is me building a prototype for six hours straight this is slave labor to my own project this is what the diy and maker movements really look like and this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape change properties and even compute outside of silicon based matter there 's massive problems that aren 't being addressed by those nanoscale technologies if we look at construction and manufacturing there 's major inefficiencies energy consumption and excessive labor techniques in infrastructure let 's just take one example take piping in water pipes we have fixed capacity water pipes we bury them in the so i 'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials and the built environment self assembly which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure through only local interaction we need a few simple ingredients and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source and you can use and then you need smartly designed interactions and those interactions allow for error correction and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state so now i 'm going to show you a number of projects that we 've built from is that you take the three dimensional structure of a protein in this case it 's the crambin protein you take the backbone so no cross linking no environmental interactions and when i throw this up into the air and catch it it has the full three dimensional structure of the protein all of the intricacies and this gives us a tangible model and we 're also translating that into two dimensional systems so flat sheets that can self fold into three dimensional structures in three dimensions we did a project last year at and we gave them away to all the tedsters this is the and this is demonstrating that through random energy we can build non random shapes we even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale last year at ted long beach we built an installation that builds installations the so we built a large rotating chamber and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower adding energy to the system so remember i said 4d so today for the first time we 're unveiling a new project and it 's called 4d printing the idea behind 4d printing is that you take printing so you can deposit multiple materials we also worked with and this allows us to simulate this self assembly behavior and try to optimize which parts are folding when self assembly systems these are parts being printed here 's the first demonstration a single strand dipped in water that completely self folds on its own into the letters m i t i 'm biased this is another part single strand dipped in a bigger tank and we think this is the first time that a program and transformation has been embedded directly into the materials and we think there 's a few key sectors that have fairly near term applications one of those is in extreme environments these are scenarios where it 's difficult to build our current construction techniques don 't work it 's too large it 's too dangerous it 's expensive too many parts let 's go back to imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate so this isn 't expensive pumps or valves this is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own so i want to remind you today so i would like to invite you from whatever industry you 're from so that we can go from a world like this to a world that 's more like this thank you"
