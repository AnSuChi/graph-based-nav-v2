  "transcript": "which has an equally disturbing answer my topic is the secrets of domestic violence and the question i 'm going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks why i 'm just one woman with a story to tell i had moved to new york city for and i had a very big secret my secret was that i had this gun loaded with hollow point bullets pointed at my head many times the man who i loved more than anybody on earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than i can even remember i 'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love it may even be your story i have a b a in english from harvard college an mba in marketing from wharton business school i 've been married for almost twenty years to my second husband and i drive a honda so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone all races all religions all income and education levels it 's everywhere and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women that it 's a women 's issue not exactly over percent of abusers are men interdependent long term relationships in other words in families i would have told you myself that i was the last person on earth who would stay with a man who beats me but in fact i was a very typical victim because of my age i was women ages sixteen to twenty four are three times as likely i was also a very typical and he started chatting me up he told me two things one was that he too had just graduated from an ivy league school and that he worked at a very impressive wall street bank but what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he seemed so sweet one of the smartest things conor did from the very he did this especially at the beginning he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams as a writer and a woman in a way that no one else ever had and he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade even though he was very smart and he 'd spent which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future if you had told me funny sensitive man who adored me how short my skirts were i would have laughed at you because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor i didn 't know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim i also didn 't know that the second step step is to isolate the victim now conor did not come home one day and announce but i need to move into the next phase where i isolate you and i abuse you so i need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises conor came home one friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day his dream job and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive dysfunctional family and move to a tiny town in new england where he could start his life over with me by his side and i quit my job and conor and i left manhattan together i had no idea i was falling into crazy love that i was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical financial and psychological trap the next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts and here 's where those guns come in as soon as we moved to new england you know that place where connor was supposed to feel so safe he bought three guns he kept one in the glove compartment of our car but those guns were really a message for me and even though he hadn 't raised a hand to me my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding i was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment and i got frustrated and conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that i could not breathe or scream and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall and i i was sure we were going to live happily ever after and he loved me so much it was an isolated incident and he was never going to hurt me again i was driving to find a secret beach and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver 's side window and he threw a cold big mac in my face i was mistaken in thinking that i was unique and alone in this situation one in three american women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life and the cdc reports that fifteen million children are abused every year fifteen even though he held those loaded guns to my head poured coffee grinds on my head and i was the only person on earth who could help conor face his demons the other question everybody asks why didn 't i walk out i could have left any time because we victims know something you usually don 't it 's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her because then the abuser has nothing left to lose denial of and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time i was able to leave because of one final sadistic beating that broke through my denial realized that the man who i loved so much and i 'm here today because you all helped me we tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines self destructive women damaged goods the question why does she stay is code for some people for it 's her fault for staying as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us but since publishing crazy love i have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened happy lives as employees wives and mothers lives completely free of violence a typical domestic violence survivor how stupid was she i 've actually been talking about you i promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves i was able to end my own crazy love story i 'm still breaking the silence today it 's my way of helping other victims and it 's my final request of you talk about what you heard here abuse thrives only in silence you have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it we victims need everyone we need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence recast survivors as wonderful lovable people recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously show victims a safe way out together we can make our beds our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be thank you"
