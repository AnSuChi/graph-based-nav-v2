  "transcript": "ninety percent of my photographic process is in fact not photographic it involves a campaign of letter writing research and phone calls to access my subjects which can range from the most i personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth but there are multiple truths attached to every image the viewer and the context in which it is presented over a five year period following september 11th when the american media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders most notably weapons of mass destruction i chose to look inward at that which was integral to america 's foundation mythology and daily functioning and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge and i wanted to see the center with my own eyes but what i came away with is a photograph and it 's just another place from which to observe and the outsider can never really reach the core it 's titled an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar and it 's comprised of nearly this is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at hanford site in washington state where there are over one thousand nine hundred stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water a human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america which you can see here and a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text so i create these two poles every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text and what i 'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and how the image is but in this context i 'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics this is a 21 year old palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty hymenoplasty is a surgical this is a jury simulation deliberation room and you can see beyond that two way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror and they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they 're hoping for f kennedy international and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still life painting so i spent some time with the and it 's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro american thoughts and aesthetics this is the forensic anthropology research facility and on a six acre plot there are approximately seventy five cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers and in this particular this is the only federally funded site and part of the work that i hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can 't find any discernible formula in how these things they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security and you can 't completely understand how information is being distributed these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic and in a lot of the government and technology sites but stuff did feel like it could have been taken thirty or forty years ago like it was locked in the cold war era this is a braille edition of playboy magazine and and the publications they and playboy is always in the top few but you 'd be surprised they don 't do the photographs it 's just the text this is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into america are required to undergo a 30 day quarantine where they are tested for diseases including exotic newcastle disease and avian influenza this film and the air armament center and the film was shot on seventy two millimeter government issue film and that red dot is a marking on the government issue film all living white tigers in north america are the result of selective inbreeding that would be and the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth it 's a very violent process that is little known and the white tiger is obviously celebrated in forms of entertainment he has since passed away but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities this on a lighter note is at and it 's shown here in its true orientation in the context of star wars return and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet it 's a military operations on urbanized terrain site essentially they 've simulated a city for urban combat set up of mosques in afghanistan or iraq and i worked with mehta vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice and we put that wall around the world church of god and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for and alhurra is a sponsored arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over twenty two countries in the arab world it runs twenty four hours a day commercial photography had been used to create a fantasy violent crimes which can lead to severe even lethal consequences the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement 's use of images but through exposure to composite sketches polaroids mug shots and line ups eyewitness testimony can change i 'll give you an example from a case a woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array and a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory if there ever was an actual frederick daye who is photographed at his alibi location where thirteen witnesses placed him at the time of the crime he was convicted by an now dna exonerated frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison but the victim refused to press charges because because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of frederick 's and i photographed all of the wrongfully wrongfully convicted at sites that came to came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction the scene of arrest the scene of misidentification the alibi location so photographing there i was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction in both his life and in photography larry mayes i photographed at the scene of arrest where he hid between two mattresses in gary indiana in this very room to hide from the police he ended up serving eighteen and a half years of an eighty year sentence for rape and robbery the victim failed to identify larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification days later from larry youngblood served eight years of a ten and half year sentence in arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a ten year old boy at a carnival ron williamson ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club and served eleven years of a death and the state 's key witness in ron 's case was in the end the actual perpetrator ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28 year old woman i photographed him at the scene of arrest timothy durham who i photographed at his alibi location where eleven witnesses placed him at the time of the crime was convicted of three point five years of a three thousand two hundred and twenty year sentence for several charges of rape and robbery he had been misidentified by an victim but said he looked too old the police went and found a photograph of troy webb from four years earlier which they entered into a photo array days later and he was positively identified"
