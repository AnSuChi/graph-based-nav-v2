  "transcript": "they 're called millennium development goals and the reason i really like these goals is that there are eight of them specifying eight different goals the united nations has said that there are so many things needed protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade the aim here is to reduce child mortality ninety to two thousand and fifteen that 's a four percent reduction per year and this with measuring that 's what makes the difference between and what i 'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in asia in the middle east in latin america and east so there 's good news but then i hear people saying there is no progress in africa come with me to the wonderful world of statistics i bring you to the webpage where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries it 's done by take kenya as an example here you see the data don 't panic don 't panic now i 'll help you through this it looks nasty like in in college when you didn 't like statistics from where do the data come there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it 's sent to the statistical office countries like kenya still don 't have that level of organization it exists but it 's not complete because so many deaths occur in the home what we rely on is not an incomplete system we have interviews how many children did you have are they alive if they died at what age and what year and then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country so they can only be done and all these colored lines here this was when the experts in the u n have got these surveys in place in their database then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line and the trend line looks like this see here it 's the best fit they can get of this point but watch out they continue the line beyond the last point out into and they estimated that in two thousand and eight kenya had per child mortality of one hundred and twenty eight because we could see this this i was so happy this was the estimate of the new survey and on friday we got the new trend line it was down here isn 't it nice isn 't it nice yeah so we but now when you have this trend line how do we measure progress i 'm going into some details here because [ the ] u n do it like this they start [ in ] one thousand nine hundred and ninety they measure to two thousand and nine they say zero point nine percent no progress that 's unfair it and you can see what 's happening now they have two point four percent we have a decent trend it and the reason here for africa is especially important because ' 90s was a bad decade not only so look at the average here this is the average for all of sub saharan africa and [ the ] u n says it 's a reduction with one point eight percent now this sounds a little theoretical so they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [ the ] economy we so we we calculate the percent reduction per year but it 's sort of the same percentage if your economy grows with four percent you ought to reduce child mortality four percent if it 's used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want is this fair now to measure this over nineteen years an economist would never do that only one point two percent whereas now but even this is not a fair representation of africa because it 's an average still here child death i give you congo which and vaccinations started smallpox was eradicated hygiene and they leveled off here you can see it doesn 't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement time has come to stop thinking about their countries are so i can tell you that the economy in greece and sweden are very different so let me show the wider picture my country sweden one thousand eight hundred we were up there what a strange personality disorder we must have counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate and eventually soon they started to get better and better here and here we got better education and we got health service we never had a war sweden was in peace all this time but look the rate of lowering in sweden was not fast sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early we had primary school actually started in one thousand eight hundred and forty two you have to realize that the investments we do in progress are not about just five years it 's long term investments and sweden never reached [ the ] millennium development goal rate three point one percent when i calculated so we are off track that 's what sweden is we want others to be better than we were and indeed others have been better let me show you thailand see what a success story thailand from the and i 'll give you another story egypt the most hidden glorious success in public health and malaria and a lot of problems and then they got the aswan dam they got electricity in their homes increased kenya is now speeding up here we have a problem we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill let me now bring you to a wider picture a wider picture of child mortality i 'm going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here this axis here is child mortality and here i have the family size the relationship between child mortality and family size children per woman six seven eight children per woman this is once again one thousand nine hundred and sixty fifty years ago each bubble is a country the color you can see a continent the dark blue here is sub saharan africa and or very high child mortality and family size they had low child mortality and small families what has happened this is what happened now i start the world here we come down it got down there china comes into the western box here india is approaching the first african countries coming into the western box and we get a lot a new neighbors welcome to a decent life come on we want everyone down there this is the vision we have the first african countries here are coming in there we are today it 's very good levels and trends in child mortality except this page it 's a categorization of countries it labels developing countries republic of korea south korea huh how the heck could they be the rest here is good the rest is good we have to have a modern concept which fits to the data and we have to realize that we are all going to into this down to here what is the importance now with the relations here look you can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and it 's very clear that this is what happens and a very important piece of research came out on friday from the institute of health metrics and evaluation in seattle showing that almost fifty percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education that is when we get girls in school we 'll get an impact fifteen to twenty years later but we must measure the impact over 10 year periods it 's fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together and of course lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance but it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind because it 's about the environment we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don 't stabilize the world population let 's do it thank you very much"
