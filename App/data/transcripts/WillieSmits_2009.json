  "transcript": "and somebody stuck a cage in my face and in between those slits were the saddest eyes i 've ever seen there was a very sick orangutan baby my first encounter that evening i came back to the market in the dark and and sure enough i found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap of massaged her forced her to drink until she finally started and this is matahari her dodoy i have almost one thousand babies in my two centers no no wrong it 's horrible it 's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild it this is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together especially for oil palm to provide biofuel for western countries is what 's causing these problems and those are the peat swamp forests on twenty meters of peat the largest accumulation of organic material in the world when you open this for growing oil palms you 're creating volcanoes that are emitting so much co2 that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world after china and the united and these are horrible images i 'm not going to talk too long about it to live out there in the forest that still have to go through that process and i don 't know anymore where to put them so i decided that i had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing in that way the loss of habitat and all those victims so i created the place samboja lestari and the idea was no one will have an excuse to say yeah but no everyone should be able to follow this so we 're in east borneo this is the place i started as you can see there 's only yellow terrain there 's nothing left just a bit of grass there in two thousand and two we had about fifty percent of the people jobless there there was a huge amount of crime people spent so much of their money on health there was no agricultural productivity left this was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife this was like a biological desert when i stood there in the four years later we have created jobs for about three thousand people the climate has changed i will show you no more flooding no more fires it 's no longer the poorest district and there is a huge development of biodiversity we 've got over one thousand species we have we created a huge economic failure in this forest but we saw the same thing we had slash and burn agriculture people cannot afford there is this one green blop on the earth 's surface and then only we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary but we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside profit planet principles but we do it in addition to a sure legal status because if the forest belongs to the state people say it belongs to me it belongs to everyone you formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the if you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil on a clay soil on a steep slope on flat soil you put those different recipes if you combine them out of that comes a business plan comes a work plan and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have and you can do it this is how it looks like in practice we have this grass we want to get rid of it exudes [ unclear ] like compounds from the roots the acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro climate to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses and after eight years they might actually yield which we can do with bamboo peels it 's an old temple building technique from japan but bamboo is very so if we would plant that in the beginning we would for when the timber becomes available so the idea is how to integrate these flows in space over time and with the limited means you have so the crop fertilizer organic material is useful for the agricultural crops for the people but also helps the trees the farmers have free land so beautiful what a theory but is it really that easy not really because if you looked at what happened this is because we have ten thousand of those fires that you also have in pennsylvania here in the united states and once the soil gets dried you 're in a dry season you get cracks oxygen goes in flames come out and the problem starts all we lost all the crops no so these fires are really the first things to work on it goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall going to the sea so you have to do it with the local people these sugar palms turn out to be fire resistant also by the way and they provide a lot of income for local people this is what it looks like the people have to tap them because you can tap them on a daily basis you don 't need to harvest so this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics which is still unexploited and doing it in combination so we bought that land and if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil and we were actually monitoring measuring we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that we grow the slower growing forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light then and they become like nutrient pumps you need the bacteria to fix nitrogen and without those microorganisms you won and then we started planting only one thousand trees a day we could have planted many many more but we didn 't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable we didn 't want to lose the people that and we do a lot of work here we use indicator plants to look at what soil types or what vegetables this is what it looks like in reality you have this irregular ring around it with strips of if you look at the number of tree species we have in europe for instance from the urals up to england you know how many in this nursery we 're going to grow ten times more than the number of species can you imagine you do need to know what you are working with but it 's that diversity putting up the buffer zone producing your and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used in the beginning maybe pineapples and beans and corn in the second phase there will be bananas and papayas later on there will be chocolate and chilies and then slowly the trees start taking over bringing in produce from the fruits from the timber from the fuel wood and finally the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income and in that area we started growing some and this is after two years and that 's green if you look from the tower and three years later one hundred and thirty seven species of birds are living here so we lowered air temperature three to five degrees celsius air humidity this transponder that we operate with the european space agency it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation we can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology we actually have it already with google earth if you would use a little bit of your sustainably produced which company is stealing the timber and you could save so much more carbon than with any but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back and biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced how many medicines can be kept here and finally i made it into the rain machine because now we looked at the clouds above this forest we looked at the reforestation area area and the open area and look at these images raindrops are not formed from ice crystals which is the case in the temperate zones you need the trees with [ unclear ] chemicals and look and you can see that that trend is continuing where it used to be the driest place but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there so you can actually change the climate when there are you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above so to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do because we actually can make that difference we have this road going around the area which brings the people electricity and water from our own area we have the zone with the sugar palms and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans that we provide with a place to live in the middle and the people apart and inside we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive because for the last twelve years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back and it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees you have the shade trees planted in year one then and after a few years and they can build a house they have some fuel wood to cook cultural values there is no simple one recipe for one place you also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt that it 's transparent if one member trespasses the agreement and does cut down the other nineteen members have to decide what 's going to happen to him if the group doesn 't take action the other thirty three groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn 't comply so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system in summary if you look at it in year one the people can sell their land to get income but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation the working with the orangutans and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft they also get free land in between the trees where they can grow their crops they can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project they get building material for houses a contract for selling the sugar so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally they get all these other benefits money they get education it 's a great deal and everything is based upon that one thing so if we want to help the orangutans what i actually set out to do we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit now i think the real key to doing it to give a simple answer is integration i hope if you want to know more"
