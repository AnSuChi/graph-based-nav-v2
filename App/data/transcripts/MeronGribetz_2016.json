  "transcript": "today 's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how terrible they really are i 'd like to talk to you today about this problem and how we can fix it with neuroscience first i 'd like to take you back to a frosty night in harlem in two thousand and eleven that had a profound impact on me and i was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms to one day replace computers and just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation of course his phone lights up and then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes keep going i 'm with you and that dichotomy between how crappy i and the more i thought of it the more i realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together see they were connected around something just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire whether you 're sending an email to your wife or you 're composing a symphony or just consoling a friend you 're doing it in pretty much the same way you 're hunched over these rectangles fumbling with buttons and menus we should use machines that bring our work back into the world we let 's try and i can see my very hands and in three two one we 're going to see an immersive hologram appear a very realistic hologram appear in front of me of our very glasses i 'm wearing on my head right now and i can use my hands to very nicely kind of move it around we 're going to come back to this in just a bit my mom is an architect naturally the first thing i imagined was she 's actually touching graphics right now and selecting an interior decor this was all shot through a gopro through our very glasses and this next use case is very personal to me it 's professor adam gazzaley 's glass brain project courtesy of as a neuroscience student i would always fantasize about the ability to to learn and memorize these complex brain structures with an actual machine where i could touch and but to me it 's part of a much more important story a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with instead of the other way around now in the next few years humanity 's going to go through a shift i think we 're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytellers for painters for brain surgeons for interior decorators and maybe for all of us here today and what i think we need to do as a community is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience instead of gamifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information and that 's what i 'm very passionate about much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware we buy it for the operating system as a neuroscientist i always dreamt of building the ios of the mind if you will and i don 't know about you but living inside of windows scares me and the principle we all revolve around is what 's called the neural path of least resistance at every turn we 're connecting the ios of the brain with our brain on for the first time our brain 's terms in other words we 're building a system that you 've always known how to use we 're going against the neural path of least resistance and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them you could put your holographic tesla that you 're shopping for or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show get it back the second interface guideline we call touch to see turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception that 's the sense of our body parts in space so by touching our work directly to control it better we 're also going to understand it much more deeply hence touch to see and this leads me to our third guideline the holographic campfire from our first story mirror neuron subsystem suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other 's faces and hands in instead of being distracted by external devices so again our favorite interface the ios of the mind i 'm going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this i 'm now with you i 'm in the moment we 're connecting and i can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand but it 's not enough to see things alone so in a second my co founder ray is going to make a 3d call ray i can see this guy in front me in full ray great we 're live today mg ray give thanks ray ray you 're welcome mg this is the message that i discovered in that bar in two thousand and eleven the future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens it 's right here inside of us so if there 's one idea that i could leave you with here today it 's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future it 's right here in two thousand and sixteen which is why all hundred of us at meta including the administrative staff the executives the designers the engineers before thank you very much so help me out on on one thing because there 've been a few augmented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there and there 's sometimes a debate among technologists about are we really on screen there 's this issue of field of view that somehow would actually see wearing the glasses we want to try to simulate the experience for the world that we 're actually seeing through the glasses and not cut any corners ca thank you so much"
