  "transcript": "well the conventional approach to post conflict situations has rested on kind of three principles the first principle is so the first thing that is prioritized is politics try and build a political settlement first but only for a short time so get peacekeepers there but get them home as soon as possible so it 's an election i think that approach denies reality we see that there is no quick fix there 's certainly no quick security fix and they stay high regardless of the political does an election produce an accountable and and the loser is unreconciled it 's not the politics first it 's actually the politics last the politics become easier as the decade progresses if you 're building on a foundation of security and economic development the rebuilding of prosperity the mentality and that doesn 't produce a and so the mentality has to shift from zero sum to before you can get a productive politics we need so that is what you get when you face reality but the objective of facing reality is to change reality and so now let me suggest two complimentary approaches to changing the reality of the situations the first is to recognize the interdependence of three key actors who the security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security it does but it needs to be done long term it needs to be a than just a couple of years that 's one actor the security council the second actor different cast of guys is the donors the donors provide and then they got bored they moved on to some other situation recovery is a slow process there are no quick processes in economics except you can do that quite fast and then the third key actor is the there are two key things it 's got to do one is it 's got to do economic reform not fuss about the political constitution it 's got to reform economic policy why because during conflict governments snatch short term opportunities the chickens have come home to roost so this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy the inclusion agenda doesn 't come from elections elections so the the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside if the if you don 't get the policy reform so we should recognize that interdependence and so we need a post conflict compact the united nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts it 's called the peace building commission be ideal to have a and now let me turn to the second approach which is complimentary and that is to focus on a few critical objectives post conflict situation and indeed unfortunately if you navigate by needs because in these situations needs are so we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical and i want to suggest that in the typical post conflict situation three things are critical one is improvements in basic services especially health which is a disaster during conflict so jobs and clean government those are the three critical priorities so i 'm going to talk a little about each of them jobs and why are jobs so important jobs for whom especially jobs for young men the reason that they so often revert to conflict it 's because young men get upset and so we need a process of generating it 's not sustainable in fact you 're building a long term liability by inflating civil service but getting the private sector to expand is also difficult because any activity which is open to international trade is basically going to be uncompetitive in a post conflict situation these are not environments where you can build export manufacturing there 's one sector which and which is in any case a sensible sector to expand the construction sector has a vital role obviously in reconstruction you encounter a lot of bottlenecks basically prices soar what might the bottlenecks be just think what you have to do successfully to build a using a lot of labor the mundane skills of the construction sector we need bricklayers without borders to rebuild the skill set if we do that we get the improvements in public infrastructure the restoration of public infrastructure let me turn from jobs to the to the second objective which is improving basic social services and to date there has been a sort of a schizophrenia in the donor community as to how to build basic services in on the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of scandinavia in the 1950s lets develop and it 's schizophrenic because and so and so what i 'd suggest is it 's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three the planning function and policy function stays with the ministry local communities and especially donor money to the retail providers rather than independent of it another is you can make ngos accountable so they have to compete against each other like oxfam are very keen on this idea they want to have so they wouldn 't be provided thanks to the united states government and some ngo finally clean government clean means follow their money the typical government is so short of money that it needs our money just to be on a life support you can 't get the basic functions of the state done unless we put money into the core budget of these countries but if we put money into the core budget we know that there aren 't the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent and if all we do is put money in and close our eyes it 's not just that the money is wasted that 's the least of the problems it it 's captured by so building clean government means yes provide money but also provide a lot of scrutiny which means a lot of paddy ashdown who was the grand high nabob of bosnia to the united nations in his book about his experience he said i realize what i needed was accountants without borders to follow that money that 's the let me wrap up this is the they wouldn 't be"
