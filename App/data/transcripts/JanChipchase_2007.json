  "transcript": "and and and you know but i 've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there and it 's increasingly in places like india china six point three billion people about three billion people by the end of this year will have cellular and it 'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that and i mention this because if we want to design for that future we need to figure out what those people are about our research often starts with if you think of everything in your life that you own when you walk out that door what do you consider to take with you and of that stuff what do you actually use so this is interesting to us because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value i go in people 's bags i look in people 's pockets and and we do all this and it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff ok that 's fair but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are across cultures and across gender and across contexts most people will say keys money and if they own one a mobile phone i mean i couldn 't take your phones off you if i wanted to you 'd probably kick me out or something and it turns out keys provide an access to shelter and warmth transport as well if you prefer this kind of maslow 's hierarchy of needs those three objects but they 're very good in particular it 's the mobile phone 's ability to allow people to transcend space and time and what i mean by that is you know which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected and they value that connectivity and the mobile phone in addition is both personal and so it also gives you a degree of privacy and it 's convenient you don 't need to ask permission from anyone you can just go ahead and do it right however for these things to help us survive it depends on them being carried and it 's a pretty big but we forget we 're human that 's what we do it 's one of our features i think quite a nice feature and the point of reflection and that 's that moment when you 're walking out of a space and you turn around and you look back into the space the next thing is most of you if you have a stable home life and what i mean is that you don 't travel all the time and always and a center of gravity is where you keep these objects and these things don 't stay in the center of gravity but over time they gravitate there it so when we did this research we found the absolutely one hundred percent guaranteed way to never forget anything ever ever and that is quite simply to have nothing to remember laughter but is in fact about the art of delegation it 's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people and turns out delegation if you want it to be can be the solution for pretty much everything or at least not yet maybe sometime in the future we so this is probably the thing i 'm most passionate about is the research that we 've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate so the u n estimated this is two thousand and four figures and one of the things we were looking at is if you can 't read and write you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with it could be a phone number it could be an e mail address it could be a postal address simple question if you can 't read and write how do you manage your contact information and the fact is that millions of people do it just from a design perspective we didn 't really understand how they did it and so that 's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing so they delegate that part of the task process to other people the stuff that they can 't do themselves use those i 'm in kampala and it 's quite likely that they 'd have a quite simple mobile phone as as a phone kiosk so what i do is i buy a prepaid card like this and then you the kiosk operator takes ten or twenty percent commission and it turns anyone and even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure they wouldn 't necessarily be considered viable customers they 're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts there 's a second thing i like about this and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication i know i could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this this is just street up innovation so it turns out the street is a never ending source of inspiration for us and ok if you break one of these things here you return it to the carrier they 'll give you and this is where they take the stuff that breaks and they fix it and they put it back into circulation and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together and it 's written in chinese and english they also write them in hindi you can subscribe to these it boils down to someone on the street with a small flat surface a screwdriver toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads because they often get dust on the contact heads and it 's all about the social network of the knowledge floating around and and i know what you 're asking did i test it i 'm not going to answer that ok but i look at something like this and i consider the the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process and we look at this and we think well how does that apply for example for the design of the lessons from this apply to the design of online services this is a pair of underpants from you know why would someone design underpants with a pocket if we were to to take all the functionality in things like this and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network how would we prioritize where to put stuff and yes this is quite trivial but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of and what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural uganda this doesn 't have this has so what does it mean when people 's identity is mobile it isn 't fixed your notion of identity this is how and then i go to this this picture here which is the one that i started with and this is it 's from a study we did into illiteracy and it 's a guy in a teashop you can see the chai being poured in the background and he somehow has the appreciation and it 's not necessarily the same values but some kind of values of livestrong to actually go out and purchase them and actually display them for me this kind of personifies this connected world where everything the title of this presentation is connections and consequences and it 's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it 's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time and i know ted is about big ideas but if you want a big idea you need to embrace everyone on the planet that 's the first thing the second thing is the immediacy of objects as these become smaller as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater things like banking identity these things quite simply move very quickly around the and so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid in a way that we just totally cannot conceive when you get it to six point three billion and the growth in the world 's population the next thing is that however we design this stuff carefully design this stuff the street will take it and will figure out ways to innovate as long as it meets base needs the ability to and it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate and if we 're smart we 'll look at this stuff to enable it to inform and both what we design and how we design"
