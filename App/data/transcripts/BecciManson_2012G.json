  "transcript": "we 're pale gray creatures we hide in dark windowless rooms and generally but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography i watched from home as the rest of the world did as the tragic events unfolded in japan working as part of the response efforts i along with hundreds of other volunteers knew we couldn 't just sit at home so on may the 13th i made my way to the town of funato it 's a small fishing town in we pulled debris from canals and ditches we cleaned schools we and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation we cleared tons and tons and we loved it all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things they 'd been finding photos and handing them in to various places around the different now it wasn 't until this point that i realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt as they had run from the wave and for their lives absolutely everything they had everything had to be left behind at the end of my first week there i found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town i was helping clean the communal communal onsen the huge giant bathtubs this happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos this is where people were handing them in and i was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand cleaning them now it was emotional and it was inspiring and i 've always heard about thinking outside the box but it wasn 't until i had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened i couldn 't help but think as a retoucher that i could fix that tear and mend that scratch and i knew hundreds of people who could do the same so that evening i just reached out on facebook and asked a few of them and by morning the the response had been so overwhelming and so positive i knew we had to give it a go so we started retouching photos but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl 's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy otherwise that little girl isn 't going to look like that little girl anymore and surely that 's as tragic as having the photo damaged and eighty people wanted to help from twelve different countries within two weeks i had one hundred and fifty people wanting to join in further north to a town called yamada once a week we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up where people were reclaiming their photos the older ladies sometimes hadn 't seen a scanner before uploaded to a cloud server it would be downloaded the time it took however to get it back is a completely different story and it depended obviously on the damage involved it could take an hour it could take weeks it could take the kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand drawn or pieced together picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn 't damaged it was very time consuming covered in sometimes even in oil all of which over time is going to continue to damage them so hand cleaning them was a huge part of the project we couldn 't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned dry and reclaimed now we were lucky with our hand cleaning we had an amazing local woman who who guided us it 's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos as my team leader wynne once said it 's like doing a tattoo on someone you don 't get a chance to mess the lady who brought us these photos was lucky as far as the photos go and remake the whole photo when she collected the photos from us she shared a bit of her story with us her photos were found by her husband 's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded her two little boys not so little anymore but her two boys the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son 's 14th birthday for her despite all of this something he could look at again something he remembered from before that that wasn 't still scarred from that day in march when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed after six months in japan one thousand one hundred volunteers had passed through all hands hundreds of whom had helped us over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get ninety families hundreds of photographs back fully restored and retouched we take photos constantly a photo is a reminder of someone or something a place a relationship a loved one the last thing we would grab and the first thing you 'd go back to look for that 's all this project was about about restoring those little bits of when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it for some of them it 's given them a connection to something bigger giving something back using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin the day i finally got back from japan after six months"
