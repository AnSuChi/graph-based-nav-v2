  "transcript": "which was created for humanity to really see and so unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste it wasn 't until we really got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself that we could understand our planet as a limited condition the digital universe atlas has been built at the american museum of natural history we maintain put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth nasa supported this work twelve years ago as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do but what you see here is the result of actually internships that we hosted with linkoping university i 've had twelve students work on this for their graduate work and the result has been this software called uniview and a company called sciss in sweden so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live captured this live from my laptop and it was done as a collaborative project with the rubin museum of himalayan art and so as we move out we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies as we see here light travel time giving you a sense of how far away we are as we move out the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long we 're essentially backing up into the past we back so far up we 're finally seeing a containment around us the afterglow of the big bang this is the background if we were outside this but this our containment of the visible universe we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see coming back quickly we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning but these are positions the latest positions of and our sun here obviously with our own solar system what you 're going to see we 're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system these are the paths of voyager one voyager two pioneer eleven and pioneer ten the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system picking up earth this map p i for the cassini mission but here we see the complex trajectory of the cassini mission diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase this software allows us to come close and look and we network domes and we can network between domes and classrooms we 're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub saharan planetarium in ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in columbia and a high school in cambodia the cambodians have actually controlled the hayden planetarium from their high school photographed by the aqua satellite but through the uniview software so you 're seeing the edge of the earth this is nepal this is in fact right here is the valley right here in tibet but we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the ganges valley down below in india this is nepal and tibet and just in closing i 'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out so i 'd like to just say that what the world needs now is is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is we carry that in us and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all i think in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe thank you"
