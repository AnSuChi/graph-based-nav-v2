  "transcript": "grew to be around thirty times the mass of our sun and lived for a very long time she reached the end of her regular star days and in the process releasing a tremendous amount of energy outshining the rest of the galaxy and emitting and she evolved into another role in our galaxy but the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme the interior of the star collapses under its own weight and it starts rotating ever faster like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body powerfully its magnetic field and some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter and the magnetic field is increased even further in that way our star had extra energy to outshine the rest of the galaxy in brightness and gamma ray emission the most energetic events ever measured by astronomers carry the name gamma ray bursts because we observe them as bursts most or explosions most strongly measured gamma ray light our star like the one in our story that became even though we depend we rely on other methods in order we can only see an itty bitty tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light yet as astronomers we study a wider range of light and we depend on other methods to do that on the screen it may look like this you 're seeing a plot it is a gamma ray light curve sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time and on the i lost my sight i completely lost my sight because of extended illness i lost the opportunity to see this plot it was a very strong transition i wanted to experience the spacious wonder the excitement the joy produced by the detection of such a titanic celestial event i thought long and hard about it when i suddenly realized that all a light curve is is a table of numbers converted into a visual plot i achieved access to the data and today i 'm able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer using sound what people have been able to do mainly visually for hundreds of years now i do it using this is scientific data converted into sound and it 's mapped in pitch the process is called so listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst when i examine the very and because you 're sighted i 'm giving you a red line i think you heard it right so what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order which are things it transmits power with frequency and field distribution determined by the dimensions you may remember that we were talking about a if this is the case then outflows from the exploding star may be associated with this gamma ray burst what does that mean listening to this very gamma ray burst brought us to the notion that the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display may also support sighted astronomers in the search for more information in the data i worked on analyzing measurements from other telescopes and my experiments demonstrated that when you use sound as an adjunctive visual display astronomers can find more information in this now more accessible data set this ability to transform data into sound gives astronomy a tremendous power of transformation and the fact that a field that is so visual may be improved in order to include anyone with interest in understanding what lies in the heavens is a spirit lifter when i lost my sight i noticed that i didn 't have access to the same amount and quality of information a sighted astronomer had it was not until we innovated with regained the hope to be a productive member yet information access is not the only area in astronomy where where this is important the situation is systemic and scientific fields are not keeping up is something changeable anyone may develop a disability at any point let 's think about for example scientists that are already at the top of their careers what happens to them if they develop a disability will they feel excommunicated as i did based on interest and not based on potential barriers while other countries told me that the study of perception techniques in order to study astronomy data is not relevant to astronomy because there are no blind astronomers in the field south africa said we want people with disabilities to contribute to the field right now i 'm working at the south african astronomical observatory at the office of astronomy for development there sonification techniques and analysis methods to impact the students of the athlone school for the the blind these students will be learning radio astronomy and they will be learning the sonification methods in order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy from the sun known as coronal mass ejections what we learn with these students these students have multiple disabilities and coping strategies that will be accommodated what we learn with these students will and this is happening right now i think it belongs to the people and it has to be available to everyone because we are all natural explorers where people encourage respect and respect each other where people exchange strategies and discover together if people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field an explosion a huge titanic burst i am sure"
