  "transcript": "like to do pretty much what i did the first time which is to choose a light hearted theme last time i talked about death and dying but it has to be technological so i 'll talk about electroshock therapy you know ever since man had any notion that some of his other people his colleagues he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits getting into the body so the way of treating these diseases in early times was to in some way or other exorcise those evil spirits and this is still going on as you know in about four hundred and fifty bc with hippocrates and those boys they tried to look for herbs plants that would literally shake the bad spirits out so they found certain plants that could cause convulsions and the herbals the botanical books of up to the late middle ages the renaissance are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out finally in about the sixteenth century a physician whose name was theophrastus bombastus aureolus von hohenheim called paracelsus a name probably familiar to some people here good old paracelsus found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion can you imagine your closet pulling out a mothball and chewing on it if you 're feeling depressed it 's better than prozac but i wouldn 't recommend it and so people italian psychiatrists who were largely treating depression began to notice among their patients who were also epileptics that if they had an epileptic a series of epileptic fits a lot of them in a row the depression would very frequently lift not only would it we 've got electricity we 'll plug somebody into the wall that always makes so they went to the police and they said we know that at the rome railroad station there are all these lost souls wandering around muttering gibberish can you bring one of them to us someone who is as the italians say cagoots so they found this cagoots guy a 39 year old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic who was known had been known for months to be laid him down on a table connected his temples to a very small source of current they thought well we 'll try fifty five volts two tenths of a second that 's not going to do anything terrible to him so they did that well i have the following from a firsthand observer who told me this about thirty five i was thinking about these things for some research project of mine he said this fellow remember he wasn 't even put to sleep after this major grand mal convulsion sat right up looked at these three fellas and said ' what the fuck are you assholes trying to do ' if i could only say that in italian so they they plugged him in again and this time they used one hundred and ten volts for half a second after it was over he began speaking like he was perfectly well he relapsed a little bit they gave him a series of treatments within a few months it returned but they wrote a paper about this and everybody in the western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed but it was pretty clear in the ' 30s and by the middle of the therapy was very very effective in the treatment of depression and of course in those days there were no antidepressant drugs and it became very very popular they would anesthetize people bones were broken especially in old fragile people couldn 't use it and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion an electroencephalographic convulsion you could see it on the brain waves without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes the first antidepressants came out tofranil was the first in the late there were others and they were very effective and patients ' rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things that they would witness and so the whole idea of electroconvulsive electroshock therapy disappeared and the reason that it has had a renaissance is that probably about ten percent of the people severe depressives do not respond regardless of what is done for them now i 'm telling you this story because actually ever since richard called me and asked me to talk about to talk about something that would be new to this audience that we had never talked about never written about i 've been planning this moment this reason really is that i am a man who almost thirty years ago had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock i was it was dreadful there are i 'm sure enough divorced people in this room to know about who knows what being someone who had had a very difficult childhood a very difficult adolescence it had to do with not quite poverty but close it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english no one could read or write english it had to do with death and disease and lots of other things i was a little prone to depression which was inevitably not to be saved i would schedule all my major surgical cases i was scheduling them for twelve one o 'clock in the afternoon because i couldn 't get out of bed before about eleven o 'clock and anybody who 's been depressed here knows what that 's like i couldn 't even pull the covers off myself well you 're in a university medical center where everybody knows everybody and it 's perfectly clear to my colleagues i clearly became increasingly depressed until i thought my god i can 't work anymore and in fact it didn 't make any difference because i didn 't have any patients anymore so with the advice of my physician i had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital and my colleagues who had known me since medical school in that place said don 't worry chap six weeks you 're back in the operating room everything 's going to be great well you know what bovine stercus is that proved to be a lot of bovine stercus i know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that but it wasn 't that simple because by the time i got out of was not functional at all i could hardly see five feet in front of myself and it was clear not to me because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore that i would need long term hospitalization in that to the institute of living which used to be called the hartford retreat it was founded in the eighteenth century the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of connecticut other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time and they tried everything they had they tried the usual psychotherapy they tried every medication available in those days and they did have tofranil and because i was well known in connecticut they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff all the senior staff got together and i later their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world who by that time had become so overwhelmed not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy but with obsessional thinking obsessional thinking about coincidences and there were particular numbers that every time i saw them just got me dreadfully upset and it got so there was a throbbing there was a ferocious fear in my head you 've seen this painting by edvard munch the scream which actually had been pioneered at the hartford hospital know this again i found this out later that the only thing that could be done was for this as in all hospitals there was a and he asked to meet with the senior staff and they agreed to meet with him because he was very well thought of in that place they thought he and you know of course what 'll happen if you do a pre frontal lobotomy any of the results along the spectrum from pretty bad to terrible terrible terrible is going to happen if he does the best he can he will have no further obsessions probably no depression but his affect will be dulled he will never go back to surgery he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children his life will be changed if he has the usual result he will end up like ' one flew over the cuckoo 's nest ' and you know about that just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life he said can 't we try a course of electroshock therapy and you know why they agreed they agreed to humor him and so we 'll lose a little time big deal it doesn 't so they gave the course of ten and the first the usual course incidentally was six to eight and still is six to eight plugged me into the wires put me to sleep gave me the muscle relaxant six didn 't work seven didn 't work eight didn 't work at nine i noticed and it 's wonderful that i could notice anything of them thought this would do any good they thought this was a temporary change but lo and behold by sixteen and by twenty i had the sense i really had the sense and i 've never forgotten i never will forget it was a sunday morning in january of standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking i 've got the strength now to do but i need a formula i need some thing to say to myself when i begin thinking obsessionally obsessively well the gilbert and sullivan fans in this room will remember ruddigore and they will remember mad and the word my dear will be ' basingstoke ' so every time she got a little nuts he would say it was ah fuck it much better than basingstoke at least for me once more after twenty i was discharged from that hospital and i joined a group of surgeons where i could work with other people in the community not in new haven but fairly close by i stayed there for three years at the end of three years i went back to new haven had remarried by that time my children came back even better than it had been before went right back into the university but it 's been very exciting it 's been very happy every once in a while i have to say why those of you who know some of these books know that one is about death and dying one is about the human body and the human spirit one is about the way mystical thoughts and they have always to do with my own personal experiences one might think reading these books by people who do think this that based on my life 's 's history as i 've portrayed in the books my early life 's history i am someone who has overcome adversity that i am someone who has drunk drank drunk of the bitter dregs of i really have it figured out so that i can can advise people about death and dying so that i can talk about mysticism and i 've always felt guilty about that it 's known by some people in new haven obviously but it is not generally known so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to frankly unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books but more importantly i think and there are many of course who are well over thirty and it looks to me like almost all of you are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career or right into a magnificent and exciting career accidents happen something from childhood comes back to haunt you you can be thrown off the track i hope it happens to none of you it will probably happen to a small percentage of you to those to whom it doesn 't happen there will be adversities that i had in the as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought if i can believe me anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives but who have lived through difficult times perhaps where they lost everything as i did and started out all over again some of these things will seem very familiar there is there is and there is resurrection but it actually and it happens a lot"
