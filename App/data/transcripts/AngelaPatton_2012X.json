  "transcript": "i was sitting with my girls and joy said dang he calls me all the time lucky for you he calls at all i knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers non profit organization we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of african descent prepare for their passage into womanhood these girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives so i asked the girls how can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers and what their fathers could and could not wear it was off and running before i could even blink my eyes but even if i could have slowed down those wouldn 't have because one thing that i have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need the wisdom lives inside of them they can build what they need not only to so we had a dance they acted sweet they really enjoyed each other 's company it was a huge success and the girls decided to make it an annual event and she said and this whole thing can he just get out for a day one of the girls asked and come in shackles that 's worse than not having him here at all at this moment i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion so i asked what do you think we should do about this right and one girl suggested why don 't we just take the dance in the jail to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in spongebob suits because that 's what they called them signed collectively by each girl he contacted me immediately whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside sixteen inmates and eighteen girls were invited the girls were dressed in their sunday best and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties they laughed together it was beautiful the fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection something that a lot of them didn 't even have for a while fathers were in a space where they were and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a but after the dance we all realized that so we brought in flip cams and we had them look at the flip cams and just interview each other messages their thoughts this was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected they could reconnect through this image i 'll never forget that one girl looked in her father 's eyes with that camera and said daddy when you look at me what do you see because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on and how they see us for the rest of our lives i know that was one of the lucky girls i have had my father in my life always he 's even here today and that is why it is extremely special special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors we have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions and given the fathers the freedom to answer because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought what type of woman because a father is locked in not mean he should be locked out of his daughter 's life"
