  "transcript": "i 'm an underwater explorer more specifically a cave diver i wanted to be an astronaut when i was a little kid but growing up in canada as a young girl that wasn 't really available to me as it turns out we know a lot more about space so i decided to do something that was even more remarkable instead of exploring outer space i wanted to explore the wonders of inner sometimes swimming following a thin guideline that 's my workplace and my voice is the one that 's going to teach you about the inside of mother earth there was no guidebook available to me when i decided to be the first person to cave dive inside antarctic icebergs and we went down there to explore ice edge ecology and search for life forms beneath the ice it 's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks and we can make missions even up to twenty hours long underwater i work with biologists it turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life forms species that we never knew existed before and these animals are also extremely so imagine that these are like little swimming dinosaurs what can they teach us about evolution and survival yet the animals are ancient how did they get there and they 're interested oftentimes in global climate change they can take rocks within the caves and they can count back in history and learn about the climate on our planet at very different times so it 's been picked up by wind blown across the atlantic and we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years are also interested in where the sea level stands were at other times on earth here in bermuda my team and i and we were looking for places where the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline many hundreds of feet below current levels and even in when i was a part of the team that made the very first accurate three dimensional map of a subterranean surface three dimensional model as we drove it we also used ultra low frequency radio to broadcast back to the surface our exact position within the cave and what that taught me was that everything we do on the surface of our earth will be returned to us to drink our water planet is not just rivers and when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater and all of our water resources on this planet then we 'll be working on the problem that 's probably the most important issue of this artificially intelligent and its ultimate goal is to go to jupiter 's moon europa and explore oceans beneath the frozen surface of that and that 's pretty amazing"
