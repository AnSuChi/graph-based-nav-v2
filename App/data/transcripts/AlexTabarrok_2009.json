  "transcript": "the first half of the 20th century was an absolute disaster in human affairs a cataclysm we had the first world war the great and they threw up walls communication walls iron curtains it was only in the second half of the 20th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss coming down to less than five percent we globalized the world and what does that mean it means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries transportation walls came tumbling down you know in one thousand nine hundred and fifty the typical ship carried five thousand to ten thousand tons worth of goods communication walls i don 't have to tell you the internet have come tumbling down and of course the iron curtains political walls trade has increased here is just a little bit of data and perhaps most remarkably really for the first time in modern history so china i 've already mentioned beginning around one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight around the time of the death of mao growth ten percent a year year after year after year absolutely in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in china china is the world 's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades and over the next eighteen years have almost tripled growth of six percent a year sub saharan africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth and we can see the tragedy of africa in the first few bars here growth was negative people were actually getting poorer and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been now why on the cutting edge today it 's new ideas which are driving growth and by that i mean it 's products for which the research and development costs are really high and the manufacturing costs are low more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge now ideas have this amazing property thomas jefferson i think really expressed this quite well he said he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine as he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me or to put it but what is new is that the greater function of ideas even more than ever this provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important more powerful than ever before and are going to increase growth more than ever before if you had to choose which would you rather have the common disease or the rare disease common the common i think the reason for this is incentives it costs about the same to produce a new drug but the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people to put this differently larger markets save lives now the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now now we are not there yet but it is happening whether it 's a new design for the hollywood people in the audience this even explains why movies have larger budgets than comedies it how do we maximize that incentive it 's by having one world market globalizing the world the way i like to put this is well how else well more idea creators now idea creators they come from all walks of life artists and innovators many of the people you 've seen on this stage i 'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because i have some data on that and i 'm a data person now today less than one tenth of one percent of the world 's population are scientists and it is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the united states and a handful of other developed countries have shouldered the entire burden of research and development if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the united states is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone which are shared by everyone how many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields the real tragedy of the last century is this if you think about the world the world 's population as a giant computer here is just some data this is china now think what this means this means we all benefit when another country gets rich we should not fear other countries becoming wealthy that is something that we should embrace a wealthy china a wealthy india a wealthy africa we need a greater demand for ideas those larger markets i was talking about earlier and a greater supply now you can see some of the reasons why i 'm optimistic globalization is increasing the demand for ideas the incentive to create new ideas investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas in fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism from about the beginnings of humanity to economic growth nothing one thousand five hundred to one thousand eight hundred maybe a little bit of economic growth but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today twenty first century could easily be three point three even higher percent even at that rate by two thousand one hundred average gdp per capita in the world will be $ two hundred thousand gdp per capita which will be over a million but world gdp per capita $ two hundred thousand that 's not that far and i should say i think this is a rather modest prediction in kurzweilian terms this is gloomy terms i 'm like the eeyore of economic growth here is gdp per capita from one thousand nine hundred to one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine now let 's imagine that you were an economist in future growth for the united states not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century what would you have predicted not knowing this if you had based your prediction your forecast on one thousand nine hundred to one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine you 'd have predicted something like this if you 'd been a little more optimistic say based upon the roaring twenties you 'd have said this so what actually happened we went off a cliff but we recovered so growth can wash away alright what else oil oil this was a big topic when i was writing up my notes oil was $ one hundred and forty per barrel so people were asking a question they were saying is china drinking our milkshake and there is some truth in the sense that as everyone knows look it 's energy not oil which counts and higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy r the world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today than ever in the past because of what i 'm talking about one idea one market the united states has"
