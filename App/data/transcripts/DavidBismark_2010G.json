  "transcript": "few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does we stand in elections we vote in elections we observe elections our democracies rely on and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote we cherish the opportunity to have our say to help decide the future of the country the fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us well unfortunately power corrupts and so people will do lots of things including doing bad things to elections even if the idea of the election is perfect whenever there is an election it seems like something always goes wrong tries to cheat or something goes accidentally awry chads are left hanging over here to make sure as few things as possible go wrong we have all these procedures around the election so for example you come to the polling station and a poll station worker asks for your id before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a well what i want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that after you drop your vote into the ballot box and most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted because they trust that the they trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly they 're unsealed and the votes are poured out and we all have to trust that that happens correctly so so imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong they 've zoomed and the big picture is this elections should be verifiable and that 's the tough part how do we make an election system completely verifiable keeping the votes absolutely secret well the way we 've come up with uses computers but doesn 't depend on them and the secret is the ballot form and that means if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list i won 't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for and on each ballot form there is this and there 's some complicated cryptography going on in there so we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us and then we 'll use the paper for verification so this is how you vote you get one of these ballot forms and the bit that remains the one with your marks this is your encrypted vote so you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote and because it 's encrypted it can be submitted stored and counted centrally including you so and after the close of the election you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website they will not be able to they won 't be able to no hacker can break in and find out how you voted no hacker can break in and change your vote because then it won 't match your receipt votes can 't go missing because then you won 't find yours when you look for it instead we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to so the next step for our democracies thank you"
