  "transcript": "we are at war but it 's sort of been packaged for the one of the big things about countering terrorism is because perception leads to your response to it so if you have a traditional perception of terrorism it would be that it 's one of criminality one of war so you going to respond to it naturally it would follow that you meet kind with kind you fight it and your perception of terrorism is almost cause and effect then naturally from that the responses that come out of it are much more asymmetrical it 's something we have to too and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses google tinted glasses or whatever for my part what i wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand say coca cola both are fairly bad for your health if you look at it 's a pretty flawed product as we 've said it 's pretty bad for your health it 's bad for those who it affects and it 's not actually good if you 're a suicide bomber either it doesn 't actually do what it says on the tin you 're not really going to get seventy two virgins in heaven it 's not going to happen i don 't think but it needs consumers to buy into it the consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency they 're the people who buy into the brand support them facilitate them and they 're the people we 've got to reach out to there 's two essential ways of doing that if we carry on this brand theme one is reducing their market what i mean is it 's their brand against our brand if i 'm trying to show we 're a better product we 've talked there about curtailing the underlying need for the product itself you could be looking there at poverty injustice perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across it 's not just the producers of terrorism as i 've said the and we have to get our messaging in there so the essentials are we 've got to have interaction in those areas with the terrorists the facilitators etc now staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society we 've got to show our values anything we say about coca cola anyone 's going to believe us and one of the best mechanisms i 've ever come across is they are somebody who can actually stand there and say this product 's crap you trust them ngos or even the queen yesterday in northern ireland we have to interact and engage with those different layers of terrorism and in effect we do have to have a little dance with the devil this is my favorite part of my speech i wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point but for health and safety reasons have told me i 've got to do a countdown so i feel like a bit of an irish or jewish terrorist sort of a health and safety terrorist and i i 've got to count three two one and so thinking of what my motto would be and it would be body parts not heart attacks there 's six hundred and twenty five of us in this room we 're going to be scarred for life there was the father will probably kick himself for years to come that he didn 't take that seat instead of his kid he 's going to take to alcohol and he 's probably going to kill himself in three years that 's the stats there 's a and she has something which i think 's the worst form of psychological physical injury i 've ever seen out of and that is a hard thing for 's a lady over there as well who lost her legs in this she 's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount of money off our government for looking after what 's happened to her she had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best universities she 's going to give up university to and all of those but all of you here who are victims are going to learn and we do not enable them and what i 'm going to try and show is that actually victims are the best weapon we have how would the government at the turn of the millennium approach today well we all know what they 'd have done then is an invasion if the suicide bomber was from wales good luck to wales i 'd say knee jerk legislation emergency provision legislation which hits at the very basis of our society as we all know it 's a mistake we 're going to drive prejudice throughout edinburgh throughout the u k for welsh people they are looking at what i 've started off on on these more asymmetrical more modernist views the fear and the pressure to do we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war they 'll see it as freedom fighters and truth against we do have to see this as a deadly battlefield and that 's why the brand analogy if we look at al qaeda was essentially a it was its big marketing day and it was packaged for the 21st century they knew what they were doing they were effectively [ doing ] something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world where there 's poverty ignorance and injustice we as i 've said have got to looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots but one of the first early cases on this was the omagh bombing a civil action was brought from one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight in omagh bomb went off real ira middle of a peace process that meant that the culprits couldn 't really be prosecuted mostly to do with the peace process and what was going on the greater good it also meant then if you can imagine this that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in some of those victims said enough is enough we brought a private action there is a slight appeal on at the moment so i have to be a bit careful but i 'm it was because the real ira and other terrorist groups their whole strength is from the fact that they are an underdog when we put the victims as the underdog and flipped it they were embarrassed their recruitment went down the bombs actually stopped fact because of this action there 's other examples we have a case called almog which is to do with bank giving rewards to suicide bombers just by bringing the very action couldn 't actually deal with this issue because there was lots of competing interests have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system 's another case called the mcdonald case where some victims of semtex of the provisional ira bombings and that action has led to amazing things for new libya libya new libya has been compassionate towards those victims and started taking it so it started a whole new dialogue there but the problem is we need more and more support for these ideas and cases civil affairs and you 're wrong what we 're trying to do is turn pirates to fisherman they used to be fisherman of course but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste in their water al shabaab and such likes will not have the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people the last one i wanted to talk about was dialogue the advantages of dialogue are obvious it self educates both sides the shared vulnerability does lead to trust but it 's not an easy road after it 's politically risky for the protagonists and when i did a point they liked equally not great now i just want to end if we follow reason we realize that i think we 'd all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it the private sector has a role the role we could do right now is going away and looking at how if i was to leave you with some big questions here which may change one 's perception to it and who knows what thoughts and responses will come out of it we have to ask ourselves these questions however unpalatable have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world what if actually engagement on poverty and injustice is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do what if the bombs are just simply wake up calls for us what happens if that bomb went off because we didn 't have any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction and i just want to leave you with one idea which is that it 's a provocative question for you to think about and the answer will require sympathy with the devil what if society actually needs what if society actually needs terrorism it 's that picture of jesus and the devil hand in hand in gethsemane walking into the moonlight what it would mean is that humans quite darwinian spirit here inherently must dance with the devil"
