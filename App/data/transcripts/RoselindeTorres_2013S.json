  "transcript": "what makes a great leader today many of us carry this image of this all knowing superhero who stands and commands and protects his followers and what 's also outdated are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was not a world that is we conducted a study of four thousand let 's see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs fifty eight percent of the companies cited significant talent gaps for critical leadership roles that means that despite corporate training programs assessments coaching all of these things more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders you may be asking yourself the odds are probably not i 've spent twenty five years of my professional life i 've worked inside fortune five hundred companies i noticed that despite all the efforts there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals one story was and then there were stories but only one of the top fifty leaders is equipped to lead their crucial and then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a once thriving business finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half or go out of business now these recurring stories why are the leadership gaps widening when there 's so much more investment in leadership development and what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow i was so consumed by these questions and also frustrated by those stories that i left my job so that i could study and i took a year to travel to different parts of the world countries and nonprofit organizations where i had an opportunity to understand how nelson mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political social and economic context i also met a number of nonprofit leaders who despite very limited financial resources were making a huge impact in the world and i spent countless hours and then the impact of those moves beyond their and then when i returned to work full time now from all this i distilled the characteristics of leaders who are thriving and what they do differently and then i also distilled the preparation practices that enable people to grow to their potential i want to share some of those with you now what digitally enabled and transparent with faster speeds of information flow and innovation and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix development practices will stunt your growth as a leader in fact lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are leadership in is defined and evidenced by three questions where are you looking to anticipate the next change to your business model or your life the answer to this question is on your calendar who are you spending time with on what topics and then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities there 's a leadership team that does a practice here are trends that impact me here are trends that impact another team member and then make decisions to course correct a strategy or to anticipate a new move great leaders are not shaping their future not just reacting to it the second question is what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network you know we hear often about good ol ' boy they 're certainly alive and well in many institutions but to some extent we all have a network of people that we 're comfortable with so this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you and yet despite all these differences they connect with you and they trust you enough to cooperate with you in achieving a shared goal great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions because you have people that are thinking differently than you are third question are you courageous enough to abandon a practice that has made you successful in the past chances are as a leader you 're going to keep doing what 's familiar and comfortable great leaders dare to be different they don 't just talk about risk taking they actually do it and one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is nave or reckless or just plain stupid now interestingly the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network they 're often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you not a step answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a 21st century leader so what makes a great leader in the i 've met many and they stand out they are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday but also for the realities of today thank you"
