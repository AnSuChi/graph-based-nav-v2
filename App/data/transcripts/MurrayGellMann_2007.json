  "transcript": "thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here we 'll be talking about them now i 'm going try an experiment i don 't do experiments normally i 'm a theorist but i 'm going see what happens if i press this button i used to work in this field of elementary particles what happens to matter if you chop it up very fine what is it made of and the laws of these particles we know a lot about four forces there must be a lot more but those are at very very small distances and we haven 't really interacted with them very much yet the main thing i want to talk about is this that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory and why on earth could that be so here 's an example from my own experience it 's fairly dramatic actually to have this happen three or four of us in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces this weak force and it was in disagreement with seven seven count them seven experiments experiments were the experiments had to be wrong and they were used to pay very little attention when people said you know there 's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity dc miller what about that and he why does stuff like that work that 's the question now yeah what do we mean by beautiful that 's one thing i 'll try to make that clear partially clear why should it work and is this something to do with human beings i 'll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer orbiting some very distant star maybe in a another galaxy there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are and are interested in science it 's not impossible i think there probably are lots very likely none is close enough to interact with us but they could be out there very you know very different sensory apparatus and so on they have seven tentacles and they have fourteen little funny looking compound eyes and a brain shaped like a pretzel i think there are laws out there and someday we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces we can still think there is one out there and we 're just trying to get closer and closer to it i think that 's the main point to and when the mathematics is very simple without a lot of complication that 's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance a unified theory underlying all the because and i won 't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it 's like and so on you 've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway there are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff but the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities now sometimes those probabilities are near certainties and in a lot of familiar cases they of course are but other times they 're not and it 's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents or there in addition and the fundamental theory doesn 't include those chance outcomes they are in addition it 's often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental and we keep doing that and build more powerful machines accelerators we look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law now what happens we see that each skin we write them out mathematically and we see they use very similar mathematics they require very similar mathematics that is absolutely remarkable and that is a central feature of what i 'm trying to say today newton called it that 's newton by the way that one this one is albert einstein and so what happens is that the new phenomena the new skins the inner skins of the the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to resemble the slightly larger ones and the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin skin and that 's why the equations look so simple because they use mathematics we already have a trivial example is this newton found the law of gravity which goes like one over the square of the distance between in france found the same law for electric charges here 's an example of this similarity sure enough the same rule you know what it means a circle for example is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle they are symmetries of the sphere so we say in general that there 's a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon or its description unchanged maxwell 's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space doesn 't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle it doesn 't leave the doesn 't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism there 's a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this and if you use that notation the equations get a lot simpler looked at a whole set of symmetries of maxwell 's equations which are called special relativity and those symmetries then make the equations even shorter and even prettier therefore let 's look you don 't have to know what these things mean doesn 't make any difference but you can just look at the form x y and z then using vector analysis you use rotational symmetry and you get this next set then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set the last two the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields the next second equation says that there is no magnetism other than that the only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents someday we may find some slight hole in that argument but for the moment that 's the case but it 's a little to explain in technical detail so i won 't do they hoped that this would contribute somehow and then it did and it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force so here we say again what we said before that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins so the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one and therefore it looks beautiful we believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities unification exhibit the simplicity symmetry exhibits the simplicity and then there proximate self similarity that will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory here 's what newton himself said is very consonant and conformable to her self but in his day it wasn 't taken for granted there 's the story which is not absolutely certain to be right but a lot of people told it four sources told it that when they had the plague in cambridge and he went down to his mother 's farm because the university was closed he saw an apple fall from a tree or on his head or something and he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon so he said that this principle of nature nature consonance lest i should be accounted an extravagant freak that 's what we all have to watch out for especially at this meeting and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind everybody knows that it 's a property of gravitation it 's not something in the human mind the human mind can of course appreciate it and enjoy it and that 's true of all the things we 're talking about they are properties of the fundamental law the fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin i say here that newton did a lot of things that year gravity the laws of motion the calculus white and he could have written quite an essay on what i did over my summer vacation laughter so we don 't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates they follow from the fundamental they are what we call emergent properties you don 't need you don 't need something more to get something more that 's what emergence means the human mind can you don 't need something more to get something more"
