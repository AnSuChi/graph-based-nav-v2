  "transcript": "which is at the same time and yet much much closer much more directly related to us there are many things we don 't really understand and one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us and today i want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity what is complex well all different and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery on the opposite and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior complex systems have many interacting parts which behave according to simple individual rules the behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only but the system is disorganized milk every individual starts pushing in one direction the pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction so it 's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges i call this simplifying complexity and it 's what we do at the chair of systems design at eth zurich it requires physicists who work with biologists with mathematicians and computer in a way and you may be asking yourself which side i 'm on biology it 's a little different and to explain i need to tell you a short story about myself so i set out to study electrical engineering and robotics and my my end of studies project was about building a robot called er 1 it looked like this that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground and on demo day professors had assembled to grade the project so we took er 1 to the evaluation room it and crashed into a wall we had spent weeks building it and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room i wanted to understand complexity the complexity of the world around us and especially in the animal kingdom which brings us to bats and they stay together for about six months to rear their young we know where she is and more importantly we know with whom she is it could be that on one day so what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony associations between individuals out this is a very interesting picture and all the communities stay the same so these bats remember their friends for a really long time we didn 't know that was possible we knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that but compared to bats they have huge brains so and this is where complexity brings an answer to understand this system and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony it 's a mathematical model but it 's not complicated what the model told us is that in a nutshell each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them but it gets better between two thousand and ten and two thousand and eleven the colony lost more than two thirds of its members probably due to the very cold winter which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small instead it formed a single cohesive social unit which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years and from this simplicity emerges social complexity and i find this incredible to tell you another story but for this we have to travel from europe to the kalahari desert in south africa this is where meerkats live i 'm sure you know meerkats they 're fascinating creatures they live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy there is one dominant pair and many subordinates some acting as sentinels some acting as babysitters some teaching pups and so on what we do is put very small gps collars on these animals how they move together and what this has to do with their social structure and there 's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats but the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to so we asked how exactly do they do this but when it comes to crossing it crossing the road she gives way to the subordinates a manner of saying go ahead tell me if it 's safe what i didn 't know in fact was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen and if simple rules were sufficient so i built a model and they bounce against it the only difference and this tiny difference in the individual 's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe that the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first but some models are useful this model because in reality meerkats are anything but random particles but it 's also useful because it tells us that extreme at the individual level when the dominant female the whole group is at risk behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response these meerkats and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash or it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road or it may be another species my message here and it 's not a complicated one but a simple one of wonder and hope my message here is that and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment in simplicity thank you"
