  "transcript": "this is my salman schocken who was born and when he was fourteen years old he never went back to school salman was the consummate perfectionist and every one of his stores and like everything else he did it in grand style he surrounded himself with an entourage and yet together with his family leaving everything else behind he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture this high school dropout died at the age of eighty two a formidable intellectual cofounder and first ceo of the hebrew university of jerusalem and founder of schocken books an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by random house such is the power of self study and these are my parents they were too busy building a family and a country records and artwork i remember quite vividly my father telling me that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a tv set then we 'll buy a normal f m radio and that 's me i was going to say holding my first abacus but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an ipad so one thing that i took from home is this notion instead they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own so i 'd like to share with you a story about a and over the years and indeed it is impossible to connect with soul of the machine so noam and i had this insight that if we want our students to understand how computers work and understand it in the marrow of their bones then perhaps the best way to go about it is useful computer hardware and software from the ground up from first principles and so noam and i so to speak on the simplest possible building block which is something called nand so we now start this journey by telling our students that god gave us nand and told us to build a computer and when we asked how god said one step at a time humble nand gate and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence of projects in which they gradually build set a hardware platform an assembler a virtual machine a basic operating system and a compiler for a simple java like language that we call jack the students celebrate the end of this tour de force by using jack to write all sorts of cool games and tetris you can imagine the tremendous joy of playing with a tetris game that you wrote in jack and then compiled into machine language in a compiler that you wrote also and then seeing the result running on a machine that you built starting with nothing more than a few thousand nand gates it 's a tremendous personal triumph of going from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex and useful system noam and i worked five years and this is the great team that helped us make it happen the trick was to decompose the computer 's construction so chip specifications lectures and do whatever they want with it and then and in short order thousands of people one of the first although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called moocs we just observed how self organized courses were kind of spontaneously spawning pramode c e an engineer from kerala india has organized groups of self learners who build our computer another engineer from mumbai has unbundled our projects into smaller more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do it yourself computer science program the people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality they want to figure yu fangmin from guangzhou has used fpga technology to build our computer and show others how to do the same using a video clip and craddock developed a very nice computer game which is quite a complex 3d maze that ben developed using the minecraft 3d simulator engine and ben became an if you will has turned into a life changing experience michigan a few weeks ago dan posted a victorious post on our website and i 'd like to read it to you so here 's what i did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me just like literacy and numeracy but given what i now feel capable of doing i would certainly do it again but you 'll be profoundly changed and it 's quite amazing because these people they are doing it because of one motivation only they have a tremendous and with that in mind i 'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading i 'm sick of it according is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm and so we collect your b pluses and your a minuses which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are well in my opinion we went too far with this and share with you a glimpse from my current project which is different from the previous one but it shares exactly the same characteristics of and we do it on tablets because we believe that math like anything else should be taught hands on so for example let 's take area when you deal with a concept like area so if area is what interests us then one thing which is natural to do is to tile the area of this particular shape and simply count how many tiles and this little exercise here gives you a first well if you try to tile it it and at some point you will you can rearrange the parts you can glue them and then proceed to tile just like we did before now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure so a six year old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram so after some guided trial and error the child will discover with or without help transpose it glue it to the original and then proceed [ with ] what we did before cut rearrange paste oops paste and glue and tile now this transformation has doubled the area of the self exploration so in addition to learning some useful geometry the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated science strategies which is the the art of transforming a complex problem into a simple one or generalization which is at the heart of any scientific discipline or the fact that some properties are invariant under some transformations and all this is something that a very young child can pick up using such mobile we 've developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author any parent or actually anyone interest in math education can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps and finally we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem that will match different learners with different apps according to their evolving learning style"
