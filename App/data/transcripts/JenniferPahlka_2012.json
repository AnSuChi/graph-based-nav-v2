  "transcript": "years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off we have them work in government we select a few fellows every year and so meet al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston but what he 's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in because he knows he 's not very good at fighting fires when he 's covered we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program they were there in february and it snowed a lot in february last year and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants so he did what any good developer would do he wrote an app it so you agree to dig it out when it snows if you do you get to name it and he called the first one al and if you don 't someone can steal it from you so it 's got cute little game dynamics on it there 's a guy in the i t department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it not for it 's very important that these tsunami sirens work but people steal the batteries out of them so he 's getting citizens to check on them and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it naturally we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months it was a way that we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels it would have taken at least two years and there are projects like this at every level so an app that takes it suggests how government could work better it means app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government now there 's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively it 's not just code for america fellows there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps and that 's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we 're really mad about government is at its core in the words of tim o 'reilly what we do together that we can 't do alone because things are changing and because government ultimately derives its power from us and like a lot of people i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office well after two years come to the conclusion that especially local government is about opossums this is the call center for the services and information line it 's generally where you will get if you call three hundred and eleven in your city if you should ever have the chance to staff your city 's call center as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program in fact they all do that you will find that people call government with a very wide range of so scott gets this call he types opossum into this official knowledge base he doesn 't really come up with anything he starts with animal control and finally he says look can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves boston doesn 't just have a call center it has an app a web and mobile app called citizens connect so one day this is an actual report this came in opossum in my trashcan can 't tell if it 's dead how do i get this removed but on citizens connect everything is public so everybody can see this and in this case a neighbor saw it and the next report we got said goodnight sweet opossum so this is great this is the digital meeting the physical but it 's also a great example of government as a platform so one citizen helped another citizen but government played a key role here it connected those two people but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it 's not the now how many times have we elected a political leader and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected and then not that much changes that 's because government is like a vast ocean and what 's under that is what we call bureaucracy but it 's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that 's working against us this other thing and then we 're disempowering ourselves so that 's it 's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed it 's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children you have to see the enormous challenges that they 're going to face do we really think we 're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us we can 't do without government but we do need it to be more effective the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale and there 's a generation out there that 's grown up on the begrudgingly almost a generation older than most of them this is a generation that 's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted and they do they don 't care as much about using their voices they 're using their hands to write applications that make government work better and those applications let us use our hands turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it and certainly we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along and many people do but these apps are like little digital reminders that we 're not just consumers and we 're not just consumers of government putting in our taxes and getting back services we 're more than that we 're citizens and we 're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship so the question i have for all of you here when it comes to the big important things that we need to do together all of us thank you"
