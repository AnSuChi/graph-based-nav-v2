  "transcript": "we discussed a number of titles with the organizers and a lot of different items were kicked around and were discussed but nobody suggested this one and the reason for that was two months ago was escalating exponentially and spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen but today i can stand here and i can talk to you about beating ebola because of people whom you 've never heard of people like peter clement the reason that lofa county is so important when the epidemic was just starting to escalate lofa county was right at the center the epicenter of this epidemic and these patients these communities were becoming more and to their children to their relatives road from monrovia the capital up to lofa county to try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there and what peter found when he arrived and what he heard was heartbreaking he heard about the devastation but what it did to families and what it did to communities and he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him they said when they were deeply disturbed deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic was unraveling in front of them people were turning on the healthcare workers who had come the heroes who had come to try and help save and peter explained what ebola was he explained what the disease was he explained what it did to their communities and he explained that ebola threatened everything that made us human means you can 't hold your children the way you would in this situation you can 't bury your dead the way that you would you have to trust these people in these space suits to do that for you the community and the health workers peter they sat down together and they put together a new plan for controlling ebola in lofa county and the reason that this is such an is because today which is right at the center of this epidemic you 've been watching you 've been seeing in the newspapers you 've been seeing on the television screens today lofa county is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of ebola but what it does teach us is that ebola can be beaten that 's the key thing even with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here we now know ebola but how did ebola end up in lofa county in the first place and as many of you know this virus went undetected it evaded detection for three or four months when it began that 's because this is not a disease of west africa it 's a disease of central africa half a continent away people hadn 't seen the disease before health workers hadn 't seen the disease before they didn 't know what they were dealing with and to make it even more complicated the virus itself was causing people who knew ebola once the virus was detected there was a rapid surge in of support msf rapidly set up an ebola treatment center as many of you know in the area the world health organization and the partners that it works with deployed eventually hundreds of people over the next two months to be able to help had spread too far it had already outstripped what was one of the largest responses that had been mounted so far to an ebola outbreak the numbers were increasing the front line responders the people who had gone to try and help the presidents of these countries recognized the emergencies they met right they agreed on common action and they put together an emergency joint operation center in conakry to try and work together to finish this disease and get it stopped this time it was in nigeria in the teeming metropolis of lagos twenty one million people there was international alarm international concern on a scale that we hadn 't seen in recent years caused by a disease like the world health organization immediately called together an expert panel looked at the situation declared an international emergency and in doing so the expectation and very soon these countries found themselves not receiving the support they needed but increasingly isolated but also for the response in that situation ladies and gentleman a virus like ebola takes not only did this virus continue in the places where they 'd already become infected but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here something we 'd never seen before on such a scale an exponential increase of ebola cases not just in these countries ladies and gentleman this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we 've ever seen markets no longer started no longer functioned which became even more alarmed about around the world many people began to ask can we ever stop ebola when it starts to spread like this and they started to ask how well do we really know this virus the reality is we don 't know ebola extremely well it 's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it we 've known the disease only for forty years since it first popped up in central africa we know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat we know that it probably enters a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal that has been infected with the virus and probably sickened by it then we know that the virus and as you 've all seen we know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans where we see this in seventy percent of the cases or often more death they 've got to understand how it spreads and how to stop it but at the same time it was stopped in senegal where it had spread was whether these strategies could work on this scale in this situation with so many countries affected with the kind of of local leaders of u n agencies and engagement the case finding contact tracing etc and they turned them on their head there was so much disease they approached it differently what they decided to do was they would first try and slow down this epidemic by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers so that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected they would rapidly build out many many burial teams so that they could safely deal with the dead and with that they would try and slow this outbreak we saw militaries from within those countries and from far beyond coming in to help build ebola treatment centers that could be used to isolate those who were sick we saw the red cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there to help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead in a dignified manner themselves and we saw the u n agencies the world food program build a tremendous air bridge that could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly to be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about what we saw ladies and gentlemen which was probably most impressive was this incredible work by the governments by the leaders in these countries what we saw was what you see now in this graph when we took stock on and for this reason on a minute that 's great you can slow it down but can you actually drive it down to zero we already answered that question back at the beginning of this talk when i spoke about lofa county in we told you the story how lofa county got to a situation where they have not seen ebola for eight weeks but there are similar stories the first area where the first case was actually diagnosed we 've seen very very few cases in the last couple of months we have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks way too early to declare victory but this disease can be is doing this on the scale needed right across these three countries and that is a huge challenge two other big threats come in to join the virus the first of those is complacency complacency always a risk and the other risk of course is when you 've been working so hard for so long and slept so few hours and these new risks start to creep into the response ladies and gentlemen i can tell you today i 've just come back from west africa they want to drive ebola to zero in their countries and these people yes to stand with them to get the job finished because finishing ebola right now means turning the tables on this virus and beginning to hunt it but it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists enough health workers enough logisticians and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one of those cases track their contacts and make sure that this disease stops once and for all now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen and educate on what it means to beat ebola and more importantly we need you to advocate with the people who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries to beat this in part because of what you do to help us beat ebola"
