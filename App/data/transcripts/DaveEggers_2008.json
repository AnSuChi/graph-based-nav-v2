  "transcript": "thank you so much everyone from ted and chris and amy in particular i cannot believe i 'm here i have not slept in weeks neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we 've slept in anticipation for this i 've never been so nervous and i do this when i 'm nervous i just realized so i was i was trying to finish my first book i was wandering around dazed every day because i wrote from but i had flexible hours in the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope there are a lot of writers it 's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to meanwhile i had grown up around a lot my mom was a teacher my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching and so i was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were and they were really sort of the most hard working and constantly inspiring people i knew but i knew so many of the things they were up against so many of the the struggles they were dealing with and one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level where a lot of them have different special needs learning disabilities and of course they 're working in schools which sometimes and very often are under funded and so they would talk to me about this and say you know what we really need is just more people more bodies more one on one attention more hours more expertise from people that have we have five classes of thirty to forty students each this can lead up to one hundred and fifty one hundred and eighty two hundred students how can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one on one attention you 'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers and so we started talking about this and at the same time i thought about this massive group of people i knew writers editors journalists graduate students assistant professors you name it all these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the english word i hope to have an interest in the english language but i 'm not speaking it well right now i 'm trying that clock has got me but everyone that i knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy nurturing an enlightened life and so and their interest but at the same time there wasn 't a conduit that i knew of in my community to bring these two communities together so when i moved back to we rented this building and the idea was to put mcsweeney 's mcsweeney 's quarterly that we published twice or three times a year and a few other magazines we we were going to move it into an office and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center so we thought we why don 't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school get extra help on their written homework so you have basically no border between these two thirty p m the students flow in and you put down what you 're doing or you trade or you work a little bit later or whatever it is you give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood so we rented it the landlord was all for it we did this mural that 's a chris ware mural that basically explains the entire history of the printed word in mural form it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road so we rented this space and everything was was great except the landlord said well the space is zoned for retail you have to come up with something you 've gotta sell something you can 't just have a tutoring center so we thought ha ha really and we couldn 't think of anything necessarily to sell but we we did all the necessary research it used to be a weight room so there were rubber floors below acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights we took all that down we found beautiful wooden floors whitewashed beams and it had the look while we were renovating this place somebody said you know it and we looked around and somebody else said well you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer and so this is what we did so it made everybody laugh and we said there 's a point to that let 's sell pirate supplies we made it look sort of pirate supply like here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy we have the peg legs there that are all handmade and fitted to you up at the top you see the eyepatch display which is the the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night so we we opened this place and this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in this is replacement eyes in case you lose one these are some signs that we have all over the place practical joking with pirates while you 're reading the sign we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head that was just my one thing i said we had to have something that drops on people 's heads which is just a saltwater tank with three seats which was the tutoring center so right there is the tutoring center and then behind the curtain were the mcsweeney 's offices where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that the kids would come in or we thought they would come in i should back up g4s with a stroke of a paddle and we sat and at two thirty p m we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said free tutoring for your it 's all free and we thought oh they 're going to storm the gates they 're gonna love it we sat at the tables we waited and waited and everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited really where nobody came in and then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a a trust gap because we were operating behind a pirate supply store we never put it a woman named nineveh caligari a longtime san francisco educator she was teaching in mexico city was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything and so suddenly it was actually full the goal was to have a one to one ratio with every one of these students you know it 's been proven that thirty five to forty hours a year with one on one attention a student can get one grade level higher and so they come there many times their parents you can 't see and we found ourselves full every day with kids if you 're on valencia street within those few blocks which is very strange because it 's school in a way kids weren 't going into the there 's a publishing company in the back and so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often and so it became a tutoring center they go in and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel because we had very gifted kids too so they can lean over ask a question of one of these adults feeds on each other there 's a lot of cross pollination the only problem especially for the adults 't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up was that there was just the one bathroom working enjoy other hobbies get outside play so the key to it all is homework off with about twelve volunteers and then we had about fifty and then a couple hundred and we now have one thousand four hundred volunteers on our on our roster and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer the key thing is even if you only have a couple of hours concentrated attention shining this beam of light on their work on their because so many of the students have not had that ever before so we said even if you have two hours one sunday every six months it doesn 't matter that 's going to be enough so that 's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast then we said well what are we going to do with the space during the day because it has to be used before two thirty p m so we started bringing in classes during the day so every day there 's a field trip where they together create a book you can see it being typed is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing you just point a camera at a class and it always looks like this so this is one of the books that they do notice the title of the book the book that was never checked out titanic and the first line of that book is once there was a book named cindy taking it completely seriously which this is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events the teachers that we work with and everything is different to teachers they tell us what to do we went completely malleable you 're going to tell us the neighborhood 's going to tell us the parents are going to tell us the teachers are going to tell us how we 're most useful so then they said why don 't you come into the schools because what about the students that wouldn 't come to you necessarily who don 't have really active parents that are bringing them in or aren 't close enough so then we started saying well we 've got one thousand four hundred people on our tutor roster let 's just put out the word a teacher will say i need twelve tutors for straight into the classroom and working directly with the students so then we 're able to work with then another school said if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day so this is the everett middle school and there we serve all five hundred and twenty nine kids in this middle school this is their newspaper the straight up news that has an ongoing column so then i want them to write about how how to achieve peace in a violent world and so we went into thurgood marshall high school which is a school that we had worked with on some other things and we gave that assignment to the students and we said isabel allende is going to read all your essays at the end she 's going to going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form it 's going to be available in all the bookstores in the bay area and throughout the world on amazon and you name it so these kids worked harder than they 've ever worked on anything in their lives because there was that outside audience there was isabel allende on the other end i think we had about one hundred and seventy tutors that worked on this book with them so that led to a series of these you can see amy tan sponsored now that we 've honored their words honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts six drafts all this attention that we give to their thoughts and once they achieve that level once they 've written at that level they can never go back it 's absolutely transformative and so then they 're all sold in the store where else would you put them right so we sell ' em and then something weird had been happening so it was paying the rent but people would come in and this was before the pirate movies and everything it was making a lot of money not a lot of money but it was paying the rent paying a full time staff member there there 's the ocean maps you can see it became a gateway to the community people would come in and say what the what is this i don 't want to swear on the web is that a rule i don 't know they would say what is this and people would come in and and learn more about it and then right beyond there 's usually a little chain there right and they might be more likely to buy some lard or millet for their parrot or you know the 30th floor of some building downtown was right in the neighborhood that it was serving and it was open all the time to the public so it became this sort of weird happy accident so all the people i used to know in brooklyn they said well why don 't we have a place like that here and a lot of them had been former educators or would be educators so they combined with a lot of local designers local writers and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing they didn 't want to sell pirate supplies community in new york they opened the brooklyn superhero supply company this is sam potts ' great design that did this and this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith 's shops that has to have every service they 've ever offered you know all over there so they opened this place inside it 's like a costco for for superheroes these so then you have the villain containment unit where kids put their parents you have the office this is a if you want to buy anything and it limits really their sales some of the products so this is the capery where you get fitted for your and then you walk up these three steel graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans there 's nothing worse than you know getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that so then the secret door this is one of the shelves you don 't see when you walk in but it slowly opens you can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks it opens you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back complete devotion to the students ' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas and this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those eighteen feet of this bizarre store right so it 's school but it 's not school it 's clearly not school even though they 're working shoulder to shoulder on tables came in soon enough he was writing he would finish his homework early got really addicted to finishing his homework early it 's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it and to have it checked and to know he 's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next so he got hooked on that and then he started doing other things he 's now been published in five books he co wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called super has beens he wrote a series on penguin balboa which is a fighting a boxing penguin he 's evangelical about it he brings his cousins in now there 's four family members that come in every day so i 'll go through really quickly this is l a the echo park time travel mart whenever you are we 're already then so you see everything it 's exactly as a 7 eleven would be they i 'm going to jump ahead which inspired us studio st louis austin bat cave in austin fighting words in dublin ireland started by roddy doyle this will be open in april now i 'm going to the ted wish is that okay all right i 've got a minute so that within a year we have a thousand examples a thousand tell us these stories and inspire others on on the i 'm going to switch to we and not i hope we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools we hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community always let the teachers lead the way they will tell you how to be useful i hope that you 'll step in and and it 's called upon a school which is a great title i think this site will document every story every project that comes out of this conference so you go to the website you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started if you have any questions you can ask this guy who 's our director of national programs he 'll be on the phone you email him he 'll answer any question you possibly want and he 'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change"
