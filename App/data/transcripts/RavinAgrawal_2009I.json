  "transcript": "right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art contemporary artists in india are having a conversation with the world like never before i thought it might be interesting even for the many here with us at ted local collectors to have an outside view of ten young indian artists i wish everyone at ted to know the first is bharti kher the central motif of bharti 's practice is the but originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye the spiritual world and the religious world bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche as she calls it by exploding it into something spectacular she also creates life size fiberglass sculptures often of animals which she then completely covers in bindis often with potent symbolism she says she first got started with ten packets what she could do with ten thousand working wonders with fiberglass except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible chitra ganesh is known for her digital collages using indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material learn their religious and mythological folk tales i for one was steeped in these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics and she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well and his home city of mumbai is an he also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot he creates these fine delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale or in his increasingly ambitious installation work here with one hundred and functioning sewing machines fabricating the flags of every member of the united nations mumbai based dhruvi acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern indian women she too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas but in a very different way than chitra ganesh she actually strips out the images but also by the kashmiri textiles of his youth he actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills i 'm kind of cheating with this next artist since raqs media collective are really three artists working together they frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization and their home of delhi is a frequent element in their work they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens in which the city itself may have been the culprit he was first known for creating giant kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every indian and on a grander and grander scale by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations and finally number who lives and works here in the state of karnataka creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial and brings like subodh the local global these are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye and she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space and interact with the objects and light and shadow are a very important part of her work she also explores themes of consumerism but with the strips of steel salvaged from cars that she found in a bangalore junkyard"
