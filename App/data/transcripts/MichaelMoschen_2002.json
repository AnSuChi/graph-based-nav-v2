  "transcript": "i started juggling a long time ago but long before that i was a golfer and that 's what i was a golfer and as a golfer and as a kid one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores that i sort of lived my whole life is process and he had a real passion for golf and he also created this whole mythology about ben hogan and i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time but grew to know know stuff about and that was the mythology of skill so one of the things that i love to do is to explore skill and since richard put me on this whole thing with music but i 'm going to explore skill and ok you can start the music the can be a lot of fun play with skill and play with space play with rhythm and you can turn the mike on now do a couple of pieces i do a big piece in a triangle part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space and controlling the balls with my feet well a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff well i kind of from my childhood and golf and all that it 's a process of joining with forces so juggling gravity up down if you figure out what up and down really are it 's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up but then you add in sideways i look at it somewhat as a way when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes and see with your hands because you 're not looking at your hands you 're looking at where the balls are or you 're looking at the audience so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm but it 's also where the feet were where the balls were and remember you 're transposing you 're getting into a subculture here and juggling the balls cross and all that ok if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines but then hopefully even rhythm and you can change the rhythm good change the rhythm so it 's even or you can go back but you 're boxed in if you can only do it up and down that way so you 've got to go after the space down there because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you and then you get crazy complexity if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions perceptions change it 's learning skills like being in a high speed car crash you may not be able to affect it complexity now how many here are jugglers so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this well that 's what juggling is about right it 's another way so since you all don 't understand what the five ball pattern is i 'm going let me put you in that area of learning which is very insecure what you 're going to learn is this so what i want you to do is just listen to me and do it lot of different learning processes going on in here one learning process that i see is this so what you 're doing is you 're going la so what i want you to do is fingers i 'll tell you what to do with your fingers same thing but i want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow going to start off looking at the white ball and i 'm going to tell you which color and i 'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers reason i wanted you to do this is because that 's actually what most people face a moment of learning a moment of challenge it 's a moment that you can 't make sense of why the hell should i anything to do with anything in my life you know i can 't decipher is it fun is it challenging am i supposed to cheat you know what are you supposed to it 's just a moment i 'm going to change the script for one second just let me do this i don 't need music for it talking about time in a moment there 's a piece that i recently developed but they 're not original techniques well as a juggler what i wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else and it and then it 's dependent on something else and then it comes to rest but i just thought i 'd talk about a moment can we show the video of the triangle are we ready to do that yes this is the piece that i told you about it 's a much bigger piece that i do exploring the space of a geometric triangle ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at one hundred and twenty miles an hour and when i bought my first car it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents ' house so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body to have a conversation with it to speak to listen hup now it 's dependent on rhythm and keeping a center of balance when it falls going a rhythm to it the rhythm can get much smaller as your skill increases you learn to find those tinier spaces those tinier movements thanks now i 'm going to show you the beginnings piece that is about balance if you 're bored not here here 's one use for it the the the which is again exploring space working with space and the lines in space in a different way time but working with one ball now what if you attach something to it or change it this is a little thing that i made because i really like the idea of curves and balls and then creating space which is what have i got here this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape just did was i worked with the mathematics sometimes these pieces are mathematical in that way that i look at a shape and say what about i use this and this and this sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that i try to work with the next piece that i 'm going to do which is the cylinders piece if you want to get that up it has to do with cylinder seals from about five thousand years ago which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents the second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness so if you want to go with the music for cylinders the the the the the the if you take the circle and you split it in half can you run s curve music i 'm going to do just a short version of it circles split in half the kinetic sculpture in the middle of it and i dance around a small stage so two minutes just to end the latest piece that i 'm working on they 're not ideas they 're instincts and the latest thing that i 'm working on something really i like not to know for as long as possible instead of me imposing the truth is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves and what it involves and i don 't know if my hands are and then playing with the sense of space of filling in the space and then it started and become folding on themselves and then changing levels because my attempt is to make visual instruments not to just make i 'll try one other thing for work in three dimensions with your perceptions of space now i don 't know exactly where it 's going but i 've got a bit this may not be the right shape just to see just to play and to change so i 'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space we 'll see what i come"
