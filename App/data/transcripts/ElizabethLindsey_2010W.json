  "transcript": "i was raised by native hawaiian elders the year is we 're watching the rising of the stars the smooth stones on the sand you might dismiss them as poor and simple that would be a mistake trained in the old ways and now they 're passing it on to me they teach me the names of the winds and the rains of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars they begin to chant they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them ' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance you will go far away we will not be there it will take all of you i hold onto all my life because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me i 'm on a remote island in micronesia satawal is one half mile long it 's the home of my mentor his name is pius mau piailug mau is a palu a navigator priest he 's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the pacific without the use of instruments the flight patterns of certain birds even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy when western scientists would join mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull it appeared that an old man was going to rest it is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of gathering explicit data it 's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel the palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance and then he would say okay we go he saw that first glint of light he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms we are in such a critical moment of our collective history they have been compared to astronauts these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island their canoes our rockets their sea our the wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories we cannot afford to lose it just as the women in hawaii that raised me predicted the world is in trouble we 're connected an african shaman said your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes the link between the past and the future is fragile this i know intimately because even as i travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them i struggle i am haunted by the fact that i no longer remember the names of the winds but his legacy and lessons live on sums of knowledge in them as potent as the micronesian navigators that are going dismissed that this is a testament to brilliant brilliant technology and science and wisdom and throughout the world libraries are ablaze i am grateful and i realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way and this is what he said the island if you are voyaging and far from home you cannot make the voyage alone you were never meant to this whole notion of every man for himself is completely always was so in closing i would offer you this the planet true navigation it 's the most important map of all together may we journey well"
