  "transcript": "talking about designing humor which is sort of an interesting thing but it goes to some of the now i 'm from new york so it 's one hundred percent satisfaction actually that 's ridiculous because when it comes to humor seventy five percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for nobody is ever satisfied one hundred percent with humor except this woman that part of the relationship went fine laughter now let 's look at this things i 'm pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of the new yorker magazine that lovely caslon type and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context it 's making a little bit fun of getting older and you know people might like it but like i said you cannot satisfy everyone you couldn 't satisfy this guy yorker is rather a sensitive environment very easy for people to get their nose out of joint and one of the things you all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh in the new yorker it goes out to a wide audience and when you actually look that and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor is really interesting let 's look at this cartoon discouraging data on the antidepressant you would think well look most was funny in general that seems like a funny cartoon but let 's look what online survey i did but look at the individual responses i like animals look how much they like them i don 't want to hurt them that doesn 't seem very funny to me to people like this i point out we use anesthetic ink humor is a type of entertainment all entertainment contains a little frisson of danger something that might happen wrong and yet we like it when there 's protection that 's a bad zoo it 's but it 's a bad zoo but this is a worse one so in dealing with humor in the context of the new yorker and we have one thousand cartoons of course many many cartoons must be rejected now we could fit more cartoons in the magazine if we removed the articles one i could live with but still huge but they mostly are going to be rejected that 's the nature of any creative activity many of them fade away some of them stay matt diffee is one of them here 's one of his cartoons drew dernavich accounting night at the improv now is the part of the show when we ask the audience to shout out some random numbers i know all about rejection because when i quit actually i was booted out of psychology school and decided to become a cartoonist a natural segue from one thousand nine hundred and seventy four to one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven i submitted two thousand cartoons to the new yorker and got two thousand cartoons rejected by the new yorker this rejection slip i broke into the new yorker and started selling cartoons finally in one thousand nine hundred and eighty i received the revered new yorker contract which i blurred out parts because it 's none of your business nowhere in the contract is the word cartoon mentioned so what is an idea drawing an idea drawing is something that it requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon you get my cast of cartoon mind there is no justice in the world there is some justice in the world the world is just this is what lemmings believe new yorker and i when we made comments you know it 's my view basically about religion that the the real conflict and all the fights between religion is who and this is my most well known cartoon no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you it 's it 's even on thongs but compressed to how about never is never good for you now these look like very different forms of humor but actually they bear a great that really is how you have the propriety of the new yorker and the vulgarity of the language basically that 's the way humor works so i 'm a humor analyst you would say now there won 't be any genocide but really it makes me the laughing audience there are who is he he 's the critic and really i 'm forced to be in that position when i 'm at the new yorker and that 's the danger that i will become sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that many cartoons so many that there are many books called the rejection collection the rejection collection is not quite new yorker kind of humor and you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking see that 's probably not going to be new yorker humor it 's actually put together by matt diffee one of our cartoonists you have an interesting the guilty laugh the laugh against your better judgment cartoons you never saw and never will see in the new yorker this humor is perfect i 'm going to explain why there 's a concept about humor about it being a benign violation if we think it 's completely wrong we say that 's not that 's true of no thursday 's out how about never is never good for you it 's rude the world really shouldn 't be so within this context the violation everything will be within the context and our expectations one way to look at it is this it 's sort of called a meta motivational theory about how we look a theory about motivation and the mood we 're in and how the mood we 're in determines the things we like or dislike we want high arousal feel excited then if we 're in a purposeful mood that makes us anxious the rejection collection is absolutely in this field you want to be stimulated you want to be aroused you want to be transgressed it 's like this like an amusement if you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough they will laugh at very very little this is another cartoon from the rejection collection cartoon about terrorism the new yorker occupies a very different space it the cartoons are different now i 'm going to show you cartoons the new yorker did right after nine eleven a very very sensitive area when humor could be used how would the new yorker attack it it would not be with a guy with a this happened after the muhammad controversy where it 's muhammad in heaven the suicide bomber is all in little pieces and he 's saying to the suicide bomber you 'll get the better left undrawn the first week we did no cartoons that was a black hole for humor and correctly so it 's not always appropriate every time but the next week this was the first cartoon i thought i 'd never laugh again then i saw your jacket it basically was about if we were alive we were going to laugh we were going to breathe we were going to exist here 's another one i figure if i don 't have that third martini then the terrorists win these cartoons are not about them they 're about us and it 's perfectly legitimate is it 's it 's not our humor here 's another cartoon i wouldn 't mind living in a fundamentalist islamic state target is us the target is the readership and the people who do it the humor is self reflective and makes us think about our assumptions three years your junior your age on the dot exactly your age and so the new yorker is also trying to in some way make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us here then it became a moral choice and now it 's just to annoy people excuse me i think there 's something wrong with this in a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint so it focuses on our obsessions our narcissism our foils and our foibles really not someone else 's the new yorker demands some cognitive work on your part and what it demands is what arthur koestler who wrote the act of creation about the relationship between humor if the different frames of reference don 't come together in about 5 seconds it 's not funny but i think they will for you here different frames of reference and this is einstein in bed to you it was fast now there are some cartoons that are puzzling like this cartoon would puzzle many people how many people know what this cartoon means the dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk this is the signal for a that 's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called i don 't get it the new yorker cartoon i q test but the way incongruity works is observational humor is humor within the realm of reality my boss is always telling me what to do cowboy to a cow very impressive i 'd like to find five thousand more like you here in the nonsense range damn it hopkins didn 't you get yesterday 's memo now that 's a little puzzling right it doesn 't quite come together in general people who enjoy more nonsense enjoy more abstract art but for us and for me helping design the humor it doesn 't make any sense to compare one to the other it 's sort of a smorgasbord that 's made so i want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon and i think this sums up the whole thing really about the new yorker cartoons it sort of makes you stop and think doesn 't it and now when you look at new yorker cartoons i 'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about"
