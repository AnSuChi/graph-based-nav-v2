  "transcript": "mathematician named georg cantor and cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line so he starts out with one line he ends up with an infinite number of lines each of which has an infinite number of points in it and this blew his mind literally he checked into a sanitarium and when he came out of he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be god himself he was a very religious man he and other mathematicians did the same sort of thing a swedish mathematician von koch decided that instead of subtracting lines he would add them and there 's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape we can use any any seed shape we like and ok and now mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down you measure a longer and longer length and since they went the length goes to infinity this made no sense at all so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books they said these are pathological curves and we don 't have to discuss them and then in you get the human lungs you get acacia trees you get ferns you get these beautiful natural forms if you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet go ahead and do that now and is covered with fractals the mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes they were breathing those words with fractal lungs it 's very ironic and i 'll show you a little natural recursion here again we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape so here 's the second iteration and the third fourth and and so on so so i got a fulbright scholarship to to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals which is a great job if you can get it and so i finally got to city and i 'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold but when i got there and my french is not very good i said something like i am a mathematician and i would like to stand on your roof but he was really cool about it and he took me up there and we we knew about a rectangle within a rectangle and the path through that palace is actually this this spiral here and as you go through the path you have to get more and more polite so they 're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling it 's a conscious the rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back and then you have the chief 's ring here towards the back and then the chief 's immediate family so here 's a little fractal model for it here 's one house with the sacred altar here 's the house of houses the family enclosure with the humans here where the sacred altar would be and then here 's the village as a whole a ring of ring of rings now you might wonder how can people fit in a tiny village only this big that 's because they 're spirit people it 's the ancestors and of course the spirit people i saw this diagram drawn by a french architect and i thought wow what a beautiful fractal so i tried to come up with a seed shape which upon iteration would unfold into this thing i came up with this structure i realized the whole village kind of spirals around just like this and here 's that replicating replicating line a self replicating line that that unfolds into the fractal well i noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at i said can you take me to the square building i think we can take you there but you can 't go inside because that 's the sacred altar where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this and the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales so here 's a nankani village in mali and you can see you go inside the family enclosure you go inside and here 's pots in the fireplace stacked recursively here 's calabashes that that infinity is important now you might ask yourself three questions at this point aren 't these scaling patterns just universal to all must have a kind of bottom up architecture but that turns out not to be true i started collecting aerial photographs of so native americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry but it 's rectangular at the smaller scale right it is not the same pattern at two different scales you ignoring the diversity of african cultures first of all i agree with mudimbe 's wonderful book the invention of africa that africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism and then oppositional movements no because a widely shared design practice doesn 't necessarily give you a unity of culture and it definitely is not in the dna so they 're similar to themselves but they 're not necessarily similar to each other you see very different uses for fractals it 's a shared technology in africa well isn 't this just intuition it 's not really mathematical knowledge africans can 't possibly really be using fractal geometry right it wasn 't invented until the 1970s well it 's true that some african fractals so some of these things i 'd wander around the streets of dakar asking people what 's the algorithm what 's the rule for making this and they 'd say well we just make it that way because it looks pretty stupid but sometimes that 's not the case in some cases and very sophisticated algorithms so in manghetu sculpture you 'd see this recursive geometry in ethiopian crosses you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape people draw lines in the sand and it 's what the german mathematician euler called you learn the and finally all over africa you see this board game bao in and the folks you 'll see this so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things this guy in in mali just outside of bamako he said well if i lived in the jungle i would only use the long rows of straw because they 're very quick and they 're very cheap it doesn 't take much time doesn 't take much straw now the tight rows up at the very top they really hold out the wind and dust but it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of straw because they 're really we know from experience and i so these guys are right on target for for a practical use of of scaling technology the most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that i found was actually not in geometry it was in a symbolic code and this was bamana sand divination and the same divination system is found all over africa you can find it on the east coast as well as well as the west coast and often the the symbols are very well preserved so each of these symbols has four binary word you draw these lines in the sand randomly and i couldn 't understand where they were getting they only did the randomness four times i couldn 't understand where they were getting the other twelve symbols and they wouldn 't tell me they said let me explain georg cantor in one thousand eight hundred and seventy seven and i started explaining why i was there in in africa and they got very excited when they saw the cantor set and one of them said come here i think i can help you out here and so he took me through the initiation ritual for for a bamana priest and of course i was only interested in the math so the whole time he kept shaking his head going you know i didn 't learn it this way but i had to sleep with and finally he revealed the the truth of the matter and it turns out it 's a pseudo random number generator using deterministic chaos when you have so even plus odd gives you odd odd plus even gives you odd even plus even gives you even odd plus odd gives you even it 's addition modulo two just like in the parity bit check on your computer and you put it back in so it 's a self generating diversity of symbols they 're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this now because it 's a you can actually implement this in hardware what a fantastic teaching tool that should be and the the most interesting thing i found out about it was historical in the 12th century hugo of santalla brought it from islamic mystics into spain and there it entered into the the alchemy community as geomancy divination through the earth this is a the german mathematician talked about geomancy in his dissertation called de combinatoria and we can count by powers of two so all these these little every digital circuit in the world started in africa and i know brian eno says there 's there 's not enough africa in computers but you know i don 't think there 's enough african history in brian eno so let me end with just a few words about the applets are all free they just run in the browser the national science foundation 's broadening participation in computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools so hopefully in three years anybody 'll be able to go on the web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts we 've focused in the u s on we 've found statistically significant improvement so it 's really very successful we 've started a pilot program in we got kerry in bernard tschumi at columbia university has finished using this in a design for a museum of african art david hughes at he 's used some of these fractal structures"
