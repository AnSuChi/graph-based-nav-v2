  "transcript": "what i do in life telling stories writing novels and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called i was born in strasbourg france and i came to turkey with my mom from then on i was raised as a single child by a single mother now in the early 1970s in ankara that was a bit unusual our neighborhood was full of large families where fathers were the heads of households in fact i grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood on the one hand was my mother a well educated this was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye then one by one she would encircle these thorns with dark ink a week later the patient would come back for a follow up examination but the truth is of all the people who visited my but also beware of the power of circles amongst many other things one very precious lesson that if you want to destroy something in this life be it an acne a blemish but if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for then we too run the risk of drying up inside and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons our friends neighbors colleagues family if all the people in our inner circle resemble us it means we are surrounded with our mirror image now one other thing women like my grandma do in turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out it 's an old eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it 's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection ironically [ living in ] communities of the among liberals and conservatives agnostics and believers the rich and the poor east and west alike and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people in my opinion one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling but they can punch holes in our mental walls and through those holes we can get a glimpse of the other and sometimes even like what i was constantly telling stories at home which was good except i told this to imaginary friends around me which was i was an introverted child to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when i bumped into them so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day to day experiences and emotions what she didn 't know was that i thought my life was terribly boring instead i began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened and thus began my passion for writing fiction so from the very beginning fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives other possibilities and please bear with me i 'll draw a circle and come back to this point it was here that i had my first encounter with what i call the representative foreigner yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan except whenever something negative with regards to a nation or a religion took place ridiculed and and i should know because during the time i attended that school a military takeover happened in my country a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the pope and turkey got zero points in [ the ] eurovision song contest i also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there the other children asked and they wondered at what age i would start covering my hair i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country politics cigarettes and the veil after spain we went to jordan germany and ankara again continuity and coherence the three big cs that i otherwise lacked in my mid twenties i moved to istanbul the city i adore i lived in a very vibrant diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels i was in istanbul when the earthquake hit in when i ran out of the building at three in the morning i saw something that stopped me in my tracks i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk but i 've always believed that stories too have a similar effect on us i 'm we leave our small cozy apartments behind i started i 'm not an immigrant refugee or exile they ask me why i do this and i love writing in english so i feel connected to each language in a different way is you live there with with a continuous and that gap is very intimidating but if we manage not to be frightened by and this is what i discovered in boston that frustration was very stimulating started to include in her daily prayers that i urgently get married so that i did get married but instead of settling down i went to arizona and since my husband is in istanbul i started commuting between arizona and istanbul the two places on the surface of earth that couldn 't be more different i guess one part of me has always been a nomad physically and spiritually stories accompany me keeping my pieces and memories together like an existential glue yet as much as i love stories and this is a subject that i would love to think about together when my first novel written in english came out in america i heard an interesting remark from a literary critic i liked your book he said but i wish you had written it differently i asked him what he meant by that he said well look at it there 's so many spanish american hispanic characters in it but there 's only one turkish character and it 's a man but i understood what my critic was looking for and i also understood that i would keep disappointing him he wanted to see the manifestation of my identity he was looking for a turkish woman in the book because i happened to be one but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated read and reviewed many authors feel this pressure but non western authors feel it more heavily if you 're a woman writer from the muslim world like me then you are expected to write the stories of muslim women and preferably the unhappy stories of unhappy muslim women you 're expected to write informative poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant garde to your western colleagues what i experienced as a child in that school in madrid is happening in the literary world today but as the the writer and commuter james baldwin gave an interview in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality when the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer baldwin stopped and said but don 't you see there 's nothing in me that is not in everybody else and nothing in everybody else that is not in me i never forget my first multicultural we were three writers one from the philippines one turkish and one indonesian like a joke you know and the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste it was only because of our passports multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories not so much the imaginary a function is attributed to fiction in this way not only the writers themselves and i experienced this firsthand when i was put on trial in two thousand and five for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel i had intended to write a constructive multi layered novel about an armenian and a turkish family through the eyes of women my micro story others but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction it was just a story and when i say just a story i 'm not trying to belittle my work i want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is not as a means to an end writers are entitled to their political opinions and there are good political novels out there but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics and only the latter is an artist 's responsibility identity politics divides us fiction connects one is interested in sweeping generalizations the other in nuances one draws boundaries the other recognizes no frontiers politics is made of solid bricks fiction is flowing water in the ottoman times there were itinerant storytellers called meddah they would go to coffee houses where they would tell a story in front of an audience often improvising with each impersonating that character everybody could go and listen you know ordinary people even the sultan muslims and the balkans and asia and vice versa it is not good literature timid child that i was that i once was but i 'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them when the poet and mystic rumi met his spiritual companion shams of tabriz one of the first things the latter did was to toss rumi 's books into water and watch the letters dissolve the sufis say knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance the problem with today 's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge we know a lot about each other or so we think but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves it makes us elitist distant and disconnected there 's a metaphor which i love living like a drawing compass as you know one leg of the compass is static rooted in a place meanwhile the other leg draws a wide circle constantly moving like that my fiction as well one part of it is rooted in istanbul with strong turkish roots but the other part travels the world which was the residence of ottoman sultans for more than four hundred years i 'm intrigued by this concept we usually distrust we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness but my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most when i write fiction i cherish i might write about a muslim woman in one novel and perhaps it will be a very happy and in my next book i might write about a handsome gay professor in norway and yet why is it that in creative writing courses today the very first thing we teach students is write what you know imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is we should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next and i would like to finish with an the earth shall be left to no one"
