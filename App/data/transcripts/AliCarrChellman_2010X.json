  "transcript": "and it 's a serious problem with boys their culture isn 't working in schools and i 'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem first i want to start by saying this is a boy and if i essentialize gender for you today then you can dismiss what i have to say so i 'm not going to do that i 'm not interested in doing that this is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl so the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we most boys tend to be a certain way and most girls tend to be a certain way and the point is that for boys the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn 't working well in schools now how do we know that the one hundred girls project tells us some really nice for every one hundred girls in special education there are two hundred and seventeen boys for every one hundred girls with a learning disability there are two hundred and seventy six boys for every one hundred girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed we have three hundred and twenty four boys and by the way all of these if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school and if you are a boy you 're four times as likely to be diagnosed with adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder now there is another side it is important that we recognize that and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years and so we should in because they 've done a lot of good for girls in these situations and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too even in their older years what we find is that there 's still a problem when we look at the universities sixty percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now and in fact university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to seventy percent female population in universities and so we 're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university if you talk to faculty they may say ugh yeah well they 're playing video games and they 're gambling online all night long and they 're playing world of warcraft and that 's affecting their academic achievement guess what video games are not the video games are a symptom they were turned off a long time before they got here so let 's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and thirteen the first is zero tolerance a kindergarten teacher i know her son donated donated all of his toys to her and when he did she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns you can 't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing what is it that we 're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can 't roughhouse on not advocating for bullies i 'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives in the school but when we say that an eagle scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school i think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys a lot of classrooms today you 're not allowed to write about anything that 's violent you 're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games these topics are banned boy comes home from school and he says i hate writing why do what is she telling you to write and little moments in my life i don 't want to write that stuff well what do you want to write what do you want to write about i want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody all right ok you tell a teacher that and they 'll ask you in all seriousness should we send this child to the psychologist he 's just a little boy so that 's the first reason zero tolerance policies and the way they 're lived out the next reason that boys ' cultures are out of sync with school cultures we went from fourteen percent to seven percent that means that ninety three percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women women are great yep absolutely but male role models for boys that say it 's all right to be smart they 've got dads they 've got they 've got cub scout leaders but and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist so i guess i 'd better so that may be a very direct the lack of male presence in the culture you 've got a teachers ' lounge and they 're having a conversation about joey and johnny who beat each other up on the playground what are we going to do with these boys the answer to that question changes depending on who 's sitting around that table are there men around that we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there when you 're three you better be able to write your name legibly or else we 'll consider it a developmental delay by the time you 're in first grade you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture maybe not in a book of maybe twenty five to if you don 't we 're probably going to be putting you into a title i special reading program and if you ask title i teachers they 'll tell you the reason that this is a problem is because the message that boys are getting is you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time the teacher 's salary depends on no child left behind and race to the top and accountability and testing and and all of this so she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through this curriculum and girls this compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids and what happens is she says manage your time focus be a girl that 's and so this is a very serious problem where is it coming from it 's coming from us we want to live in lake wobegon where every child is above average so what do we do we need to meet them where they are we need to put ourselves into boy culture we need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools more specifically most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards they don 't have the depth the rich narrative we need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians we need to make sure that people see that we need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them all of those conversations need to be happening there are some great examples out there of schools the new york times just talked about a school recently a game designer from the we need to find more money for game design because good games really good games cost money and world of warcraft has quite a budget most of the educational games do not where we started my colleagues mike petner shawn vashaw myself we started by trying to look at the teachers ' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming what do they say about it who talk about gaming in pretty demeaning ways they 're always talking about that stuff they 're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges or whatever it is that they get and they 're always talking about this stuff and they say these things as if it 's ok but if it were your culture think of how that might feel it 's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of they 're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies they are sure that parents and administrators never accept anything so we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways so that teachers are much more open and and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms because ultimately if we don 't then we 're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying well i guess that was just a place for girls it wasn 't 've got to do gaming or i 've got to do sports if we change these things if we pay attention to these things and we reengage boys in their learning they will leave the elementary schools saying"
