  "transcript": "a tough job to do you know when i looked at the with their connotations and design in all its forms and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks and so on that i wanted to tell you i wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context in order to do that in twenty minutes i have to bring out four ideas maybe you would go back with the first piece of the puzzle is remoteness i mean two or three different kinds of things of course remoteness in its normal sense which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center you get to remoter areas what happens to education the second or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large you have pockets like slums or shantytowns or poorer areas which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city so it 's us and them the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers and if they had some infrastructure they have difficulty maintaining so what i did last year was we hired a car looked up on google found a route into northern india from new delhi which you know which did not cross any big cities drove out about although you need to consider it carefully i mean this is a very small sample you quite clear that for this particular route that i had taken the remoter the school was the worse its results seemed to be and i tried to correlate it with or with the availability of electricity and things like that it did not correlate it did not correlate with the size of classrooms it did not correlate with the but what happened was that when i administered a questionnaire to each of these schools with one single question for the teachers which was would you like to move to an urban metropolitan area sixty nine percent of them said yes and as you can see from that say yes just a little bit out of delhi and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of delhi i would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that i wish i was in some other school probably has a deep impact on to the results so it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools as opposed to it appears that way when you take education and technology then i find in the literature that you know things like websites collaborative environments you 've been listening to all that in the morning it 's always piloted first the literature one part of it the scientific literature consistently blames et as because it 's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting let 's say eighty percent of whatever they could do you put in this new super duper technology and now they get eighty three percent so the principal looks at it and says three percent for three hundred thousand dollars forget where the score was thirty percent and let 's say took that up to forty percent that will be a completely different thing so the the relative change that et educational technology would make would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top but so i came to this conclusion that et should reach the underprivileged not the other way about and finally came the question of how do you tackle teacher perception whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology the teacher 's first reaction is you cannot replace a teacher with a machine it 's impossible c clarke the science fiction writer whom i met he said something which completely solves this problem he said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine should be so you know it puts the teacher into a tough bind you have to think so i 'm proposing that an alternative primary education whatever alternative you want is required where schools don 't exist where schools are not good enough where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough for reason if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies then you don 't need an alternative education i won 't name the area but somewhere in the world people said we don 't have this problem because we we have perfect teachers and perfect schools i 'm going to talk about children and and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like they 're called the the first one was done in new delhi in and ninety nine and what we did over there was i had an office in those days which bordered a they cut a hole inside that wall which is how it has got the name hole in the wall and put put a pretty powerful pc into that hole sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end touchpad similarly embedded into the wall put it on high speed internet put the internet explorer there put it on altavista com in those days and just left it there and this is what so that was my office in it sort of raised more questions than it answered is this real does the language matter because he 's not supposed to know english will the computer last or will they break it and steal it can you show me how to do it and then somebody taught him this time in a city called of india where i was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building this is the first kid who came there he later on turned out to be a 13 year old school dropout he came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad very quickly he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen and later on he told me i have never seen a television where you can do something so he figured that out it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television and then as he was doing that he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad you 'll see him do that did that and the internet explorer changed page eight minutes later he looked from his hand to the screen and he was browsing he was going back and forth when that happened he started calling all the neighborhood children like children would come and see what 's happening over here so we we thought that this is what was happening that children in groups to use a computer and the internet but under what circumstances at this time there was a the main question was about english people said you know you really ought to have this in shall i translate the internet into some indian language it has to be the other way about but let 's see how do the children tackle the english language i took the experiment out to northeastern india to a village called madantusi where and i built a similar hole in the wall one big difference in the villages as opposed to the urban slums there were more girls than boys who came to the i left the computer there with lots of cds i didn 't have any internet so when i came back there we 've picked it up from the cds so i said but how did you understand what 's going on over there so they said well you 've left this machine which talks only in english so we had madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to i got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable if they happen everywhere else india is a good place to and also all the so i could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of india this is the himalayas up in the north very cold i also had to check so i needed different climates for which india is also we have very cold very hot and so on this is the desert to the west near the pakistan border and you see here a little clip of one of these villages the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the english alphabet then to central india very warm moist fishing villages where humidity is a very big so we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running i want to just cut this short and this happens very often with these computers that the younger children are found teaching the older ones we found that six to 13 year olds can self instruct in a connected environment irrespective of so if they have access to the computer they will teach themselves including intelligence i couldn 't find a single correlation with anything so here was the power of what a group of children can do if you lift the adult intervention just a quick idea of the measurements we took standard statistical techniques so i 'm going to not talk about that but we got a clean learning curve almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school it sort of says it all doesn 't it games and educational material music downloads video in short what all of us do and over three hundred children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer so that 's not how it 's happening what you have actually is there is one child operating the computer and surrounding him are usually three other children who are advising him on what they should do if you test them all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them around these four are usually a group of about sixteen children who are also advising usually wrongly about everything that 's going on on the computer and all of them also will clear a test given on that subject so they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing it seems counter intuitive to adult learning but remember eight year olds live in a society where most of the time they are told don 't do this you know and if you tested so they seem to be able to acquire very quickly so what was the conclusion over the six years of work it was that primary education can happen on its own or parts of it can happen on its own it the third piece was on values i conducted a test over five hundred children spread across all over india and asked them i gave gave them about sixty eight different i simply took those questions where i got fifty percent yeses and fifty percent noes so i was able to get a collection of sixteen such statements these were areas where the children were clearly confused because half said yes and half said no a typical example being sometimes it is necessary to tell lies they don 't have a way to determine which way to answer this question perhaps none of us i won 't say too much because you 've been hearing all about it natural systems are all self organizing galaxies molecules cells organisms societies except for the debate about an intelligent designer but at this point in time as far as science goes it 's self organization so here are my four sentences then remoteness affects the quality of education educational technology doctrine and dogma are imposed and learning is most likely a self organizing system if you put all the four it gives according to me it gives us a goal a vision for educational technology an educational technology and pedagogy that is digital automatic fault tolerant minimally invasive connected and self organized and i have such a set of specs this is a brief so i thought i 'd give it a name why don 't we call it and could this be a goal for educational technology in the future so i want to leave that as a thought with you thank"
