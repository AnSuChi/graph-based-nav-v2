  "transcript": "when chris first approached me to speak at ted i said no because i felt like i wasn 't going to be able to make that personal connection you know that i wanted to it 's such a large conference so i said fine ted i mean chris i 'll come on two conditions one i want to speak as early in the morning as possible and two i want to pick the theme for ted two thousand and six and luckily he the theme in two years is going to be cute pictures of puppies compliments of the day and my best wishes to you and family i know this letter will come to you but let it not be a surprise to you for nature has a way of arriving unannounced and as an adage says originals are very hard to find but their echoes sound ouder so i decided to contact you myself for you to assure me of safety and honesty if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody i am mr micheal bangura the son of late mr thaimu bangura who was the minister of finance in sierra leone but was killed during the civil war knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business on which premise i write you before my father death he had the sum of twenty three million united states dollars which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war this fund was supposed to be used when the war broke out the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him my father insisted it was not in his possession and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund meanwhile my mother and i is the only person who knows about it because my father made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker who used his official van to transport the money to lungi airport freetown although he did not know the real contents of the box the fund was deposited as a family reasure in a safe reliable security company in dakar senegal where i was only given temporary asylum i do not wish to invest the money in senegal due to unfavorable economic climate and so close to my country the only assistance i need from you which i know you would do for me are the following one be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust two provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted three receive the funds into your account in trust take out your commission and leave the rest of the money until i arrive after the transfer is complete sincerely mr micheal bangura i only prepared fifteen so if it 's cool i 'd like to just wait for three i mean no i mean like in the ted sense eight hundred and sixty am i good and that 's nothing to be ashamed of that 's nothing to be ashamed of i was hanging out with some google guys last night really cool we were getting wasted and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that based on your interaction with google over your lifetime they can actually predict and i was and they said that i could just type in what was i going to say next and it would tell me and i have to tell you this is an unadulterated piece of software this is a real internet browser and this is the actual google site and we 're going to test it out live today that 's me am i feeling lucky of two thousand and one i filmed myself dancing to madonna 's justify my love on a thursday i sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to seventeen of my closest friends as part of an invitation to my an invitation to my by monday over a million people were coming to this site a day within a week i received a call from earthlink that said due to a ten cents per megabyte overage charge i owed them thirty thousand dollars but some people refer to me more as like an internet guru or [ jackass ] swami laughter i knew i it 's unfortunate that i don 't have more time maybe i can come back next year or something like that i 'm obsessed with email i get a lot of it and it 's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know you know it 's like a microscope to the rest of the world you can kind of peer into other people 's lives and i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration from the average user for example somebody wrote if you ever come to boulder you should rock out with us and i said why wait [ rocking out ] and they said hey ze thanks for rocking out but i meant the kind of rocking out where we 'd be naked laughter and that was embarrassing i hear a lot of you whispering and i know what you 're saying holy crap how is his presentation so smooth and i have to say that it 's not all me this year i guess chris has to take some credit here because in years past i guess there 's been some sort of subpar speakers at ted i don 't know and so this year chris sent us a ted conference simulator which really allowed us as speakers to get there in the trenches and practice at home so that we would be ready you know it 's really really great to be here i 'd like to tell all of you a little joke you can do heckler mode just one last thing i 'd like to say the first time that i made love to a rock shrimp all aware of this but the the video game market kids are playing these video games so i decided to try my hand i came up with a few games this is called atheist i figured it would be popular with the young kids really understand why you 're laughing should have done this before i tried to pitch it and this is great because you know for a quarter you can play this for a long time and chris had said in an email that we should really bring something new to ted something that we haven 't shown anyone so i made this for ted it 's christian it 's the third in the series i 'm hoping it 's going to do so you can wait for the second coming which is a random number between one and five hundred million laughter so really what are we talking about here tech joy to me means something because i get a lot of joy out of tech making things using technology and i 'm being serious here even though i 'm using my sarcastic voice i won 't hold on making things you know making and it 's that feeling of being about eighty percent complete on a project where you know you still have something to do but it 's not finished and you 're not starting something that really fills my entire life and so what i 've done is i started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don 't consider themselves artists so i try to create these these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves and hopefully try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves here i created a contest called when office supplies attack which i think really resonated with the working population hundred entries in three weeks toilet paper fashion laughter again people from all over the country the watch is particularly incredible online drawing tools you 've probably seen a lot of them i think they 're wonderful it 's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff but i 'm interested in the process as the real event that i 'm interested in and the problem is is that a lot of people suck at drawing awful little thing that they created and eventually it just makes them stop playing with it or they draw penises and things like that the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool in other words and it collaborates with you to create sort of a post war german etching it 's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse so we go ahead and we start scribbling but watch something really crappy look beautiful and here are some of my favorites this is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me it 's a really fun and wonderful thing so this is called the fiction project this is none of the haikus were written by the same person in fact each line is contributed by a different person at a different time i think that the now tied up tied down mistress cruel approaches me now tied down it 's up it 's an chills you to the very core but it 's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together doing fun things they actually get to know each other and it 's sort of peripheral activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we 're lacking and very very quickly lotte reiniger an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s that started doing more elaborate things i became interested in puppets and i just want to show one last thing to you oh this is how you make puppets"
