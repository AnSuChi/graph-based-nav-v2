  "transcript": "they are first cousins and you know what happens when you know so there 's a terribly weird freaky side to me which i 'm fighting with all the time so to try and get through today i 've kind of disciplined myself with an 18 minute talk i was hanging on to have a pee i thought perhaps if i was hanging on long enough that would guide me through the eighteen minutes i am known as captain organic and that 's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position but today what i 'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people 's soul and emotion not many and i don 't think we 've lost that coding system but i 'm interested in creating this artificially induced consumerism i think it 's atrocious i 'm in that world but i work i 'm not a scientist i could have been perhaps but i work in this world where i trust my instincts so i am a translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with and we should be developing things we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people 's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig of the earth and translate into products for everyday use so the water bottle i 'll dna design nature art these are the three things that condition my world here is it shows how and instinct work to create amazing art industrial design is the art form of the 21st century people like leonardo there have not been many had this amazingly instinctive curiosity i work from a similar position i don 't want to sound pretentious saying that but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago well into the i use now a whole new process a few years ago i reinvented my process to keep up with people like greg lynn rem koolhaas all these people that i think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create but i just feel in my bones that that 's possible this is the background this is the final product when they it was when i put the water in that i realized that i 'd put a skin on water itself it 's an icon of water itself it elevates people 's perception it 's a millefiori of ideas they will look like that because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things perhaps in life for materials will come into play in probably a decade it i have this special interest in things which once existed and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking when i look at these things but these things evolved over many years and what we 're trying to do i get three weeks to design a telephone how the hell do i do when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve how do you condense that it comes back to instinct i 'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that and i 'm not looking at designing architecture like that i 'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates how that flows through me and how that comes out this is a scan through the it 's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure i have these in my office my office is a mixture of the natural history museum and this is made bone is made from a mixture of i studied cooking in school for four years and in that in that experience which was called domestic science it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification actually i put marijuana in everything i cooked and i had access to all the best girls it was fabulous all the guys in the rugby team couldn 't understand anyway this is another sample i have a meringue is made exactly the but i believe instinctively that that meringue can become something i 'm also interested in growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grows things shown pretty much it 's the world 's first chair made in magnesium it cost one point seven million dollars to develop it 's called go it went into time magazine boy for somebody growing up in wales in a little village that 's and then you break up what you need this is an absolutely beautiful way of working it 's a godly way of working when that moves into polymers you can change the elasticity and they look funky too but i don 't set out to make funky things because i think that 's an absolute disgrace i set out to look at natural forms if you took the idea of it could be a sole for a sports shoe it could be a car blending into seats wow let 's go for it that 's the kind of stuff this is what exists in nature observation now allows us to bring that natural process it 's called superliquidity it 's my sculptural investigation still your hair stands up there 's some amazing spiritual connect if he was a car designer it contributes immensely to our sense of being our sense of relationships with things our sensuality and you know the sort of even the ironically that object was made by the killarney when i look into these these data images i see new things it coral all these natural forces take away what they don 't need and they deliver we need to be gas injected polymer chair those holes you see there are very filtered down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures it 's great to have companies in italy who support this way of dreaming it takes away any material you don 't need and it actually break into a dance then it 's based on furniture typologies but that 's not the as opposed to aluminium and it 's grown it 's grown in my mind and then it 's grown in terms of the the whole process that i who build parts for bentleys and so on it 's being built as we speak and it will be on show in phillips next year in new york i have a big show with phillips auctioneers this is what goes on in my studio everyday i walk i 'm traveling i come back so i try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio this kind of effervescent fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas single surface products furniture 's a good one i would love to build this one day and perhaps i 'd like to build it also out of that 's the weird side coming out again you get into biopolymers they looked straight through me they 're not taking i 've had this image twenty years i 've had this image of a water droplet for twenty years sitting on a hot bed like i can 't believe i 'm going to show you something a bit weird now they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this the only place that didn 't laugh was moscow cars are made from thirty thousand components how ridiculous is that couldn 't you make that from three hundred it 's got a pan everything 's holistically integrated it opens and closes like a bread bin there is no engine there 's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels they 're fitted like formula one you take them separated from life there 's a hole at the front you get out it 's a street lamp that 's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first and do the car second i can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages floating around when i showed this in south africa everybody afterwards was going hey car on a stick can you imagine a car on a stick if you put it next to contemporary architecture it feels totally natural to me and that 's what i do with my furniture i 'm not putting charles eames ' furniture in buildings anymore i 'm trying to build transportation systems i work on aircraft for airbus i do all this sort of stuff it 's a little bit of a because i 'm looking for composites it 's a single element which you wouldn 't want to have a fear of heights coming down it there is next to all the crap it has a lighting system that changes throughout the day my guys go out for lunch the door 's open they come back in because it 's normally raining and they prefer to stay in this is my studio elephant skull from oxford university one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight i bought that last year they 're very difficult to find if anybody 's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me i 'll put it in the studio so i 'm just going to interject interject a little bit with some of the things that you 'll see in the video it 's a homemade video made it myself at three o 'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is you never see that you never see architects or designers showing you their real world this is called we should all be riding one of these as china buys all these crappy cars we should be it 's full of prototypes and objects and i get lots and lots of kids coming i 'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers wankers sorry that 's a solar seed it 's a concept for new architecture that thing on the top is the world 's first garden lamp giles revell should be talking here today amazing photography of things you can 't see the first sculptural lots of stuff there 's a little leaf chair that golden looking thing is called leaf it 's made from kevlar on the wall is my book called supernatural which allows me to remember what i 've done because i forget there 's an aerated brick i did in limoges last year in concepts for new ceramics in architecture gernot oberfell working at three o 'clock in the morning overtime is the passion of design so join the club or don 't no it 's true people like tom and greg we 're traveling like you can 't we fit it next week i 'm at and when i see ed 's photographs i think why the hell am i going to china it 's true if all the people who were talking over this period so there 's a new x light system i 'm doing in japan there 's a copper jelly mold laughter it sounds like some quiz show or something thank you very much"
