  "transcript": "but we haven 't always been that good at figuring out what 's important but they left some parts out but imagine if there were a kind of neglected organ in our bodies that weighed just as much as the brain and in some ways was just as important to who we are but we knew so little about and imagine if through new scientific advances we were just beginning to understand its importance it turns out that we do have something just like that our gut or rather its microbes but it 's not just the microbes in our gut that are important microbes all over our body turn out to be really critical to a whole range of differences that make different people who we are so have you ever noticed how some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others for example i seldom get bitten by mosquitos but my partner amanda and the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin that produce different chemicals that the mosquitos detect now microbes are also really important in the field of medicine so for example what microbes you have in your gut they also determine whether or not other drugs will work for your heart condition and if you 're a fruit fly at least your microbes determine who you want to have sex with we haven 't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it 's just a matter of time before we find out so what would a map of all these microbial communities look like well it wouldn 't look exactly like this but it 's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms that are immediately characteristic of one place or another or another so instead of trying to identify them visually we do is we look at their dna sequences and in a project called the human microbiome project nih funded this $ one hundred and seventy three million project where hundreds of researchers came together so when we take them together they look like this it 's a bit more difficult to tell who lives where now isn 't it what my lab does computational techniques that allow us to take all these terabytes of sequence data and so when we do that with the human microbiome data from two hundred and fifty healthy volunteers it looks like this each point here represents all the complex microbes in an entire microbial community see i told you they basically all look the same so what we 're looking at is each point represents one microbial community from one body site of one healthy volunteer and you can see that there 's different parts of the map in different colors and what it turns out to be is that those as the different regions of the body have very different microbes in them so what we have is we have the oral community up there in green over on the other side we have the skin community in blue the vaginal community and then right so if i look at just one person 's microbes in the mouth and in the gut it turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities is enormous it 's bigger than the difference between the microbes in this reef and the microbes in this prairie so you probably heard that we 're pretty much all the same in terms of our human dna you 're ninety nine point nine nine percent identical in terms of your human dna to the person sitting next to you but that 's not true of your gut microbes you might only share ten percent similarity with the person sitting next to you in terms of your gut microbes so that 's as different as the bacteria on this prairie so these different microbes have all these different kinds of functions that i told you about everything from digesting food to so how do they do all this stuff so they outnumber us ten to one you might think well we also leave traces of our microbial dna on everything we touch we showed in a study it was featured on csi miami so you really know it 's true so where do our microbes come from in the first place well if as i do you have dogs or kids you probably have some dark suspicions about that all of which are true by the way so just like we can match you to your computer equipment by the microbes you share we can also match you up to your dog so even if you live together with someone you 'll maintain your separate microbial identity over a period of weeks months even whereas babies that are delivered by c section and this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with cesarean birth and when you think about until recently every surviving mammal had been delivered by the birth canal and so the lack of those protective microbes that we 've co evolved with might be really important for a lot of these different conditions that we now know involve the microbiome when my own daughter was born a couple of years ago by emergency c section we took matters into our own hands and made sure she was coated with those vaginal microbes that she would have gotten naturally it 's really difficult to tell whether this has had an effect on her health specifically right and what 's more we 're starting to do clinical trials with more children to figure out whether this has a protective effect generally on what microbes we have initially but where do we go after that and you 've seen children you 've seen them develop mentally now for the first time you 're going to see one of my colleague 's children develop and you can see that he 's starting off basically in the vaginal community as we would expect from his delivery mode over these two and a half years is that he 's going to travel all the way down what you can see and remember each step in this is just one week what you can see is that week to week the change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child the differences week to week are much greater than but something amazing is about to happen here so he 's getting antibiotics followed by a relatively and and by the time he reaches despite so does what we do early on where the microbiome is changing so and so what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we 're only beginning to understand and so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same horror that we currently reserve for those metal tools that the egyptians used to use to mush up the brains before they drained them out for embalming so i mentioned that microbes have all these important functions and they 've also now just over the past few years been connected to a whole range of different diseases heart disease colon cancer and even and today we can tell whether you 're lean or obese with ninety percent accuracy by looking at the microbes in your gut because you can probably tell which of these people is obese without knowing anything about their gut microbes but it turns out that even if we sequence their complete genomes and had and then in mice we can do a lot more so in mice microbes have been linked to all kinds of additional conditions including things but how can we tell whether these microbial differences that correlate with disease are cause or effect and see what happens when we take the microbes from an obese mouse and transplant them into a genetically normal mouse that 's been raised in a bubble with no microbes of its own it becomes fatter fatter than if it got them from a regular mouse so they only get fat if we let them eat as much as they want and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person and transplant them into mice you 've raised germ free those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbes from a lean person microbial community that we inoculate them with that prevents them from gaining this weight we can also do this for malnutrition so in a project funded by the gates foundation what we 're looking at is children in malawi who have kwashiorkor a profound form of malnutrition but we can restore their health by using the same peanut and the mice that receive the community from the healthy identical twins of the kwashiorkor children do fine this is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies by trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice with individual people 's gut communities and perhaps tailor those therapies all the way down to the we started this project called american gut which allows you to claim a place for yourself on this microbial map we also release and so forth so anyone can have access to the data it turns out that not everyone wants to know but i 'm guessing that many of you do and so i brought some kits here so why might we want to do this well it turns out that microbes are not just important for finding out where we are in terms of our health but they can actually cure disease this is one of the newest things we 've been able to visualize with colleagues at the university of minnesota so what would happen if we transplanted some of the stool from a healthy donor that star down at the bottom into these patients would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health so let 's watch exactly what happens there and what you can see is that immediately you have this radical change in the gut community so one day after you do that transplant coming to resemble the donor 's community and perhaps even autism and depression what we need to do though is we need to develop a kind of microbial just know where we are currently but also and we need to be able to make this simple enough that even a child can use it"
