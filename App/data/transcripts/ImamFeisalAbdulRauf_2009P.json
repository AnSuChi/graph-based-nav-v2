  "transcript": "i 'm speaking about compassion from an islamic point of view and perhaps my faith is not fourteen chapters and each chapter begins the all merciful or as sir richard burton but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature the compassionate and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity god says to his prophet muhammad including moses and ending with muhammad that we have not sent you o muhammad except as a ' rahmah ' except as a source of compassion to humanity for us human beings and certainly for us as muslims whose and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet and the prophet in one of his sayings said adorn yourselves with the attributes of god and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion in fact the koran says that god decreed upon himself compassion therefore our objective and our mission must be to be actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and good but where where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world in every religious tradition there is the outer path and the inner path or the exoteric path and the esoteric path the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or refer to teachings and examples of our prophet in one of the battles that the prophet waged we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle we are battle weary how can we go to a greater battle he said that is the battle of the self the battle of the ego the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you has a story and a voice answers the voice says go away after many years of training of disciplining of search and struggle he comes back with much greater humility he knocks again on the door you o heartbreaker and the voice says come in for there is no room in this house for two i 's there is no room for more than one i and that is the i of divinity in a teaching called a hadith qudsi in our tradition god says that my servant does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do but don 't ignore what you 've asked them to do and when i love my servant god says i become the eyes by which he the ears by which he or she listens and the foot and the heart by which he or she understands it is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions muslims regard jesus the greatest prophet and messenger who came and i am the way and when the whoever has seen me has seen god it is because they became so much an instrument of god they became part of god 's team so that god 's will was manifest through them and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos compassion on earth is given it is in us all we have to do is to get our egos out of the probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you have had what you might call a spiritual experience a moment in your lives when for a few a minute perhaps the boundaries of your ego dissolved and at that minute you felt at one with the universe one with that jug of water one with every human being one with the creator and you felt you were in the presence of power awe of the deepest love the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives that is a moment which is a gift of god to us a gift when for a moment he lifts that boundary which makes this is all you o creator the objective the source of our being and the end of our journey you are also the breaker of our hearts you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to god to what extent we have been and the purpose of this charter of compassion is to remind for the koran always urges us to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth is within every human being we know it all we have access to it all jung may have called it the subconscious through our subconscious in your dreams the temporary death we travel even outside of our bodies for many of us we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it and beyond but all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator the compassionate god whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity it is the locus of absolute being absolute love and mercy and compassion and absolute knowledge and wisdom but the objective is the same rumi has another story about three men a turk an arab and and i forget the third person but for my sake it could be a malay one is asking for angur one is say an englishman one is asking for eneb not knowing that the word that they 're using refers to the same reality in different languages there 's only one absolute reality by definition because absolute is by definition single and absolute and singular the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human for what defines humanity perhaps biologically but god defines humanity by our spirituality by our nature then fall in prostration to him the angels why because the soul embodies a piece of the divine breath a piece of the divine soul this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image what is the imagery of god imagery of god is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love for us to be human in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being of being alive of beingness the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings this and this is what i understand and this is the common platform and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced that we can make a wonderful world and i believe personally that we 're on the verge and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah for he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore we have reached a stage in human history we must we must national ego and let all be for the glorification of the one"
