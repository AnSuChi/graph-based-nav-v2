  "transcript": "i was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife katya and we were talking about what i was going to talk about today and during a pause in my conversation with katya i looked over at lincoln and i was suddenly thunderstruck by a recollection of a client of mine my client was a guy named will he was from north he never knew his father very well because his father and so he was destined to be raised by a single mom which might have been all right except that this particular single mom and when will was five years old she tried to kill him with a butcher knife she was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric and i realized he 'd been living by himself for two years including most seriously of all a horrible tragic but i don 't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment i certainly think that my client shouldn 't have been executed but what i would like to do today instead is talk about the death penalty in a way i 've never done before in a way that is entirely i think that 's possible because there is a corner of the death penalty debate maybe the most important corner where everybody agrees where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous are on exactly the same page that 's the corner i want to explore and then i want to tell you two lessons that i have learned over the last twenty years as a death penalty lawyer from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way you can think of a death penalty case as a and it 's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate the second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding known as a state habeas corpus appeal the third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding and the fourth chapter but that fourth chapter always ends with an execution so what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers and so inevitably lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four some of these lawyers were successful they managed to get new trials but the one thing that didn 't happen in fact as you can see from this graph from the time that the texas execution apparatus got efficient in the mid to late 1990s there have only been a couple of years where the number of annual executions dipped below twenty in some years in texas we 've executed close to forty people and this number has never significantly declined over the last fifteen years and yet at the same time that we continue to execute about the same number of people every year the number of people who we 're sentencing to death on an annual basis has dropped rather steeply which is that the number of annual executions has remained high why is that it can 't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate because the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply what has happened instead is that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison why has that happened it hasn 't happened because of a dissolution of popular support for the death penalty death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in texas is at an all time low but we can 't explain the decline in death sentences and the affinity so twenty five years ago they focused on chapter four and they went from chapter years ago to chapter three in the late 1980s and they went from chapter three in the late 1980s to chapter two in the mid 1990s and beginning in the mid to late now you might think that this decline in death sentences and the increase in the number of life sentences is a good thing or a bad thing i don 't want to have a conversation about that today my client will i sometimes say if you tell me the name of a death row inmate doesn 't matter what state he 's in doesn 't matter if i 've ever met him before i 'll write his biography for you the details of that biography will be more or less accurate and the reason for that is that eighty percent of the people on death row are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that will did eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system now we 're right on the cusp of that corner where everybody 's going to agree but i think everybody would agree that the best possible version of his story would be a story where no murder ever occurs how do we do that when our son lincoln was working on that math problem that 's what we do for most problems in math the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger the way we solve this problem but what happens before that story begins how can we intervene in the life of a murderer before he 's a murderer what options do we have to nudge that person off of the path that is going to lead to a result that everybody death penalty supporters and death penalty opponents still think is a bad result the murder of an innocent human being you know sometimes people say that something and by that what they mean is rocket science is really complicated and this problem that we 're talking about now is really simple that 's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket what we 're talking about today is just as complicated what we 're talking about today is also rocket science my client will and eighty percent of the people on death row i think of these five chapters as points of intervention places in their lives when our society could 've intervened in their lives and nudged them off of the path that they were on that created a consequence that in his early childhood years when he was in elementary school when he was in middle school and then high school and when he was in the juvenile justice system during each of those five chapters there were a the way that society could intervene in each there are three thousand more than three thousand possible strategies that we could embrace in order to nudge kids like will off of the path that they 're on so i 'm not standing here today with the solution but we know from experience in other states that there are a wide variety of modes of intervention that we could be using in texas and in every other state that isn 't using them in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad i 'll that 's probably a topic that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges instead let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention that we can all help accomplish we could be providing early childhood care and we could be nudging kids like will off of the path that on there are other states that do that but we don 't we could be providing special schools at both the high school level and the middle school level but even in there are a handful of states that do that texas doesn 't we could be intervening much more aggressively and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to if we 're going to do that we need a place to put them and even if that happens there are two professors in the northeast one at yale and one at they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison and most dauntingly of all they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what people don 't come into and out of prison on a semester basis some of the people in the room might be old enough to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial he used to say well you can pay me now or you can pay me later what we 're doing in the death penalty system but the thing is that for every fifteen thousand dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters we save eighty thousand dollars in crime related costs down the road even if you don 't agree that there 's a moral imperative that we do it it was the day that he was going to be executed and we were just and i said to him i know she tried to kill you i said but i 've always wondered whether you really actually remember that i said i don 't remember anything from when i was five years old maybe you just remember somebody telling you and he looked at me and he leaned forward he said professor i don 't mean any disrespect by this but when your mama butcher knife that looks bigger than you are and chases you through the house screaming she 's going to kill you and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom and lean against the door and holler for help until the police get there he looked at me and he said that 's something you don 't forget there are going to be four homicides in the united states but three of those crimes are preventable if we make the picture bigger then we 're never going to write the first sentence thank you"
