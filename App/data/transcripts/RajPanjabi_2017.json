  "transcript": "share with you something my father taught me no condition is permanent it 's a lesson he shared with me again and again and i learned it to be true the hard way here i am in my fourth grade class this is my yearbook picture taken in my class in school in monrovia liberia my parents migrated from india to west africa in the 1970s and i had the privilege of growing up there i was nine years old i loved kicking around a soccer ball and i was a total math and science i was living the kind of life that really any child would dream of but no condition is permanent on christmas eve in one thousand nine civil war erupted in liberia the war started in the rural countryside and within months rebel armies had marched towards our hometown and when the rebel armies captured the only international airport people started panicking and fleeing my mom came knocking one morning and said raj pack your things we have to go and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch of a rescue and there on a bench i was sitting with my heart racing as i looked out the open hatch i saw hundreds of liberians in another line children strapped to their backs when they tried to jump in with us i watched soldiers restrain them and as immigrants we benefitted from the community of that rallied around us they took my family into their home they mentored me i 'd visit my father on weekends as a teenager to help him sell sneakers and jeans and every time business would get bad he 'd remind me of that mantra no condition is permanent that mantra and my parents and that community of supporters made it possible for me to go through college and eventually to medical school i 'd once had my hopes crushed in a war but because of them i had a chance to pursue my dream to become a doctor it had been fifteen years since i escaped that airfield but the memory of those two lines had not escaped my mind i was a medical student in my mid 20s and i wanted to go back to see if i could serve the people we 'd left behind but when i got back what i found was utter destruction the war had left us with just fifty one doctors to serve a country of four million people it would be like the city of san francisco having just ten doctors so if you got sick in the city where those few doctors remain you might stand a chance but if you got sick the remote rural rainforest communities where you could be days from the nearest clinic i was seeing my patients die from conditions no one should die from imagine you have a two year old who wakes up one morning with a fever and you realize she could have malaria and you know the only way to get her the medicine she needs would be take her to the riverbed get in a canoe paddle to the other side and then walk for up to two days through the forest just to reach the nearest clinic one billion people live in the world 's most remote communities and despite the advances we 've made in modern medicine and technology our innovations are not reaching the last mile meet musu way out in rural liberia where most girls have not had a chance to finish primary school musu had been at the age of eighteen she completed high school and she came back to her community so she signed up to be a volunteer there are millions of volunteers like musu in rural parts around our world and we got to thinking community members like musu could actually help us solve a puzzle so we started asking some questions what if we could reorganize the medical care system what if we could community members like musu be a part or even be the center of our medical team what if musu could help us bring health care from clinics in cities to the doorsteps of her neighbors musu was forty eight when i met her and despite her amazing talent and grit she hadn 't had a paying job in thirty years so what if technology could support her what if we could invest in her with real training equip her with real medicines and have her have a real job well i was trying to answer these questions and my wife and i were getting married that we asked our relatives to forgo the wedding registry gifts and instead donate some money so we could have some start up money to launch a nonprofit i promise you i 'm a lot more romantic than that we designed a first we trained musu to prevent diagnose and treat the top ten diseases afflicting families in her village a nurse supervisor visited her every month to coach her we equipped her with modern medical technology like this $ one malaria rapid test and put it in a backpack full of medicines like this to treat infections like pneumonia to help her track and report on epidemics we recognized the dignity in musu 's work with the liberian government we created a paid her and gave her the chance to have a real job and she 's amazing musu has to supporting people with hiv working as part of community health workers can help ensure that a lot of what your family doctor would do reaches the places that most family doctors could never go one of my favorite things to do is to care for patients with community health workers so last year i was visiting a b and like he was in middle school in the eighth grade when his parents died he became an orphan and had to drop out last year we hired and trained a b as a community health worker and while he was making door to door house calls he met this young boy named prince whose mother had had trouble breastfeeding him and by the age of six months prince had started to waste away a b had just been taught how to use this color coded measuring tape that wraps around the upper arm of a child to diagnose malnutrition a b noticed that prince was in the red zone which meant he had to be hospitalized so a b took prince and his mother to the river got in a canoe and paddled for four hours to get to the hospital later after prince was discharged a b taught mom how to feed baby a food supplement a few months ago a b took me to visit prince and he 's a chubby little guy he 's meeting his milestones he 's pulled himself up to a stand and is even starting to say a few words i 'm so inspired by these community health workers i often ask them why they do what they do and when i asked a b since i dropped out of school this is the first time i 'm having a chance to hold a pen to write my brain is getting fresh taught me something fundamental about being human our will to serve others can actually help us transform our own conditions when we faced a global catastrophe he lived in an area where the roads were sparse and there had been massive shortages of health workers airlines started canceling routes at the height of the crisis when we were told that one point four million people could be infected i remember standing with a group of health workers in the rainforest where an outbreak had just happened we were helping train and equip them to put on the masks the gloves and the gowns that they needed to keep themselves safe from the virus while they were serving their patients i remember the fear in their eyes and terrified if i 'd made the right call when ebola threatened to bring humanity to its knees liberia 's community health workers didn 't surrender to fear they did what they had always done they answered the call to serve their neighbors community members across liberia learned the symptoms some ten thousand community health workers risked their own lives to help hunt down this virus and stop it in its tracks today ebola has come under control in west africa and we 've learned a few things and that system has to reach all communities including rural communities like emile 's and most of all we 've learned from the courage of liberia 's community health workers that we as people are not defined by the conditions we face no matter how hopeless they seem we 're defined by how we respond to them for the past fifteen years and i 've seen it play out everywhere from the forest communities of west africa to the rural fishing villages of alaska it so now what we know that there are still millions of people dying from preventable causes in rural communities around the world know that the great majority of these deaths are happening in these seventy five blue shaded countries what we also know is that if we trained an army of community health workers we could save the lives of nearly thirty million people by two thousand and thirty thirty services could save thirty million lives by two that 's not just a blueprint we 're proving this can be done in liberia the liberian government and we 've been honored to work with them and are now teaming up with a number of organizations that are working across other countries to try to help them do the same thing we simply can 't do that though without technology but when it comes to community health workers technology has actually been vital for creating jobs without technology without this smartphone without this rapid test it would have been impossible for us to be able to employ a b and musu and i think it 's time for technology to help us train to help us train people faster and better than ever before up to date and keep certified i use smartphones i he 's got to jump back in that canoe why shouldn 't they have the same access to learn as i do if we truly want community health workers to master those lifesaving skills and even more we 've got to change this model of education and i 've been thinking that it 's time it 's time for a collision between the digital education revolution and the community health revolution and so this brings me to my ted prize wish i wish i wish that you would help us recruit the largest army of community health workers the world has ever known by creating the community health academy a global platform to train connect and empower and curate the best in we will bring those to community health workers around the world including a b and musu they 'll get video lessons on giving kids vaccines and have online courses on spotting the next outbreak so they 're not stuck using flip charts we 'll help these countries accredit these workers so that they 're not stuck remaining an but become a renowned empowered profession just like nurses and doctors and we 'll create a network of companies and entrepreneurs who 've created innovations that can save lives and help them connect to workers like musu so she can help better serve her community including to rural north america with the power of this platform we believe countries can be more persuaded that a health care revolution really is possible my dream is that this academy will contribute to the training of hundreds of thousands of community members to help bring health care to their neighbors the hundreds of millions of them that live in the world 's most remote communities from the forest communities of west africa to the fishing villages of rural alaska let us know if you or your organization or someone you know could help us as we try to build this academy over the next year now i realize that our journeys are not self made they 're shaped by others and there have been so many here that have been part of this cause we i think a lot more about what my father taught me these days i too have become i have two sons and my wife and i just learned that she 's pregnant with our third child thank you applause but unlike my wife had had no prenatal care with her first two babies she lived in an isolated community in the forest that had gone for one hundred years without any health care until until last year when a nurse trained her neighbors to become community health workers so here i was seeing this patient who was in her second trimester and i pulled out the ultrasound to check on the baby and she started telling us stories about her first two had the ultrasound probe on her belly and she just stopped mid sentence what 's that sound it was the first time she 'd ever heard her baby 's heartbeat and her eyes lit up in the same way my wife 's eyes and my own eyes lit up when we heard our baby 's heartbeat for all of human illness has been universal no condition thank you"
