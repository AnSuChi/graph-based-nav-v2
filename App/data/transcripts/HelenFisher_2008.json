  "transcript": "studying people who report that they 're still in love after ten to twenty five years of marriage so this is the short story of that research it was built by the grandest sun king of the grandest city state of the grandest civilization of the americas the mayas he lived into his 80s and he was buried beneath this monument in seven facing his and every spring and autumn exactly at the equinox the sun rises behind his temple and perfectly bathes her temple after one thousand three hundred years these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb they tell as walt whitman once said o i would stake all for you anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in one hundred and seventy societies they 've never found a society that did not have it but love isn 't always a happy experience in one study of college but the two that stood out to me the most were have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved and the second question was have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you and almost ninety five percent of both men and women said yes to both almost nobody gets out of love alive i want to read for you what i think is the most powerful love poem on earth there 's other love poems that are of course just as good kwakiutl indian of southern alaska to a missionary in i 've never had the opportunity to say it before consumed by fire with my love for you i i am torn by your love for me pain and more pain i am told you will leave me here goodbye my love goodbye emily dickinson once wrote parting is all we need to know of hell how many people have suffered in all the millions of years of human evolution how many people around the world are dancing with elation at this very minute so several years ago i decided to look into the brain and study this madness our first study of people who were happily in love has been widely we found activity in some cells called the a10 cells cells that actually make dopamine a natural stimulant and spray it to many brain regions indeed this part the vta is part of the brain 's reward system it 's way below your cognitive thinking process it 's below the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine but romantic love is much more than a cocaine high at least you come down from cocaine romantic love is an obsession it possesses you you lose your sense of self you can 't stop thinking about another human being somebody is camping in your head as an eighth century japanese poet said my longing had no time when it ceases and the obsession can get worse when you 've been rejected so right now lucy brown and i the neuroscientists on our project are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped it was very difficult actually putting these people in the machine because they were in such bad shape so anyway we found activity in three brain regions we found activity you know when you 've been dumped the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being and then go as the poet terence the roman poet once said he said the less my hope the hotter my love we now know why two thousand years later we can explain this in the brain that brain system the reward system for wanting for motivation for craving for focus becomes more active when you we found activity in other brain regions also in a brain region associated with and you 're calculating what went wrong it comes from a david mamet and there 's two con artists in the play and the woman is conning the man and the man looks at the woman and says oh you 're a bad pony i 'm not going to bet on you it 's also the brain region that no wonder people suffer around the world and we have so many crimes of passion moreover this brain circuit for reward is working and you 're feeling intense energy intense focus intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life 's greatest prize come to think that romantic love is a drive a basic mating drive not the sex drive the sex drive gets you looking for a whole range of partners romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy what sums it it up best is something that is said by plato it is a homeostatic imbalance like hunger and thirst it 's almost impossible to stamp out i 've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction a perfectly wonderful addiction when it 's going well and a perfectly horrible addiction when it 's going poorly you obsessively think about them you crave them you distort reality your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person and it 's got the three main characteristics of addiction tolerance you need to see them more and more and more i 've got a girlfriend who 's just getting over a terrible love affair it 's been about eight months she 's beginning to feel better and she was driving along in her car the other day and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio that reminded her of this man not only did the instant craving come back but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry so one thing i would like the medical community and the legal community and even the college community too stupid and they won 't do it unless you 're stuck in a laboratory cage and you know if you spend your entire life in a little box you 're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with but i 've looked in a hundred species animals have favorites as a matter of fact ethologists know this there are over eight words for what they call animal favoritism selective proceptivity and indeed there are now three academic articles in which they 've looked at this attraction which may only last for a second but it 's a definite attraction i think animal attraction can be instant you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant and i think that this is really the origin of what you and i call love at first sight spoiled it for me and i just simply say hardly but it 's really deepened my understanding i often catch myself looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the for the tot and when i think of how intense this brain system is our newest experiment has been hatched and indeed we found exactly the same thing they 're not lying the brain areas associated with intense romantic love still become active twenty five years there are still many questions to be answered and asked about romantic love the question that i 'm working on right this minute and i 'm only going to say it for a second and then end is why do you fall in love with one person rather than another i never would have even thought to think of this but match com the internet dating site came to me three years ago and asked me that question and i said i don 't know i know what happens in and so i 've spent the last three years on this and there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another that psychologists can tell you and we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background the same general level of intelligence of good looks the same religious values your childhood certainly plays a role but nobody knows how and that 's about it that 's all they know no they 've never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship and i have concocted a questionnaire to serotonin estrogen and testosterone i think we 've evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain and on this dating site that i have created called chemistry com i ask you first and three point seven million people have taken the questionnaire in america about six hundred thousand people have taken it in putting the data together now and at some point but i think i will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background your same general level of intelligence good looks and you don 't feel pulled towards all of them i think there 's biology to that so i will close with this these are my older people faulkner said the past is not dead it 's not even past indeed we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain and so there 's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature and this reminds me of it these are two women women tend to get intimacy differently than men do women get intimacy from face to face talking we swivel towards each other educating it with words as soon as one guy looks up the other guy will look away i think it comes from millions of years i think for millions of years men faced their enemies they sat our challenge is to understand each other thank you"
