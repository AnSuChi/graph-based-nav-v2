  "transcript": "i spent the rest of my life searching for it and in all the wrong places what i experienced wasn 't it was music and this is where the story listening to the beatles ' white album and the look on my face is the feeling that i 've been searching for it deepens every right piece of music at the right time fuses with us on a cellular level when i hear that one song from that one summer i 'm instantly transported back there again hey i thought i could make the feelings so i got into directing music videos this is what they looked like sorry about this jeff in both i 'm searching for the same thing though to capture but never quite equated the power that just raw music had for me on its own this is not a great thing to realize when you 've devoted your life and professional career to becoming a music video director i kept asking myself did i take the wrong path so aaron koblin and i began auditioning new technologies that could put more of you inside of the johnny cash project and your interactive dreams in three dreams of black we were pushing beyond the screen trying to connect more deeply it still didn 't have the raw experiential power of pure music so i started chasing a new technology that i only had read about in science fiction nonny de la pea in mark bolas 's lab in usc it was called virtual reality this was it five years ago when i ran into it this is what it looks like and through that process we realized something in fact it 's going to be the last one i mean this because it 's the first medium that actually makes the jump from our internalization of an author 's expression of an experience to our experiencing it firsthand you look confused i 'll explain don 't worry it starts around a with a good story our clan leader is telling us about how he hunted the woolly mammoth on the tundra that day we hear his words and translate them into our own internal truths the same thing happens when we look the book about the mammoth hunt the play television show or the movie all of these mediums require what we call suspension of disbelief because there 's a translation gap between the reality of the story and our consciousness interpreting the story into our reality i 'm using the word consciousness as a feeling of reality that we get from our senses experiencing the world around us bridges that gap now you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader or you or maybe you 're even the woolly mammoth in all other mediums in vr your consciousness is the medium but where are we now well we this is the lumire brothers film that allegedly sent a theater full of people running for their lives as they thought a train was coming toward them in vr we also have to move past the spectacle in vr today we 're more learning grammar made fifteen films in the last year at our vr company vrse and we 've learned a few things we so let me show you some things for the purpose of this demo we 're going to take every direction that you could possibly look and stretch it into this giant rectangle we found if you move the camera at a constant speed in a straight line you can actually get away with it though the first day in film school they told me you have to learn every single rule before you can break one we have in this shot here where we 're moving up off the ground i added acceleration i did that because in vr i can give that to you it guides us how to feel in this project we made with the new york times zach richter and our friend jr we take and even though you 're flying two thousand feet above manhattan you don 't feel afraid you feel triumphant for jr 's character the music guides you to popular belief there is composition but it 's completely different than in film where you have a rectangular frame composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you in this film waves of grace which was a collaboration we also see the changing role of the close up in virtual reality a close up in vr means you 're actually close up to someone and you feel an emotional closeness to the character because of what you feel to be a physical closeness vr is not like it 's more of a choreography of the viewer 's attention one tool we can use to guide your attention is called spatialized sound i can put a sound anywhere and when you turn your head the sound will rotate i can use that to direct your attention to where i want you to see next time you hear someone singing over your shoulder it might be bono vr makes us feel like we are part of something we lived in small family units we started in caves then moved to clans and tribes then villages and towns and now we but i believe that we are still hardwired to care the most about the things that are local to us and vr makes anywhere and anyone and instead of watching a story about people over there it 's now a story about us here but the tricky thing is that with all previous mediums the format is fixed at its birth but vr as a format as a medium 's not using physical celluloid or paper or tv signals it actually employs what we use to make sense of the world we 're using your senses as the paints on the canvas but only eventually we can see if we will have all of our human senses employed and we call it virtual reality right now but what happens when we move past simulated realities i could let you live inside that dream what if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on earth you could surf gravitational waves on the edge of a black hole or create galaxies or communicate with each other not using words but using our raw thoughts that 's not a virtual reality anymore and honestly i don 't know what that 's called i 'm saying let 's experience it in your hands you hopefully hold a piece of cardboard let 's open the flap tap on the power button to unlock the phone and even get a google cardboard of your own to try it with i 'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning you 're about to participate in the largest collective vr and in that classic old timey style of yesteryear we 're all going to watch something at the exact same time on the please bring peace to the many who have lost loved the i believe that everyone on earth needs to experience what you just experienced that way we can collectively start to shape this not as a tech platform in november of last but a funny thing happened that sunday morning a lot of people got them that were not the intended recipients on the mailing label and we started seeing this all over instagram look familiar music led me on a path of searching for what seemed like the unattainable millions of kids just had the same formative experience in their childhood that i had in mine only i think this"
