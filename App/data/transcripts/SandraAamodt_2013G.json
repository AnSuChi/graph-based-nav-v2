  "transcript": "i made one of the best decisions of my life now i eat whenever i 'm hungry this was me and i think you did not need a diet you needed a fashion consult but i thought i needed to lose weight and when i gained it back of course i blamed myself for the next i 'm sure many of you know the feeling why is this so hard how much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you burn what most people don 't realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain mostly without your awareness and that is a good thing because your conscious mind how do we put this politely it 's good that you don 't have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie you don 't forget how to walk because you 're thinking about what to have for dinner no matter what you consciously believe but that 's a misleading term because it 's actually a range of about ten or fifteen pounds you can the part of the brain that regulates body weight there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger activity and metabolism to keep your weight stable as conditions change that 's what a thermostat does right it keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside but that 's not going to change which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal if you lose a lot of weight your brain reacts as if you were starving whether you started out fat or thin your brain 's response is exactly the same we would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not but it can 't if you do lose a lot of weight you become hungry and your muscles burn less energy dr rudy leibel of columbia university has found that people who have lost ten percent of their body weight burn two hundred and fifty to four hundred calories less because their metabolism is suppressed that 's a lot of food our ancestors ' survival and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating this may explain but they rarely go down now if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair this is the kind of thing she was talking about even after you 've kept the weight off for as long as seven years your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back if that weight loss had been due to a long famine that would be sensible response in our modern world of drive thru burgers it 's not working out so well for many of us that difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that dr yoni freedhoff of the university of ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available and it 's also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution sadly a temporary weight gain can become permanent if your brain may decide that that 's the new normal classify eaters into two groups those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower like most dieters the interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight and they spend less time thinking about food controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising super sizing and the all you can eat buffet and a small indulgence like eating one scoop of ice cream is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters several long term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years even if they started at a normal weight and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain those of you who are parents was being teased by family members about their weight so don 't do that but i couldn 't resist throwing in just this one because i 'm a geek and that 's how i roll this is a study that looked at the risk of death over a 14 year period and those zero one adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range for obese people with no healthy but a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits you can see that weight makes very little difference you can take control of your health by taking control of your even if you can 't lose weight and keep it off five years after a diet most people have regained the weight forty percent of them have gained even more if you think about this the typical outcome of dieting if i 've convinced you that dieting might be a problem the next question is what do you do about i 'm talking about mindful eating learning to understand your body 's signals so that you eat when you 're hungry and stop when you 're full because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you 're not hungry give yourself permission to eat as much as you want and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good sit down to regular meals but it 's really been worth it i it 's like aliens have taken over my brain it 's just completely different i should say that this approach to eating probably won 't make you lose weight unless you often eat when you 're not hungry don 't know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight gain instead of if diets worked we 'd all but they actually do a lot of collateral damage at worst they ruin lives weight obsession leads to eating disorders especially in young kids in the u s we have eighty percent even at its best dieting is a waste of time and energy it takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework and because willpower is limited any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you let me leave you with one last thought what if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it and as adults many of them would probably be thinner i wish someone had told me that back when i was thirteen"
