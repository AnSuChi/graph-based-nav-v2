  "transcript": "i am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves but first i want to tell you why i 'm here i 'm here for two reasons these two guys are my two sons ford and wren when ford was about three years old we shared a very small room together in a very small space if you 're a writer that and without any previous building experience and about three thousand dollars and some recycled materials i built this space as i was building this space i thought to myself surely i 'm not the only guy to have to superman had the so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now here is one of the first spaces i found it is in austin texas which is where i 'm from on the outside it looks like a very typical garage a nice garage but on the inside it 's anything but the leg lamp which is very i soon realized that manspaces didn 't have to be only inside this guy built a bowling alley in his backyard here 's another outdoor space a little bit more sophisticated this a one thousand nine hundred so pretty early on in my investigations i realized what i was finding was not what i expected to find which was quite frankly a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat screen there were definitely hang out spots but some were for working some were for playing take this place for example on the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage this is in long island new york the only thing that might tip you off is the round window on the inside it 's a recreation of a and he hired a japanese carpenter it has no nails or screws all the joints are hand carved and hand scribed here is another pretty typical scene this is a suburban las vegas neighborhood but you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional size boxing ring inside and so there is a good reason for this it was built by this man who is wayne mccullough he won the silver medal for ireland in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety two olympics so as i came to the end of my journey i found over fifty spaces and they were unexpected and they were surprising but they were also i was really impressed by how personalized they were and how much work went into them and so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do and who they were"
