  "transcript": "i thought i 'd talk a little bit about how nature makes materials i brought along with me an abalone shell this abalone shell is a biocomposite material that 's ninety eight percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass it 's three thousand times tougher than its geological counterpart and a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells like chalk i 've been fascinated by how nature makes materials and there 's a lot of secrets to how they do such an exquisite job part of it is that these materials are are macroscopic in structure they 're formed at the nano scale and they use something i think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non living structures like batteries and like solar cells what if they had some of the same capabilities so that 's kind of the vision that and so going back to this abalone shell besides being nanostructured one thing that 's fascinating is when a male and female they pass on the genetic information that says this is how to build an exquisite every time the diatoms replicate i like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old but anyone who 's who 's ever had or knows small children knows they 're incredibly complex organisms if you wanted to convince them to do something they don 't want to do it 's very difficult so when we think about future technologies we actually think of using bacteria and viruses simple organisms can you convince them to work with a new toolbox so they can build a structure that will be important to me also when we think about future technologies we start with the beginning of of earth basically it took a billion years to have have life on earth and very rapidly but it wasn 't until about five hundred million years ago during the cambrian geologic time period that organisms in the ocean started making and organisms learned how to make hard materials now if you look at at biology there 's many structures like dna antibodies proteins and ribosomes you 've heard about what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us natural biological materials the abalone shell here if you fracture it you can look at the fact that it 's nanostructured there 's diatoms made out of sio2 and there are magnetotactic bacteria that make small going back to the abalone shell the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins these proteins are very negatively charged can pull calcium out of the environment and put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate calcium and carbonate it has the chemical sequences of amino acids which says this is how to build the structure and find its corresponding but not build an abalone shell build something that i absolutely love the periodic table every year for the incoming freshman class at mit i have a periodic table made that says welcome to mit now you 're in your element laughter and you flip it over and it 's the amino acids with the with the ph at which they have different charges and so i give this out to thousands of people and i know it says mit and this is caltech but i have a couple extra if people want it i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit and i really wanted to give him a periodic table so i stayed up at night and talked to my husband how do i give president obama a periodic table what if he says ' oh i already have one ' or ' i 've already memorized it ' so he came to visit my in case you 're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight it out and said and people at mit they give out periodic tables but it took them about fifty million years to get good at it fifty million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell and that 's a hard sell to a graduate student i have this great project a nontoxic virus called m13 bacteriophage whose job is to infect bacteria well it has a simple dna structure that you can go in and and cut and paste additional dna sequences into it and by doing that it allows the virus to express random protein sequences this is pretty easy biotechnology and you could basically do this a billion times have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical but they differ from each other based on their their tips on one sequence and through a process of selection evolution you can pull one of a billion that does something you 'd like it to do like grow a battery or a solar cell basically viruses can 't replicate themselves they need a host once you find that one out of a billion the other thing that 's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries now battery that we grew in my lab we engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube the other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode and so through a process of selection evolution we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a battery that 's all made at room temperature basically at the benchtop that battery went to the white house house for a press conference and i brought it here you can see it in this case that 's lighting this led now if we could scale this you could actually use it to to run your prius which is kind of my dream to be able to drive a virus powered car basically you can you can pull one out of a billion and make lots of amplifications to it basically you make an amplification in the lab and then you get it to self assemble into a structure like a battery we 're able to do this also with catalysis and what we 've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye absorbing molecules and line them up and you get an energy transfer across the virus and then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for for clean fuels i brought an example of that with me today my students promised me it would work these are when you shine light on them you can see them bubbling in this case you 're seeing oxygen bubbles come out by controlling the genes you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance the last example are solar cells you can also do this with solar cells we 've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them and use it as a and what we 've found is through genetic engineering we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to numbers for these types of of dye sensitized systems and i brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward so this is a virus based solar cell through evolution and selection we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an eleven percent efficiency solar cell so i hope that i 've convinced you that that there 's a lot of great interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials and about taking it the next step to see if you can you can force or take advantage of how nature makes materials to make things that that nature hasn 't yet dreamed of making thank you"
