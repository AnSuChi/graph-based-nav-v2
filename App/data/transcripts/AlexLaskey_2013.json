  "transcript": "how many of you have checked your email today come on raise your hands how many of you are checking it right now investment account this week last week a but the rest of us this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this and even we aren 't paying attention to the energy use that 's driving climate change and she is decidedly not an energy geek this is the story of how harriet came to pay attention and there 's enough energy in this coal but unfortunately between here and here most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat in fact only ten percent ends up as light so this coal will last a little bit more than a month if you wanted to light this bulb for a year you 'd need this much coal we waste nine we save the other nine so the question is how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we 're using and start wasting less of it and only ninety miles from here one quarter of the homes received a message that said did you know you could save fifty four dollars a month this summer and still a third group got a message about being good citizens preventing blackouts most people guessed that money saving message would work best of all none of these messages worked they had zero impact on energy consumption it was as if the grad students hadn 't shown up at and this message simply said when surveyed seventy seven percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans please join them turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans and wouldn 't you know it they did the people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing so what does this tell us well if something is inconvenient and harnessed correctly it can be a powerful force for good in fact it already is we built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy we deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar sized homes and for the last five years we 've been running the largest behavioral and we 're just getting started this year alone in partnership with more than eighty utilities in six countries we 're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings and two terawatt hours in terms of coal we 'd need to burn thirty four of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity but we 're just one company and this is just scratching the surface and when i say wasted i don 't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs they may and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody 's home that 's forty billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well being but does contribute to climate change that 's forty billion with a b that 's half our coal usage right there some of the world 's best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these this is both fantastic and essential and we can harness this resource with no new material science we know it works and it will save us money right away so what are we waiting for well in most places utility regulation hasn 't changed much since thomas edison take a look at the prius it 's efficient not only because toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science and she was tickled to learn that my daughter 's name is also harriet she asked me what i did for a living and i told her i work with utilities to help people save energy it was then that her eyes lit up and she said you 're exactly the person i need to talk to you see two weeks ago my husband and i got a letter in the mail from our utility it told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors and still i know there must be more now i 'm here with a genuine expert tell me what should i do to save energy there are many experts who can help answer harriet 's question my goal is to make sure we are all asking it thank you"
