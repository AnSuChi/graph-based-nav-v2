  "transcript": "a few words about how i got started when i was a very young child i was extremely introverted and very much to myself and kind of as a way of surviving i would go into my own very personal i would make things for people as a way of you know giving showing them my my love i would go into these private places and i would put my ideas and my passions into objects and sort of learning how to speak with my hands so the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with and the the ideas are are very disparate i 'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces and there 's no real connection between one or the other except that they sort of come out of my brain and they 're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by by looking at life and seeing nature and seeing objects and just having having kind of playful random thoughts about things when i was a child i started to explore so i started to explore motion by and this is one that i did probably like when i was around seventh grade and the pathway and how the on my mind i was thinking about the the trajectory of the vehicles and of course when you 're a little kid so that was how i i first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it now when i went to so i sort of liked the the logical flow of events i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon because it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way so i started taking art courses and i found a way to make sculpture that that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system was both this kind of machine is as close as i can get to painting and it 's full of many little trivial end points like there 's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn 't really mean anything it 's really just just for the sort of joy of its own triviality the connection i have with engineering is the same as in that i love to solve problems i love to figure things out but the end result of what i 'm doing is really completely ambiguous that 's pretty ambiguous the next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex i gave myself the problem since i 'm always liking to solve problems i gave myself the problem of turning a crank and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth but i did have a sense of the gesture and and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point and that 's a little found object so a lot of the pieces that i 've made they involve found objects like doing visual puns all the time when i see objects i imagine them in motion i imagine what can be said with them this next one here machine with wishbone it came about from from playing with this wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with your food but i always play with things it 's kind of like a cowboy who 's been on his horse for too long and i started to make him walk across the table and i thought oh i can make a little machine that will do that so i made this device linked it up and the wishbone walks and because the wishbone it 's sort of a point where i think we we can enter into it and that 's the whole piece that 's about that big this kind of work is also very much like puppetry and it 's a little piece cory 's yellow chair and i saw it explode up and out and so the way i saw this in my mind at first was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed and the pieces would move and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel and they would coalesce for just a moment so you could you could perceive that there was a chair there for me it 's kind of a feeling the machine is in this case it 's a real approximation of that because obviously you can 't move physical matter this whole thing is about four feet wide and the chair itself is only about a few inches now this is a funny sort of conceptual and yesterday we were talking about danny hillis ' and it goes through a gear train there are twelve pairs of fifty one reductions so i 've invented it in concrete because it doesn 't really matter because it could run all the time i 'm always imagining myself in different situations i 'm imagining myself as a machine what would i love i would love to be bathed in oil so this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in it 's really just sort of for me it was just really about the lusciousness of oil and then i got a call from a friend and i didn 't have any pieces but when she suggested to be in the show this piece came to mind so it 's sort of related but you can see it 's much more overtly erotic and this one i call machine with grease it 's just continually ejaculating and it 's this is a happy machine i 'll tell you it 's definitely happy this is just a and then again this is a found object a little fan that i that i found and i thought what about the gesture of opening the fan and how how simply could i state something and in a case like this i 'm trying to make something which which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or is very important because i 'm inventing machines but i 'm also inventing tools to make machines and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly sort of developing my own little world of technology my life completely changed when i found a spot welder it completely changed what i could do this is not the way they teach you to silver solder i just like throw it in i mean real jewelers put little bits of solder in i joined a group called the world sculpture racing society and and there 'd be no subjective decision about what was the best it would be whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner and i 'm going to have it i 'm going to have my hand writing ' faster ' so as i run down the street the cart 's going to talk to me and it 's going to go in the end what i decided was every time you finish writing the word i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road so i would never win the race because i 'm always stopping but i had a lot of fun now i only have two and half minutes i 'm going to play this this this is a piece that for me is i was imagining that i would make the curtain would open and you 'd be entertained so i imagined a very simple gestural dance that that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair and when i 'm making these pieces i 'm always trying to find where i 'm saying something very clearly and it but also at the same time it 's very ambiguous and i think there 's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it and that leads me to the thought that and i do my best at at but somehow i manage to sort of get this thought and someone brings it into their own mind then there 's a cycle that has been completed and to me that 's the most important thing because and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside out to the physical to someone perceiving it so i 'll just let this chair come down the"
