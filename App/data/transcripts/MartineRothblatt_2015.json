  "transcript": "i guess what we 're going to do is we 're going to okay now who is this he was about age five this is taken in nigeria right after having taken the washington d c bar exam ca okay but this doesn 't really look like a martine mr right that was myself as a male the way i was brought up before i transitioned from male to female and martin to martine ca you were brought up martin rothblatt mr correct ca and about a year after this picture you married a beautiful woman was this love at first sight what happened there mr it was love at the first sight i saw bina and we later began living together but the moment i saw her i saw just an aura of energy around her i asked her to i was a single male parent she was a single female parent and we 've been happily married for a third of a century now companies and then you started addressing this problem of how could you so it was exciting for me to be part of the navigation and as i developed different the consequence of which was that the receiving antennas could be smaller and smaller and after going through direct television broadcasting i had the idea that if we could make a more powerful the receiving dish could be so small that it would just be a section of a parabolic dish a flat little plate and that 's sirius xm today ca wow so who here has used sirius mr thank you for your monthly subscriptions but soon after this in the early there was this big transition in your life and you became martine i discussed with each of them that i felt but i was afraid people would laugh at me if i expressed it so i always kept it bottled up and just showed my male side and each of them had a different take on this i love your soul and whether the outside is martin and martine it doesn 't it matter to me i love your soul my son said if you become a woman will you still be my father and i said yes i 'll always be your father and i 'm still his father today my youngest daughter did an brilliant five year old thing she told people i love my dad and she loves me so she had no problem with a gender blending whatsoever ca you published this book the apartheid of sex what was your thesis in this book mr my thesis in this book is that there are seven billion people in the world and actually seven billion unique ways to express one 's gender and while people may have the genitals of a male or a female the genitals don 't determine your gender or even really your sexual identity that 's just a matter of anatomy and reproductive tracts we know from anthropological science that race is fiction the reality is a gender fluidity that crosses the entire continuum from male to female ca you yourself don 't always feel one hundred percent female mr i would say in some ways i change my gender about as often as i change my hairstyle ca now this is your gorgeous daughter jenesis she was finding herself unable to walk up the stairs in our house to her bedroom almost invariably fatal disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension ca so how did you respond to that we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could we ended up at children 's national medical center in washington d c the head of pediatric cardiology he said that all people with this illness died and if any of you have seen the film lorenzo 's oil scene when the protagonist kind of rolls down the stairway crying and and bemoaning the fate of his son and that 's exactly how we felt about jenesis ca but you didn 't accept that as the limit of what you could do you started trying to research and see if you could find a cure somehow mr correct she was in the intensive care ward for weeks at a time even in college so i had to go from a biology textbook and eventually i knew enough to think that it might be possible that somebody could find a cure so we started a nonprofit foundation i wrote a description asking people to submit grants and we would pay for medical research i became an we really appreciate all the funding you 've provided us but however there is a medicine that was developed at but burroughs wellcome has just been acquired by glaxo wellcome they made a decision not to develop any medicines for rare and orphan diseases and maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications to develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension ca so how on earth did you get access to this drug mr i went to glaxo wellcome and after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face because they weren 't going to out license the drug to a satellite communications expert and they thought i didn 't have the expertise finally i wore down their resistance and and they tried to tell me you 're just wasting your time we 're sorry about your daughter but finally for twenty five thousand dollars and agreement to pay ten percent of any revenues we might ever get they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug ca and so you put this drug on the market way by basically charging what it would take to make the economics work mr oh yes chris but this really wasn 't a drug that i ended up there 's no medicine for jenesis this is just something we tried in rats and they gave me like a little plastic ziploc bag of a small amount of powder they said don 't give it to any human and they gave me a piece of paper which said it was a patent and from that we had to figure out a way to make this medicine a hundred chemists in the u s at the top universities all swore that little patent could never be turned into a medicine if it was turned into a you were there with a medicine that worked for jenesis mr chris the astonishing thing is that this absolutely worthless piece of powder that had the sparkle of a promise of hope for jenesis is not only keeping jenesis and other people alive today produces almost a billion and a half dollars a year in revenue dollars last year one hundred million dollars it 's the best return on investment they ever received and believe me if you grew up your whole life with people in your face saying that you 've got a fatal disease i would probably run to tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again but instead she chooses to work in united therapeutics she says she wants to do all she can to help other people with orphan diseases get medicines she 's our project leader for all telepresence activities where she helps digitally unite the entire company to work together to find cures for pulmonary hypertension ca there are still many people dying and you are tackling that too how mr exactly chris there 's some three thousand people a year in the united states alone perhaps ten times that number worldwide who continue to die of this illness because the medicines slow down the progression but they don 't halt it but sadly there are only enough available lungs for two thousand whereas nearly a half million people a year die of end stage lung failure ca so how can you address that mr so i conceptualize the possibility that just like we keep cars and planes and buildings going forever with an unlimited supply of building parts and machine parts why can 't we create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs to keep people living and the company he founded with peter diamandis the founder of the x prize so that the pig 's organs will not be rejected by the human body and thereby to create an unlimited supply supply of transplantable organs we do this through our company united therapeutics ca through these guys mr absolutely chris i 'm as certain of that as i was of the success that we 've had with direct television it 's actually not rocket science it 's straightforward engineering away one gene after another we 're so lucky to be born in the time that sequencing genomes is a routine activity and the brilliant folks at synthetic genomics are able to zero in on the pig genome find exactly the genes that are problematic and fix them ca and i think this graph for what does this mean mr what this graph means and it comes from ray kurzweil is that the rate of development in computer processing firmware and software has been advancing along a curve such that by the 2020s as we saw in earlier presentations today there will be information technology that processes information and the world around us at the same rate as a human mind ca and so that being so you 're actually getting ready for this world by believing beliefs attitudes and and once software is able to recapitulate consciousness be able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file ca now you 're not just messing around with this you there 's the centerfold from national geographic magazine with one of her caregivers and she roams the web and has hundreds of hours of bina 's mannerisms but but other times as compelling as those of any flesh person she 's interviewed ca part of your hope here is that this version of bina can in a sense live on forever some future upgrade to this version can live on forever mr yes not just bina but everybody you know it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files and as apps become available that will allow us to billions of people will be able to develop mind clones of themselves that will have their own life on the web ca so the thing is martine that in any normal conversation this would sound but in the context of your you wouldn 't bet against it mr well i think it 's really nothing coming from me if anything i 'm perhaps a bit of a india the there are tens of millions of people working on writing code that expresses more and more aspects of our human consciousness and you don 't have to be and it 's something we 'll value there are so many things to do in this life and if we could have a simulacrum of ourselves that helps us process books do shopping i believe our mind clones these digital versions of ourselves will ultimately be our best friends and for me personally and bina personally and so for us the prospect of mind clones and regenerated bodies is that our love affair chris can go on forever and we never get bored of each other i 'm sure we never will ca i think bina 's here right when you got married if someone had told you that the man you were marrying would become a woman and a few years after that you would become a robot laughter how has this gone how has it been bina rothblatt it 's been really but we started making goals and setting those goals and accomplishing things and before you knew it we just keep going up and up and we 're still not stopping so it 's great ca martine told me something really beautiful just actually on skype before this which was that he wanted to live for hundreds of years we want to wake up together ca so just so as you know from my point of view this isn 't only one of the most astonishing lives i have heard it 's one of the most astonishing love stories i 've ever heard it 's just a delight to have you both here at ted"
