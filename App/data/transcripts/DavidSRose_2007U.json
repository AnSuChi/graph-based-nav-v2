  "transcript": "and by the use of pitching powerpoints to vcs i have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from vcs so i think it 's safe to say i know a little bit about the process of pitching so the very first question you 've got to figure out is what is the single most important thing that a vc is looking for when you come to them pitching your new business idea what is the single most important thing the vc is going to be investing in somebody what audience people david rose people you that 's it you are the person therefore the entire purpose of a vc pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return you can 't just walk up and say i 'm a really good guy good girl and you should invest in me right so in that eighteen or ten or five minutes you have to what 's the single most important thing you 've got to convey what audience integrity dr boy oh boy oh boy that 's a straight line look at that what 's the second most important thing can get this one audience self confidence close enough passion right entrepreneurs by definition are people who are leaving something else starting a new world creating and putting their lifeblood into this thing or put money into your company if you 're not passionate then there 's a whole panoply of other things you 've got to wrap up in this package you 're presenting to a vc i 've done this before done this before is starting an enterprise creating value and taking something from beginning to end that 's why which puts you in good stead with the experience of starting an enterprise or running something doesn 't have to be a business it can be an organization in a school a not for profit but experience in creating an organization next knowledge if you tell me you i want you to have expertise that it takes to get a company going those skills include everything from technical skills if it 's a technology business to marketing and sales and management and so on but well leadership you 've got to be able to convince us and you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to to get people to follow your lead to inspire them to motivate them to be part of your team i want to know that you have commitment that i want you to say or i want you to convey that you are going to die if you have to with your very last breath your fingernails scratching as they draw you alive and make more from it i don 't want someone who 'll cut and run at the first opportunity bad things happen there 's never been a but on top of that i need realism i need to know you have the ability to listen and they 'd like to know that you want to hear that experience so how do you convey these ten things in ten minutes without saying you walk in the door they know nothing whatsoever about you you can take them on an emotional all pitches all sales presentations are emotional at some level you can go up you can go down right and it goes from beginning the overall arc of your presentation it 's got to start like a rocket you 've got maybe ten seconds between ten and thirty seconds depending on how long the pitch is to get their attention in i 've invested i 've gotten millions of dollars from powerpoint pitches i 've invested millions that should get you right there this can be a fact or something counterintuitive then first logical progression any time you go backwards any time you skip a step imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing or the the heights are different you stop you of or basic items in your business i want to know about things that i can relate to it can be people have done it before it can be your beta tests are going great whatever i want but that somebody or something else out there says this makes sense and then i 'm looking for the upside i need a believable upside that 's two parts it 's got to be upside and believable the upside means if you tell me that five years out you 're making a million dollars a year so it 's got to be you have to recover from those for example anything that i know is not true we have no competition i discount half of what you 're saying from then from then on anything i don 't understand where i have to make the leap myself in my own head will stop the flow of the presentation so you 've got to take me through like a sixth grader dub dub dub but without patronizing me and it 's a very tricky path but if you can do it it works really really well anything that inconsistent within anything that 's an error or a typo or a stupid mistake or a line that 's in the wrong place that shows me that if you can 't do a presentation how can you run a company so this this all feeds feeds in together the best way to do this is to look at our betters people who have done this before let 's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes here 's gates doing a thing for for windows is this how to do a powerpoint presentation what do you think no who do you think we should look at as our role model this is the zen of presentation what are you focusing on you 're focusing on him this is steve jobs so are these wonderful long bullet points whole list of things good no they 're not the long bullet points are bad what 's good bullet points does steve jobs use basically none what do you do best of all images just a simple image i look at the image a picture 's worth a thousand words you look at the image and you 've got the whole thing then you come back to me you 're focused on me why i 'm such a great guy why you want to invest why this all makes sense just give me your company logo i look at the logo and it ties it to my brain then i come back to you i 'm focused on you you ok you give me your quick then you give me a quick business overview this is then you 've got to walk me through show me who your management team is show me a screenshot of your website don 't whatever it is now that i know what you 're selling tell me how you make money on it for every x you sell you get y i want to know who you 're selling to in terms of customers and if you have any special relationships that will help you whether it way of doing something i want to know exactly what your competition is and that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation i want to know how you 're special i know what your competition does how are you going to prevent them from eating your lunch and i want to know four or five years forward five is a bit much probably four i want to know what the driver is we 'll have one thousand customers this year and ten thousand the next our revenues will do this and that that gives me the whole picture for the next several years into which i 'm investing and i want to know how the money from me will help you get there you 're going to but then comes the ask where you tell me how much you want you 're looking for five million at what valuation two million one hundred thousand i hope you invested what 's the capital structure up until this point finally having done all that you 've now told to give me the final boom the final pitch that 's going to send me into space now in the process how do you remember the sequences and do it you 've noticed i 'm not looking at the screen right well i have a laptop in front of me so i can see what 's going powerpoint has this built into every copy of it that 's shipped if you use apple 's keynote it 's got an even better version there 's another program called ovation which helps you run the timers and lets you figure out what 's going on number five always use presenter mode or ovation or but not good as a handout you want a handout that gives more information don 't read your speech can you imagine"
