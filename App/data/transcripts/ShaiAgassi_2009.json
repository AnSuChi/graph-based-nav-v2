  "transcript": "that 's the question that and i started playing with it more like original thought i had this must be ethanol so i went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the amazon in your backyard in every country until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car if you use hydrogen so that is not going to be the path to go and then sort of through a process of wandering around i got to the thought that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is convenient and affordable you could ninety nine percent of the population the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good good as any car that you would have today so one it has to be more convenient than a car and two it has be more affordable than today 's cars affordable is not a forty thousand dollar sedan so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that that i started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show up how do you do it within the economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down the car ownership and the battery ownership in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic batteries not included now if you separate between the two you could actually answer the need for a convenient car by creating a network by creating a network before the cars show up the network has two components in them first component is you charge the car whenever you stop ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about twenty two hours and so the first thought that came to mind is everywhere we park we have electric power now it sounds crazy but in some places around in a sense is the first step of the infrastructure the second step of the infrastructure needs to take care of the range extension see we 're bound by today 's technology on batteries which is about one hundred and twenty miles if you want to stay within reasonable so what we added is a second element to our network which is a battery swap system you come into your and a plate comes up holds your battery takes it out puts it back in and within two minutes you 're back on the road and you can go again and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it and it ends up we said that if you stop to swap your battery more than fifty times a year we start paying you money because it 's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability we looked at the question what you have the crude oil and you have refining and delivery of that crude oil as what we call petrol or gasoline the battery and so it 's sort of a mini well we were asked in the past when we bought an electric car to pay for the entire well for the life of the car wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car in a sense what we 've done is we 've created a new consumable you today buy gasoline miles and we created electric miles and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number it is eight cents a mile have a hard time calculating what that means in the average consumer environment we 're in in the u s twenty miles per gallon that 's a buck fifty a buck sixty a gallon that 's cheaper than today 's gasoline even in the u s but e miles follow moore 's law they go from eight cents a mile four cents a mile in two thousand and fifteen to two cents a mile by two thousand and twenty why because batteries life cycle improve a bit of improvement on energy density which reduces the price and these prices are actually with clean electrons we do not use any electrons that come from coal so in a sense this is an absolute that is an eighty cent gallon an that 's a new economic factor which is fascinating to most people now this would have been a wonderful paper that 's how i solved it in my head it was a white paper i handed out to governments and some governments told me that it 's fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things and he ran a beautiful manipulation and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume in two million cars that 's what we needed in israel i 'll give you country to invest the two hundred million into peres thought that was a great idea so we went out and we we looked at all the car companies we sent letters to all the car companies three of them never showed up one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount but one of them carlos ghosn ceo of renault and nissan when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating he said hybrids are like mermaids when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish and ghosn came up and said i have the car mr peres i will build you the cars and actually true to form renault has put a billion and a half dollars in building nine different types of cars cars that fit this kind of model that will come into the market in mass volume mass volume being the first year one hundred thousand cars it 's the first mass volume electric car zero emission electric car in the market i was running as chris said to be the ceo of a large software company called sap and then peres said well won 't you run this project no no no no you 've got to explain to me what is more important than saving your country and saving the world that you would go and do and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a and denmark set this beautiful policy it 's called the iq test it 's inversely proportional to taxes they put one hundred and eighty percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on if you fail the iq test they ask you to leave the country we then were sort of coined as the guys who run only in small islands i know most people don 't think of israel as a small island but israel is an island it 's a the third country we announced was australia it 's got three centers in brisbane in melbourne in sydney and one freeway one electric freeway that connects them the next island was not too hard to find and that was hawaii we decided to come into the u s and pick the two best places the one where you didn 't need any range extension hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island the second one was the san francisco bay area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors he decided that he 's going to take over the state unofficially and then officially and then created this beautiful region one policy in the san francisco bay area not only do you have the highest concentration of priuses but you also have the perfect range extender it 's called the other car as we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u s why is this a big issue and the most fascinating thing we 've learned of oil much like lots of other curves that we 've seen goes along a depletion curve the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground and we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out here is the problem at one hundred and forty seven dollars a barrel which we were in six months ago the u s spent a ton of money to get somewhere in that space what happens when the economy recovers that is another twenty five million barrels a day that 's all the u s usage it 's going to go up and problems that are depletive in now we actually looked at what the answer would be right remember in the campaign one million hybrid that is zero point five percent of the u s oil consumption that is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world that won 't do much difference we looked at an mit study ten million electric cars on the global roads ten million out of five hundred million we will add between now and then that is the most pessimistic number you can have it 's also the most optimistic number because it means we will scale this industry from one hundred thousand cars is two thousand and eleven to ten million cars by two thousand and sixteen one hundred x growth you have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars we have ten million cars by region that 's an enormous amount of cars adding those cars india the indians don 't even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time for them to get a battery that goes one hundred and twenty miles is an extension on range not a reduction in range we 're the only ones who don 't have the price set right we don 't have the industry set right we don 't have any incentive to go and resolve it across the u s now where is the car industry on that very interesting the car industry has been focused just on themselves they basically looked at it and said miles if you want but our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars you 're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills in denmark we will drive all the cars in denmark in israel we 've asked to put a solar farm in the south of israel and people said oh that 's a very very large space that you 're asking for and we said what if we had proven that in the same space we found oil for the country for the next hundred years and they said we tried there isn 't any these are perfect matches now all you need is about ten percent of the electricity generated now when we 're looking at solving big problems we need to start thinking in two numbers and those are not twenty percent by two thousand and twenty the two numbers are zero as in zero footprint or zero oil and scale it infinity and at the end of this year we can 't stop thinking of padding co2 we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale one car emits four tons and actually seven hundred and change million cars today emit two point eight billion tons of co2 that 's we have to come and attack this problem with a focus with an effort that actually says we 're going to go to zero before i actually shared that with some legislators here in the u s i shared it with i told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remembered is because he said we 're going to send a man to the moon and we 'll do it by the end of the decade we didn 't say we 're going to send a man twenty percent to the moon and there will be about a twenty percent chance we 'll recover him he actually shared with me another story which is from about two hundred years ago there was a long argument over economy versus morality twenty five percent just like twenty five percent emissions today comes from cars twenty five percent of their energy for the entire industrial world in in the u k came from a source of energy that was immoral and there was an argument and what would it do to our economy and people said well we need to take time to do it and the industrial and the u k had one hundred years of economic we have to make the right moral decision we have to make it we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in israel that said we will end oil and we need to do it not within twenty years or fifty years but within this presidential term because if we don 't we will lose our economy right after we 'd lost our morality"
