  "transcript": "and every one of us gets sick and the question really is how sick do we get is it something that kills us is it something that we survive is it something that we can and for a long time it was the gods right the gods are angry with me or the gods are testing me right and as long as we 've looked for and as long as we 've had hypotheses about why we get sick we 've tried to treat it as well so this is avicenna he wrote a book over a thousand years ago called the canon of medicine and the rules he laid out for testing medicines are actually really similar to the rules we have today that and so if you put together these themes of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing 1800s he thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing and they laughed at him for twenty years they called this guy the mosquito man but he ran an experiment in people hypothesis and he tested it in people and it definitively proved that it wasn 't this magic dust called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever and this is what those people signed up for this is what it looked like to have yellow fever in cuba at that time you suffered in a tent and it 's an informed consent document and enforced medical experimentation it 's the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn 't agreement it 's something that protects us from harm from and so you put together the thread and it 's how we do the vast majority of medical work it doesn 't really matter if you 're in the north the south the east the west clinical studies form the basis of how we but the world is changing around the clinical study which has been fairly well established for tens of years if not fifty to one hundred years so now we 're able to gather data about our genomes but as we saw earlier our genomes aren 't dispositive and more importantly we 're able to gather information about our choices because it turns out that what we think of as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies our genomes our choices so this is my grandfather i actually never met him but he 's holding my mom and his genes are in and my choices are going to affect his health the technology between these two pictures cannot be more different but the methodology for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period we just have better statistics the way we gain informed consent so the data that we collect for prostate cancer or for alzheimer 's trials goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for alzheimer 's research and this is an accident these are tools that we created to protect us from harm but what they 're doing is protecting us from innovation now and that wasn 't the goal it wasn 't the point right it 's a side effect if you will of a power we created to take us for good we cannot take the information and that sucks right so forty five percent of men develop cancer thirty eight percent of women develop cancer one in four men dies of cancer and three out of the four drugs we give you if you get and when you have it you don 't have a lot of privacy in the hospital you 're naked the vast majority of the time people you don 't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you and when i tell cancer survivors that this tool we created to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used especially when only three to four percent of people who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study is not thank you god for protecting my privacy it 's outrage so the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous fifteen hundred people a day die in the united states so a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust i like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid and we can learn a lot about health from it so if our choices are part of our health what we eat is a really important aspect of our health so you can do something very simple and basic and take a picture of your food and if enough people do that we can learn a lot about how our food affects our health one interesting thing that came out of this this is an app for iphones called the eatery is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people 's pizza is okay and it seems like a trivial result but this is the sort of research that used to take the health system years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish it was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people i don 't have any financial interest in it so that means if you told everyone you carry the apoe e4 allele what 's wrong with you right when i got these results i started talking to doctors and they told me not to tell anyone and my reaction is is that going to help anyone cure me when i get the disease and i got even more obnoxious and i have some bad liver numbers but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine the night before we ran the test but look at how non computable this information this is like the the photograph of my granddad holding my mom so the thing that i 'm proposing we do here is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype which is a commons we do it voluntarily and we do it through standardized legal tools we do it through standardized technologies right that 's all a commons is it 's something that we build together because we think it 's important and although a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control around data and obsess around privacy at least some of us really like to share as a form of control and what 's remarkable about digital commonses is you don 't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough to generate something massive and beautiful but we have the apache web server but it works so as long as some people like to share as their form of control we can build a commons as long as we can get the information out and in biology the numbers are even better so vanderbilt ran a study asking people we 'd like to take your biosamples your blood and share them in a biobank and only five percent of the people opted out i 'm from tennessee it 's not the most science positive state in the united states of america if you give them the opportunity and the choice and the reason that i got obsessed with this besides the obvious family aspects is that i spend a lot of time around mathematicians but math in this day and is like a giant set of power tools that we 're leaving on the floor not plugged in in health while we use hand saws if we have a lot of shared genotypes and a lot of shared outcomes and a lot of shared lifestyle choices and a lot of shared environmental information the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices and there 's open source infrastructure to do all of this sage bionetworks is a nonprofit that 's built a giant math system that 's waiting for data but there isn 't any so that 's what i do i 've actually started what we think is the world 's first fully digital fully global in participation ethically approved so if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust if you reach into your body and grab your genome if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record you can actually go through an online informed consent process because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed and you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research and the goal is to get one hundred thousand in the first year and a million in the first five years so that we have a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take smaller sample sizes from traditional research and map it against so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations between the variations that make us unique and i 've spent a lot of time around other commons i 've been around the early web i 've been around the early creative commons world and there 's four things that all of these share which is they 're all really simple and so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study you 're not going to see something complicated but it 's not simplistic and so being simple doesn 't mean being simplistic and being weak doesn 't mean weakness those are strengths in the system and open doesn 't mean that there 's no money and they 're one of the reasons why the open web lives is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness of the system and so all of these things are you do have to solve a captcha as well so if you don 't like those terms you don 't come in it 's very much the design principles of a commons that we 're trying to bring to health data and the other thing about these systems is that it only takes a small number of really unreasonable people working together and health care is broken so i 'd like you to actually try when you go home to get your data you 'll be shocked and offended and i would bet outraged at how hard it is maybe you won 't if you don 't have anyone in your family who 's sick maybe you wouldn be unreasonable then maybe you would and we 're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there and they 're going to return all the data to the participants of the study in a computable to load it into the study that i 've put together so we 'll know exactly how many people are willing to be unreasonable"
