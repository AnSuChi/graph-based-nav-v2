  "transcript": "unfortunately by the time that a medic actually gets to you what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more with the application of pressure to stop that type of bleed but it 's also a huge problem that 's epidemic throughout the entire medical field which is how do we actually look years is to develop before we do this we have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work so now everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells so the cell is the most basic unit of life but not many people know what else so now the ecm is actually this mesh that holds the cells in place provides structure for your tissues but it also gives the cells a home it allows them to feel what they 're doing where they are and tells them how to act and how to behave which is exactly what we 're trying to do for example think of the rainforest you have the canopy so just like that the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three dimensions you actually have to rebuild this very complex so as you see your cells sit in this complicated mesh so now every other piece of technology on the market can only manage a two dimensional approximation of plant derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound so if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me you can actually put our material onto this and just like lego and if you put it onto skin it turns into something that looks just like skin so now this has a whole bunch of applications but basically the idea is wherever you put this product you 're able to reassemble into it immediately now this is a simulated arterial bleed blood warning at twice human artery pressure so now this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic and like i said before would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop now in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself our material is able to stop that bleed and it 's because it actually goes on and works with the body to heal so it reassembles into this piece of meat and then the blood actually recognizes that that that 's happening and produces fibrin so now this technology thank you applause by january will be in the hands of veterinarians and we 're working very diligently to try to get it into the hands of hopefully within the next year and instead of bleeding out in three minutes you pull a small pack of gel out of your belt and with the press of a button you 're able to stop your own bleed and you 're on your way to recovery thank you very much"
