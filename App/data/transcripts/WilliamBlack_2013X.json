  "transcript": "today 's top chef class is in how to rob a bank and it 's clear that the general public needs guidance because the average bank robbery nets only seven thousand five hundred dollars rank amateurs who know nothing about how to cook the books the folks who know of course run our largest banks and in the last go around they cost us over eleven trillion intensifying financial crises and how we can prevent them in the future control fraud is what happens when the people who control typically a ceo a seemingly legitimate entity use it as a weapon to defraud and these are the weapons of mass destruction in the financial world because the weapon of choice in finance is accounting and there is a recipe for accounting and we discovered this recipe in quite an odd way that i 'll come back to in a moment first ingredient in the recipe second but loans that are made at a very high interest rate or yield while providing only trivial loss reserves against the inevitable losses if you follow those four simple steps and any bank can follow them then you are mathematically guaranteed to have three things occur the first thing is you will report record bank profits not just high record two the ceo will immediately be made incredibly wealthy by modern executive compensation and three the bank will suffer catastrophic losses and will fail unless it is bailed out and during the savings and loan debacle in and we discovered this recipe was common to each of these frauds the one that cost us eleven trillion dollars just in the household sector that cost us ten million jobs was the easiest financial crisis by far to have avoided and the two huge epidemics of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis appraisal fraud and liar 's loans and what we 're going to see in looking at both of these is because back in the savings and loan debacle we had figured out how to respond and prevent these crises they were obvious that what was going on was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up let 's take appraisal fraud first this is simply where you inflate the value of the home that is being pledged as security for the loan the year two thousand that is over a year before enron fails by the way the honest appraisers got together a formal petition begging the federal government to act and the industry to act to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud that banks were demanding that appraisers inflate the appraisal and that if the appraisers refused to do so they the banks would blacklist honest appraisers we 've seen this before in the savings and loan debacle and we know that this kind of fraud can only originate from the lenders and that no honest lender would ever inflate the appraisal because it 's the great protection against loss so this was an incredibly early warning two thousand well that warning actually and in the midst of fighting that wave of accounting control fraud in one thousand it began in orange county california they are making loans without even checking what the borrower 's income and we drove long beach converted to become a mortgage bank for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction and changed its name to ameriquest and became the most notorious of the liar 's loans frauds early on and to add to that they deliberately predated upon so we knew again about we 'd stopped and it was absolutely unambiguous that no honest lender would make loans in this fashion so let 's take a look thousand and six by increasing liar 's loans by over five hundred percent these were the loans that hyperinflated the bubble and produced the economic crisis by two thousand and six half of all the loans called subprime were also liar 's loans they 're not mutually exclusive it 's just that together they 're the most toxic combination you can possibly imagine and this is despite a warning from the industry 's own antifraud experts that said that these loans were nine zero and second massively increased them no government regulator ever required or encouraged any lender to make a liar 's loan or anyone to purchase a liar 's loan and that explicitly includes fannie and freddie this came from the lenders because of the fraud recipe what happened to appraisal fraud it expanded remarkably as well two thousand and seven when a survey of appraisers was done ninety percent of appraisers reported that they had been subject to coercion from the lenders and this is what drove the bubble what happened in the governmental sector the government as i told you congress it may strike you as impossible but actually did something intelligent in and passed the home the explicit statutory authority to ban liar 's loans by every so what did ben bernanke and alan greenspan as chairs of the fed do when they got these warnings that these were massively fraudulent loans once it starts out a fraudulent loan it can only be sold to the secondary market through more frauds lying about the reps and warrantees and then those people are going to produce mortgage backed securities and exotic derivatives which are also going to be supposedly backed by those fraudulent loans so the fraud is going to progress through the entire and remember we had experience with this we had seen significant losses and we had experience of competent regulators in stopping it greenspan and bernanke refused to use the authority under the statute to stop liar 's loans they 're just horrifically opposed to anything regulatory but it is the race to the bottom between the united states and the united kingdom the city of london in particular and the city of london won that race to the bottom but it meant that all regulation in the west was completely degraded in this stupid competition to be who could have the weakest regulation so that was the after ten million jobs lost a crisis in which the losses and the frauds were more than seventy times larger than the savings and loan debacle and that understates the degree of prioritization because we worked with the fbi to create the list of the top one hundred fraud schemes the absolute worst of the worst nationwide roughly six hundred senior officials we had a ninety percent conviction rate it 's the greatest success against elite and it was because of this understanding of control fraud and the accounting control the same agency office of thrift supervision which was supposed to regulate many of the largest makers of liar 's loans in the country has made even today it no longer exists but the office of the comptroller of the currency which is supposed to regulate the largest national banks has made zero criminal referrals the federal deposit insurance corporation is smart enough to refuse to answer the question without any guidance from the regulators there 's no expertise in the fbi to investigate complex and therefore we have zero and of course zero convictions of any of the elite with no expertise coming from the regulators the fbi formed what it calls a partnership with the mortgage bankers association and the mortgage bankers association set out it had the audacity in which guess what and the fbi has bought this hook line sinker rod reel and the boat they rode out in and so the african american and a president and it 's those oh so clever hairdressers who were able to defraud the poor pitiful banks who lack any financial sophistication it is the silliest story you can conceive of and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers while lions are roaming the campsite the fbi is chasing mice what do we need to do what can we do in all of this we need to change the perverse incentive structures that produce get rid of the systemically dangerous institutions these are the institutions we need to shrink them to the point within the next five years that they no longer pose a systemic risk right now they are ticking time bombs that will cause a global crisis as soon as the next one fails not if when completely reform modern executive and professional compensation which is what they use to suborn the appraisers remember they were pressuring the appraisers through the compensation system trying to produce what we call a gresham 's dynamic and they largely which is how the fraud became endemic and the third thing that we need to do is deal with what we call the three d 's deregulation and the de facto decriminalization and if we do so we can dramatically reduce how often we have a crisis and how severe those crises are that we have no meaningful reforms in any of the three areas that i 've talked about but that 's just one form of ammunition for this fraud weapon there are many forms of ammunition they can use that 's why we need to learn what the bankers have learned because our legislators thank you very much"
