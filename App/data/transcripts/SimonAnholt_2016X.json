  "transcript": "as many of you know the results of the recent election were as follows hillary clinton the democratic candidate won a landslide victory came a distant second with nineteen percent the libertarian candidate what parallel universe do you suppose i live in well i don 't live in a parallel universe so let me take you back and explain what i mean by that in june this year i launched something called the global vote anywhere in the world vote in the elections of other people 's countries now why would you do that what and then you select an election here 's a bunch that we 've already covered we do about one a month or thereabouts so you can see bulgaria referendum at the end there you select the election that you 're interested in and you pick the candidates these are the candidates from the recent presidential election in the tiny island nation of so tom and prncipe one and then you can look at the brief summary of each of those candidates which i dearly hope these were the candidates in the recent icelandic presidential election and that 's the way it goes so why on earth would you want to vote the reason that you wouldn 't want to do it let me reassure you is order to interfere in the democratic processes of another country that 's not the purpose at all in fact you can 't but more importantly i 'm not particularly interested in the domestic issues of individual countries that 's not what we 're voting on that 's something that only the americans can vote on and that 's so very important because we live as no doubt you 're sick of hearing people tell massively interdependent world where the political decisions of people in other countries can and will have an impact on our lives no matter who we are no matter where we live like the wings of the butterfly beating on one side of the pacific that can apparently create a hurricane on the other side so it is with the world that we live in today any country no matter how small even if it 's so tom and prncipe could produce the next nelson mandela or the next stalin and the system is so strange because the system hasn 't caught up with this globalized reality only a small number of people are allowed to vote for those leaders even though their impact is gigantic and almost universal what number was it one hundred and forty million americans voted for the next president of the united states and yet as all of us knows in a few weeks time somebody is going to hand over the nuclear having a potential impact on all of us i don 't know what is similarly the election for the referendum on the brexit vote a small number of millions of british people voted on that whichever way it went would have had a significant impact on the lives of what kind of democracy is that huge decisions that affect all of us being decided by relatively very small numbers of people i send them the second question i send them those questions they i reckon if you 're standing to become the so i 'm not altogether surprised that they don 't all answer but many do and some of them do much more than answer some of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way you could imagine i just want to say a word here for saviour chishimba who was one of the candidates in the recent zambian presidential election his answers to those two questions were basically an on his view of zambia 's potential role in the world and in the international community i posted it on the website so anybody could read it now saviour so i found myself wondering what am i going to do with this extraordinary group of people i 've got some wonderful people here who won the global vote we always get it wrong by the way the one that we elect is never the person who 's elected by the domestic electorate but i think it may also be a sign what 's in it for me instead of what they should be asking today which is what 's in it for we but there you go so suggestions please not right now but send me an email if you 've got an idea about what we can do with this amazing team of glorious losers laughter we 've got saviour chishimba who i mentioned before we 've got halla tmasdttir who was the runner up in the icelandic presidential election many of you may have seen her amazing we 've got maria das neves from so tom and prncipe we 've got and we covered also the election for the next secretary general of the united nations we 've got the ex prime so i think maybe those people the glorious loser 's club could travel around the world wherever there 's an election and remind people of the necessity in our modern age of thinking a little bit outwards but there are some other really important elections coming up in fact they seem to be multiplying there 's something going on i 'm sure you 've noticed in the world and the next row of elections are all critically important in just a few day 's time we 've got the rerun of the austrian presidential election with the prospect of norbert hofer becoming what is commonly described as the first far right head of state in europe since the second world war we 've got presidential elections in iran it gets more and more important clearly the global vote is not a stand alone project it 's not just there on its own it has some background it 's part of a project which i launched the idea of the good country is basically very simple it 's my simple diagnosis of what 's wrong with the world and how we can fix it what 's wrong with the world i 've already weapons proliferation all of these problems which threaten to wipe us out are by their very nature globalized problems no individual country has the capability of tackling them on its own we don 't do it nearly often enough most of the time countries still persist in behaving as if they were warring selfish tribes battling against each other much as they have done since the and this has got to change this is not a change in political systems or a change in ideology this is a change in culture we all of us have to understand that thinking inwards otherwise things are going to carry on getting bad and they 're going to get much worse much sooner than we anticipate the old mandate was very simple and very single if you 're in a position of power or authority you 're responsible for your own people and your own tiny slice of and if in order to do the best thing for your own people you screw over everybody else on the planet that 's even better that 's considered to be a bit macho you 're responsible for your own slice of territory and and that 's the message that we 've got to get across to our politicians and show them otherwise we 're i don 't have a problem actually with donald trump 's credo of america first it seems to me that that 's a pretty banal statement of what politicians have always done and probably should always do of course they 're elected to represent the interests of their own people but what i find so boring and so old fashioned and so unimaginative about his take on that is that america first means everyone else last that making america great again means making everybody else small again and it 's just not true in my job as a policy advisor over the last twenty years or so i 've seen so many hundreds of examples of policies that harmonize the international and the domestic needs and they make better policy i 'm not asking nations to be altruistic or self sacrificing that would be ridiculous no nation would ever do that i 'm asking them to wake up and understand that we need a new form of governance which is possible and which harmonizes those two needs those good for our own people and those good for everybody else since the us election and since brexit it 's become more and more obvious to me what does seem to matter today is very simple whether your view of the world or whether like me you find hope that 's the new division that is splitting the world right down the middle i don 't at all misunderstand why so many people find their comfort in looking when times are difficult when you 're short of money when you 're feeling insecure and vulnerable it 's almost a natural human tendency to turn inwards to think of your own needs and to discard everybody else 's and perhaps to start to imagine that the past was somehow better than the present or the future could ever be but i happen to believe that that 's a dead end history shows us that it 's a dead end when people human progress becomes reversed and things get worse for everybody very quickly indeed if you 're like me and you believe in forwards and outwards and the best thing about globalization that cultural mixture to make something more creative more exciting more productive than there 's ever been before in human history then my friends we 've got a job on our hands playing on the simplest instincts is sweeping across the world those of us who believe as i believe in forwards and outwards we have to get ourselves organized because time is running out very very quickly"
