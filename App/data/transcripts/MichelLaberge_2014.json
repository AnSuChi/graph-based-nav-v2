  "transcript": "so the whole planet needs a lot of energy and so far we 've been running mostly on fossil fuel we 've been burning gas but it proved quite difficult to find something that 's as convenient and as cost effective as oil gas and coal my personal favorite is nuclear energy and it doesn 't make any co2 now we know of two ways of making now i like fusion fusion 's much better and that 's very nice it makes lots of energy it only produces short term radioactive waste it cannot melt down now the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean in and if the whole planet would run on fusion we could extract the fuel from the ocean it would run for billions and billions of years well there 's always a bit of a so in order to make them fuse you have to throw and then i got a big job in a laser printer place making printing for the printing industry and then i was looking at my good work and what i was doing is i was cutting the forests around here in b c and burying you all of you in millions of tons of junk mail now that was not very satisfactory so some people buy a porsche but i 've decided to get my bit to solve global warming and make fusion happen now so the physicists have been working on fusion for a while and one of the ways they do it is with superconducting coil and it makes a magnetic field in a ring like this so this is the inside of one of those donuts and on the right side you can see the fusion plasma in there so this is the inside of one such machine you see the laser beam and the pellet in the center they always think that the physicists are in their lab and they 're working hard but nothing is happening that 's actually not quite true that 's a pretty good gain and this machine in but it 's actually pretty close considering we can get about ten thousand times more than we started the second dot here it 's a big laser machine in the u s and last month they announced with quite a bit of noise that they had managed to make more fusion energy from the fusion than the energy that they put in the center of the ping pong ball now that 's not quite good enough because the laser to put that that 's the kind of machine that makes energy now if you look at the graph you will notice that those two dots are a little bit on the right of the curve we kind of have fallen off the progress actually the science to make those machines was really in time to produce so it drifted to the right iter for example could have been built in two thousand or two thousand and five but because it 's a big international collaboration the politics got in and it delayed it a bit for example but you have to compare that to the cost of making moore 's law that cost way more than that the result of moore 's law is this cell phone here in my pocket i can take a selfie and put it on facebook then when my dad sees that he 'll be very proud we also spend about six hundred and fifty billion dollars a year in subsidies for oil and gas and renewable energy personally i don 't think it 's too expensive think it 's actually been shortchanged considering it can solve all our energy problems cleanly for the next couple of billions of years because i started a fusion company and i don 't even have a facebook account so when i started this fusion company in two thousand and two i knew so i decided i would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster and also they don 't deal very much with the fusion it damages it so i decided that surely there is a better way of doing that so back to the literature and i read about the fusion everywhere one way in particular attracted my attention and it 's called magnetized target fusion or mtf for short now in mtf what you want to do is you take a big vat and you fill that with liquid metal a bit like your sink when you pull the plug on a sink it makes a vortex and this compresses the liquid metal around the plasma and it compresses it it gets hotter like a laser and then it makes fusion so it 's a bit of a between a magnetized fusion and the laser fusion so those have a couple of very good advantages the liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons and no neutrons hit the wall and therefore there 's no damage to the machine so that 's a very convenient way of doing this part of the all the energy to make the fusion happen comes from which is way cheaper than lasers or superconducting coils now this was all very good except for the problem that it didn 't quite work there so when i saw that so we accelerate the pistons with steam that takes a little bit of time but then so we built this machine in this garage here we made a small machine that we managed to squeeze a little bit of neutrons out of that and those are my marketing and with those marketing neutrons then i raised about fifty million dollars so it 's going to be a big machine about three meters in diameter liquid lead spinning around and it will make some energy and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal going to go in a okay we also built this injector so this injector makes the plasma to start with it makes the plasma at about a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit but last month it got a lot better so i think we have the plasma so you need the timing of the piston to be very good and for that we use which was not possible in we are almost there the big labs have shown that fusion is doable and now there are small companies that are thinking about that and they say it 's not that it cannot be done but it 's how to make it cost effectively general fusion is one of those small thank you very much"
