  "transcript": "choices and behaviors will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and i think that that 's quite a powerful thought but it does have the potential to make us feel guilty when we think about decisions we might have made around where to travel to how often and how about the energy that we choose to use in our homes or in our workplaces but we can also turn that thought on its head and think that if we 've had such a profound then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to so we have a choice we can either choose and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions and not only that as people who live in countries with high per capita emissions we 're making that choice on behalf but the choice that we don 't have is a no climate change future and they 've been focused on avoiding a two degree centigrade warming above pre industrial levels that 's the temperature associated with dangerous impacts across a range of different indicators and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure where there are people that are well insured and so on but if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world where there is poor infrastructure or where people are not well insured or they 're not having good support networks then that same climate change impact could be devastating and what 's immediately striking about this is that emissions have been growing exponentially if we focus in on a shorter period of time from one thousand nine hundred and fifty we have established in the rio earth summit in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two then rolling on a few years in two thousand and nine we had the copenhagen accord where it and then in two thousand and twelve we had the rio + twenty event and all the way through during all of these meetings and many others as well and we put that together with our understanding of the direction of travel in our global economy then we are much more on track for a four degree centigrade global warming than we are for the two degree centigrade four degree global average temperature most of our planet is actually made up of the sea now because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land the average temperatures over land rainy days especially if you live in manchester like me imagine somewhere in the world maybe ten to twelve degrees warmer on that day during that heat wave that 's the kind of thing we 're going to experience under a four degree global and the problem with these extremes and not just the temperature extremes but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts is our infrastructure is just not set and this is going to be extremely so if we go back also thinking about four degrees it 's not just the direct maize and wheat yields in some parts of the world are expected to be up to forty percent lower so all in all the kinds of impacts anticipated under this four degree centigrade scenario are going to be incompatible with global organized living so back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees is it reasonable still to focus on the two degree path there are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists who would say that it 's now too late to avoid warming aviation and also shipping just to say that i think there is still a small fighting chance of avoiding this two degree dangerous climate change but we really need to get to grips with the numbers to work out how to two degree green pathway because of the lights and the projectors that are on in this room right now that is going into our atmosphere as a result of that electricity consumption and that 's important because it doesn 't matter if we come up with some amazing sort out our energy problem on the last day of so if we continue on this red four degree centigrade scenario pathway the longer we continue on it that will need to be made up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget to keep the same area under the curve so in other words if we don 't reduce emissions in the short to medium term then we 'll have to make more significant year on year emission reductions we also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system so this poses really big challenges for us the other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy and that 's because with all the will in the world the large scale engineering infrastructure that we need to roll out rapidly to decarbonize the supply side of our energy system upscale our biofuel production or go for a much bigger roll out of wind turbines and wave turbines all of that will take time using less energy and if we do that that also means that as we continue to roll out the supply side technology we will have less of a job to do if we 've actually managed to reduce our energy consumption because we will then need less infrastructure on the on the supply side another issue that we really need to grapple with is the issue and equity there are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise bbut with energy systems currently currently reliant on fossil fuel as those economies grow so will emissions and now if we 're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget then other parts of the world 's emissions need to reduce so that poses very significant because according to our research if you 're in a country where per capita emissions are really high so north america europe australia emissions reductions of the order of ten percent per year and starting immediately will be required for a good chance because if we have our high carbon infrastructure so i 'd just like to take a quote from a paper by myself and kevin anderson back in two thousand and eleven economic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations this is a really difficult this is not about just incremental change this is about and this applies to all of us whatever sphere of influence we have so it could be from writing to our local politician because we really need to make significant change there really is no time thank you bruno giussani alice basically what you 're saying the talk is unless wealthy nations start cutting ten percent per year the emissions now this year not in two thousand and scenario i am wondering what 's your take on the cut by seventy percent for two thousand and seventy alice bows larkin yeah it 's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees one of the things that often when there are these modeling studies that look at what we need to do is they tend to hugely overestimate how quickly other countries in the world can start to reduce emissions so they make kind of heroic assumptions about that the more we do that because it 's the cumulative emissions the short term stuff that really matters so it does make a huge difference if a big country like china for example continues to grow even for just a few extra but i think we 've just got huge scope and we don 't pull those levers that"
