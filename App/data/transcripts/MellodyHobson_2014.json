  "transcript": "so it 's two thousand and six my friend harold ford calls me he 's running for i desperately need some national press do you have any ideas so i had an idea i called a friend who was in new york at one of the most successful media companies in the world and she said why don 't we host an editorial board lunch for harold you come with him and we get to the receptionist and we say we 're here for the lunch and all of a sudden we find ourselves in a stark room at which point she looks at us and she says where are your uniforms and i look at her and i say now don 't you think we need more than one black person in the we still laugh about that story and i wasn 't surprised because of something my mother taught me you see my mother was and instead of asking me the normal motherly questions like did you have fun or how was the cake my mother looked at me and she said how did they treat you but she knew and she looked me right in the eye and she said they will not always treat you well of those topics in america that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable you bring it up at a dinner party or in a workplace environment it is literally the conversational equivalent of touching the third rail followed by a long silence and they warned me they told me don 't do it that there 'd be and i have to tell you i actually for a moment was a bit afraid then i realized the first step to solving any problem is to not hide from it and the first step to any of action and i decided that if i came here and shared with you some of my experiences that maybe we could all be a little less anxious now i know there are people out there who will say that the election of barack obama meant that it was the end of racial and here there are significant quantifiable racial disparities that cannot be ignored in household wealth household income job opportunities healthcare even though white men make up just thirty percent of the u s population they hold seventy percent of all corporate board seats and of the thousands of publicly traded companies today thousands and you 're looking at one of them the same one not too long ago was nearly mistaken for kitchen help imagine if i walked you into a room and every single person around the boardroom were black you would think that were weird and everyone and i know how we got here you know there was but still as i grapple with this issue my mother 's question hangs in the air for and i have been treated well by people of all races more often than i have not and i stand here today talking about this issue of racial discrimination because i believe it threatens to rob another generation if you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of people who look like you that 's purely accidental now color blindness in my view doesn 't mean that there 's no racial discrimination and there 's fairness it doesn 't mean that at all it doesn 't ensure it there was a corporate study that instead of avoiding race the really smart corporations actually deal with it head on including the majority one this subject matter can be hard awkward uncomfortable but that 's kind of the point in the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes the one that black people don 't like to swim i 'm going to tell you how much i love to swim i love to swim so much that as an adult i swim with a coach and i failed a lot by the end i got it but when i got the pool i was exasperated and tired and annoyed and i said why are we doing breath holding exercises and my coach looked me at me and he said mellody that was not a breath holding exercise that drill was to make you comfortable being uncomfortable because that 's how most of us spend our days if we can learn to deal with our discomfort and just relax into it we 'll have a better life so i think it 's time for us to be comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation about race black white asian hispanic male female all of us we have to be color brave we have to be willing as teachers and parents and entrepreneurs and scientists we have to be willing to have proactive conversations about race but because it 's the smart thing to do because our businesses and our products and our science our research all of that will be better with greater diversity now my favorite example color bravery he joined espn which already had a culture of inclusion and diversity but he took it up a notch he demanded that every open position have a diverse slate of candidates and they would come to him and say do you want me to hire the minority or do you want me to hire the best person for the job and skipper says his answers were always now i can tell you in my own industry at ariel investments we actually view our diversity as a competitive advantage he says if you 're trying to solve a really hard problem really hard that you should have a diverse group of people including those with diverse intellects the example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic when it was ravaging europe and the beginnings of the cure to the disease came from the most unlikely source a dairy farmer who noticed that the were not getting smallpox and the smallpox vaccination now i know at work at school at home invite people into your life who don 't look like you don 't act like you don 't come from where you come from and you might find that they will challenge your assumptions and make you grow as a person you might get powerful new insights from these individuals now i also think that this is very important so that the next generation really understands that this progress will help them because they 're expecting us to be great role models now i told you my mother she was ruthlessly realistic she was an unbelievable role model she was the kind of person who got to be the way she was because she was a single mom with six kids in chicago she was in the real estate business where she worked extraordinarily hard but oftentimes had a hard time making ends and we would but she never gave up hope ever and she never allowed us to give up hope either this brutal pragmatism that she had i mean i was four and she told me mommy is santa laughter she was this brutal pragmatism you can be anything and because of those i would i dreamed the biggest dreams and it 's because of those words that i stand here right now full of passion asking you to be brave for the kids who are dreaming those dreams today them to look at a ceo on television and say i can be like her or he looks like me and i want them to know that anything is possible that they can achieve the highest level that they ever imagined you see this idea of being the land of the free and the home of the brave it 's woven into the fabric of america america when we have a challenge we take it head on we don 't shrink away from it as business leaders i 'm asking you not to leave anything on the table as"
