  "transcript": "when we think of games there 's all kinds of things maybe you 're ticked off or maybe you 're looking forward to a new game you 've been up too late playing a game all these things happen to me but when we think about games a lot of times we think about stuff like this first person shooters or the or maybe you 're a facebook game player this is one my partner and i worked on maybe you play facebook games and that 's what we 're making right now this is a lighter form of game maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations this would be one of the tragically boring board games that you can figure out or maybe you 're in your living room playing with the wii with the kids and that 's very much what i think about i make my living from games i 've been lucky enough to do this since i was fifteen which also qualifies as i 've never really had a real job but we think about games as fun and that 's completely reasonable and this is when the americans beat the people cried i 've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of three hundred and fifty one years it was amazing i happened to be living in springfield at the time and the best part of it was you would close the the women 's door in the bathroom and i remember seeing go sox and i thought really or the houses you 'd come out because every game well i think almost every game went into overtime right so we 'd be outside and all the other lights are on in the whole block and kids the the attendance was down in school kids weren 't going i can die now because the red sox won this is an abrupt transition there was three years where i actually did have a real job sort of i was the head of a college department teaching games so again it was sort of a real job and now i got to talk about making them as opposed to making them part of the job of it when you 're a chair of a department is to eat and i did that very well and so i 'm out at a dinner with this guy and he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself and this particular shot so you can look at this and maybe you 've even seen things like this this is an expression of culture right and this is actually from his degradation series and what was most fascinating to me about this series is just look at that little boy there can you imagine that that 's a traditional native american now i just want to change that guy 's race just imagine if that 's a black guy so honey come here let 's get you a picture with the black guy and so zig being indian likewise it baffles his mind his favorite photograph my favorite photograph of his which i don 't have in here is indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of indians and it was on an indian reservation he 'd taken his camera up there to photograph it but when he got there he discovered he couldn 't do it he just couldn 't capture the picture because it never occurs to me should i make the game about this difficult topic or not because we just make things that are fun or will make you feel fear that visceral excitement so this is my kid this is maezza and when she was seven years old she came home from school one day and like i do every single day i asked her what did you do today so she said we talked about the middle passage now this was a big maezza 's dad is black and i knew this day was coming i wasn 't expecting it at seven i don 't know why but i wasn 't anyways so i asked her how do you feel about that so she proceeded to tell me and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here the ships start in england they come down from england they go to africa they go across the ocean that 's the middle passage but abraham lincoln was elected president and then he passed the emancipation proclamation and now they 're free pause for about ten seconds can i play a game mommy and i thought you know this is the middle passage this is an incredibly significant event and she 's treating it like basically some black people went on a cruise this is more or less how it sounds to her i said yes and so i happened to have all of these little pieces i 'm a game designer so i have this stuff sitting around my house i said yeah you can play a game and i give her a bunch of these and i tell her to paint them in different families these are pictures of maezza when she was god it still chokes me up seeing these so she 's painting her little families so then i grab a bunch of them and i put them on a boat this was the boat it was made quickly obviously and so the basic gist of it is i grabbed a bunch of families and she 's like mommy but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things and she says they want to go and i said honey no they don 't want to go this is the middle passage nobody wants to go on the middle passage so she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother and she says to me we 're not going to make it we don 't have enough food and so she asks what to do and i i say remember she 's seven we can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don 't get sick and we make it to the other side this is her brother and sister if i came out of the woods avalon and donovan might be gone yes but i 'd get to see them in america no but what if i saw them couldn 't we stay together so daddy could be gone yes she was fascinated by this and she started to cry i started to cry her father started to cry and now we 're all crying he didn 't expect to come home from work to the middle passage but we made this game and she she got it she got it because she spent time with these people it wasn 't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie and so it was just an incredibly powerful experience this is the game which i 've ended up calling the new world because i like the phrase i don 't think the new world felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on i 'd been making games for 20 some years i made another game called train i was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics and if you 're going to cover a difficult topic this is one you need to cover and i 'll let you figure out what that 's about on your own and i also made a game about the and the one i 'm working on right now which is because i 'm right in the middle of it and these for some reason choke me up like crazy is a game called mexican kitchen workers and originally it was a math problem more or less here 's the economics of illegal immigration and the more i learned about mexican culture my partner is mexican the more i learned that you know for all of us food is a basic need and it is obviously with mexicans too but it 's much more than that it 's an expression of love it 's an expression of god i 'm totally choking up way more than i thought i 'll look away from the picture it 's an expression of beauty it 's how they say they love you it 's how they say they care and you can 't hear somebody talk about their mexican grandmother without saying food in the first sentence and it changes ourselves we change as people through games because we 're involved and we 're playing and we 're learning as we do so"
