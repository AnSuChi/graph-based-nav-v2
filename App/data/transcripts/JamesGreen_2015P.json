  "transcript": "wow what a powerful question you know as a scientist planetary scientist we really didn 't take that carl sagan always said it takes extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims and the claims of having life beyond earth need to be definitive they need to be loud and they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it how do we make this journey what we decided to do is first look for those ingredients for life the ingredients of life we also have to have organic material things that make us but also things that we need to consume so we have to have these elements in environments for long periods of time for us to be able to be confident that life well i have to tell you that early in my career when we venus is way too hot it 's got no water but recent observations have changed all that it 's now turning our attention to the right places for us to take a deeper look and really the planet mars and then three moons of the outer planets let 's go through the evidence arid and a dead world and so about fifteen years ago we started a series of missions to go to mars and see if water existed on mars in its past that changed its geology we ought to be able to notice that and indeed we started to be surprised right away our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys that were there in the past and in fact which has been roving on the surface now for about three years has really shown us curiosity has also drilled we tasted it and guess what hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus sulfur they were all there so mars in its past with a lot of water perhaps plenty of time the more the more of these features we now know more than a dozen of them we announced to the world that we know what these streaks are it 's liquid water these craters are weeping during the summer so what are we going to do now now that we see the water so what are we going to do next we 're going to launch a series of missions to begin that search for life on mars and now it 's more appealing than ever before as we move out into the solar system here 's the tiny moon enceladus this area around the sun this is much further out this object should be ice but what did we and after a couple years looked back after it flew by enceladus and surprised us all enceladus is blasting sheets of water out into the solar system and sloshing back down onto the moon cassini just a few months ago also flew through the plume but it 's also doing that to the core the only thing that we can think of that does that here on earth as an analogy are hydrothermal vents hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in and now there are thousands of these below the ocean the when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents they 're teeming with life regardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline so hydrothermal vents are a fabulous abode for life here on earth well we believe because it has water and has had it for a significant period of time and we believe it has hydrothermal vents with perhaps the right organic and not just microbial maybe more complex galileo visited jupiter 's system of europa europa we also know observing saw plumes of water spraying from the cracks in the southern hemisphere just exactly like enceladus these moons which are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone that are out in the solar system have liquid water and if there are organics there there may be life this is a fabulous set of discoveries because these moons have been in this environment like that for billions of years we believe after about the first five hundred million and look where we are these moons are fabulous moons it perhaps is much larger than the planet mercury it has an extensive atmosphere it 's so extensive and it 's mostly actually almost the size of our black sea in some places and this area is not liquid water methane if there 's any place in the solar system where life is not like us the data that we 're receiving is really exciting and if we answer it and it 's positive just think about that we may not be alone"
