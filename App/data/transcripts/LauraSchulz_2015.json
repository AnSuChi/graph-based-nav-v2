  "transcript": "mark twain summed up what i take to be one of the fundamental problems of cognitive science with a single witticism one gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment in fact twain meant it as a joke of course but he 's right there 's something fascinating about science we infer the existence of dinosuars the composition of nebulae the mechanisms of heredity or in my case from the behavior of very young children we try to say something about the fundamental mechanisms of human cognition i have spent the past decade trying to understand the mystery of how children learn so much from so little so quickly because it turns out that the fascinating thing about science is also a fascinating thing about children which to put a gentler spin on mark twain is precisely their ability to draw rich abstract inferences rapidly and accurately i 'm going to give you just two examples today one is about a problem of generalization let me start with the problem of generalization we poll a tiny fraction of the electorate and we predict the but this only works if our sample is randomly drawn from the population if our sample is cherry picked in some way we include only men so scientists care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not but what does that have to do with babies well or a few balls and learn that they and they develop expectations about ducks and balls that they 're going to extend to rubber ducks and balls for the rest of their lives so do babies care whether the tiny bit of evidence they see is plausibly representative of a larger population let 's find out but these babies of course here stand in for groups of babies and the differences you 're going to see represent average group differences in babies ' behavior across in each movie you 're going to see a baby doing maybe just exactly what you might expect a baby to do and we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are but to my mind the magical thing because the only thing that differs between these two movies is the statistical we 're going to show babies a box of blue and yellow balls and my now colleague at stanford it doesn 't get better than that so maybe babies should expect those yellow balls to squeak as well those yellow balls have funny sticks on the end so babies could do other things with them if they wanted to they could pound them or whack them but let 's see what the baby does this one 's for you you can go ahead and play i don 't even have to talk right all the really interesting question is what happens when we show babies exactly the same thing and we can ensure it 's exactly the same because we have a secret compartment and we actually pull the balls from there all we change is the apparent population from which that evidence was drawn we 're going to show babies three blue balls pulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls and guess what you [ probably won 't ] randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow plausibly randomly sampled evidence maybe only the blue balls squeak let 's see what the baby does so you just saw two 15 month old babies do entirely different things based only on the probability of the sample they observed on the vertical axis you 'll see the percentage of babies who squeezed the ball in each condition and as you 'll see babies are much more likely to generalize the evidence when it 's plausibly representative of the population than when the evidence is clearly cherry picked and this leads to a fun prediction suppose you pulled just one blue ball out of the mostly yellow box you [ probably so even though babies are going to see much less evidence for squeaking and have many fewer actions to imitate in this one ball condition than in the condition you we predicted that babies themselves would squeeze more and that 's exactly what babies in this respect like scientists care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not and they use this to develop expectations about the world what squeaks and what doesn 't what to explore and what to ignore but like most problems it 's only a problem when things go wrong take this baby for instance things are going wrong for him he would like to make this toy go and he can maybe he 's doing something wrong we 're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other and we 're going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions about what to do here 's the setup hyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed and this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students in technology across the and so let 's see what the baby does see these toys yeah i 'm going to put this one over here and i 'm going to give this one to you you can go ahead and play of course babies love their mommies of course babies give toys to their mommies when they can 't make them work so again the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly this time babies are going to the toy work and fail in exactly the same order but we 're changing the distribution of evidence this time hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once and so am i and this suggests it doesn 't matter who tries this toy the toy is broken it doesn 't work all the time let me try one more time and i 'm going to give this one to you on the vertical axis you 'll see the distribution of children 's choices in each condition so in the second year of life babies can use a tiny bit of statistical data to because the really critical point is that children 's ability to make rich inferences from sparse data underlies all the they learn new causal relationships from just a few examples they even learn new words in this case in american sign language i want to close with just two points if you 've been following my world the field of brain and sciences for the past few years three big ideas will have come to your attention the first is that this is the era of the brain and indeed there have been staggering discoveries in neuroscience localizing functionally specialized regions of cortex turning mouse brains transparent activating neurons with a second big idea is that this is the era of big data and machine learning and the final big idea you 'll have heard is that maybe it 's a good idea we 're going to know so much about brains and because left to our own devices and in innumerable ways and they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be human but i want you to note that today i told you a very different story it 's a story about minds and not brains and in particular it 's a story about the kinds of computations that uniquely human minds can perform which involve rich structured knowledge and the ability to learn from small amounts of data the evidence of just a few examples and fundamentally it 's a story about how starting as very small children folks human minds do not only learn from small amounts of data human minds think of altogether new ideas we even heal them in the years to come we 're going to see technological innovations beyond anything i can even envision but we are very unlikely to see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours if we invest in these most powerful learners and their development in babies and children and mothers and fathers and caregivers and teachers teachers thank you very much i mean who would design an experiment like that i 've seen that a couple of times and i still don 't honestly believe that that can truly be happening but other people have done similar experiments it checks out the babies really are that genius ls you know they look really impressive in our experiments but think about what they look like in real it 's talking to you and babies ' first words aren 't just things like balls and ducks they 're things like all gone which refer to disappearance or uh oh which refer to unintentional actions they 're figuring out the entire world a four year old can talk to you about almost anything you 're really saying that the bigger story is is how extraordinary and there really is genius there that is underappreciated ls one of my favorite quotes in psychology comes from the social psychologist solomon asch and he said the fundamental task of psychology is to remove the veil of there are you can walk through rooms you can figure out what you know about moral reasoning you do this effortlessly so we don 't see it but that is how we get the world right and it 's a remarkable and very difficult to understand accomplishment ca what 's clear is that in any scenario our machines have so much to learn from our toddlers ls i think so you 'll have some machine learning folks up here i mean you should never bet against babies or chimpanzees or technology as a matter of practice but it 's a difference in kind we have incredibly powerful computers and they do do amazingly sophisticated things often with very big amounts of data i think something quite different and i think it 's the structured hierarchical nature of human knowledge that remains a real challenge ca laura schulz wonderful food for thought thank you so much"
