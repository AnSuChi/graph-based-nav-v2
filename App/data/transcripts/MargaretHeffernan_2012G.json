  "transcript": "in oxford in the 1950s there was a fantastic doctor who was very unusual named alice stewart she was one fellow to be elected to the royal college of physicians she was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married after she had kids and even after she got divorced and was a single parent she continued her medical work and she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science the emerging field of epidemiology the study of patterns in disease but like every scientist she appreciated that to make her mark what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it the hard problem that alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data now she had no idea what to look for this really was a needle in a haystack sort of search so she asked everything she could think of had the children eaten boiled sweets had they consumed colored drinks did they eat fish and chips and when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can the children who had died had had mothers who had been x rayed when pregnant it flew in the face of conventional wisdom which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age which was the nevertheless alice stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in the lancet in one thousand nine hundred and fifty six and alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find twenty five years before the british and medical british and american medical establishments abandoned the pregnant women it was open it was freely available but nobody wanted to know openness alone can 't drive change she worked with a statistician named george kneale and george was pretty much everything that alice wasn 't so alice was very outgoing and sociable and george was a recluse alice was very warm but he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship he said my job is to prove dr stewart wrong different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her he saw his job as creating conflict around her theories because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong that george could give alice the confidence she needed it 's a fantastic model of collaboration thinking partners who i wonder how many of us have or dare to have such collaborators alice and george were very good at conflict they saw it so what does that kind of constructive conflict first of all it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves different disciplines different ways of thinking and different experience and find ways to engage with them that requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy and the more i 've thought about this the more i think really that that 's a kind of love because you simply won 't commit that kind of energy and time and it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds alice 's daughter told me that every time alice went head to head with a fellow scientist but she was really good at them so it 's one thing to do that in a one to one relationship but it strikes me that the biggest problems we face many of the biggest disasters that we 've experienced mostly haven 't come from individuals they 've come from organizations some of them bigger than countries many of them capable of affecting hundreds thousands even millions so how do organizations think well for the most and that isn 't because they don 't want to it 's really because they can 't and they can 't because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict in surveys of european and american executives fully eighty five percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise afraid of the conflict that that would provoke afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage and felt that they were bound to lose eighty five percent is a really big number it means that organizations mostly can 't do what george and alice so triumphantly did they can 't think together and it means that people like many of us who have run organizations and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can mostly fail so how do we develop the skills that we need because it does take if we aren 't going to be afraid of conflict we have to see it as thinking and then we have to get really good at it so recently i worked with and joe was very worried about the device that he was working on he thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error but when he looked around his organization nobody else seemed to be at all worried so he didn 't really want to say anything after all maybe they knew something he didn 't maybe he 'd look stupid but he kept worrying about it and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved so now joe had allies but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative to solve the problem and to change the device joe was what a lot of people but he had been so afraid of conflict until finally he became more afraid and when he dared to speak he discovered much more inside himself and his colleagues don 't think of him as a crank they think of him well the university of delft requires that its phd students have to submit five statements that they 're prepared to defend it doesn 't really matter what the statements are about what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority i think it 's a fantastic system but i think leaving it to phd candidates is far too few people and way too late in life i think we need to be teaching these skills the fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we 've witnessed rarely come from information that is secret the conflict but when we dare to break that silence or when we dare to see and we create conflict we enable openness isn 't the end"
