  "transcript": "11th last year i stood alone at the north geographic pole i was the only human being in an area and i think the reason for that i skied the equivalent of and i was dragging sleeping bag one change of underwear everything i needed for nearly three months what the second the loo at minus forty ben i 've read somewhere that at minus forty exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute so how do you answer the call of nature i don 't want to answer these now i 'll come on to them at the end third one how do you top that what 's next we were trying to ski from this group of islands up here severnaya zemlya to the north pole that fascinates me about the north pole geographic north pole is that it 's slap bang in the middle of the sea this is about as good as maps get the floating skin of ice on the artic ocean i 'd spoken to all the experts i 'd read lots of books i studied maps and charts but i realized on the morning of day one that i had no idea exactly what i 'd let myself in for i was twenty three years old age had attempted anything like this and we started running very low on food we were both pretty hungry losing lots of weight some very unusual weather conditions very difficult ice conditions we had we couldn 't afford a satellite phone so we had hf radio you can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent there 's a a wire dangling down either side that was our hf radio antenna we had less than two hours two way communication with the outside world in two months ultimately we ran out of time we 'd skied four hundred miles we were just just over two two hundred miles left to go to the pole and we 'd run out of time we were too late into the summer the ice was starting to melt we spoke to the russian helicopter pilots on the radio and they said you 've run out of time we 've got to pick you up and i felt that i had the one goal the one dream i 'd had for as long as i could remember i hadn hadn 't even come close and skiing along that first trip i had two imaginary video clips that i 'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough just to keep my keep my motivation going the first one was reaching the pole itself there was kind of rock music playing in the background and i had a the second video clip that i imagined was was getting back to heathrow airport and i could see again vividly the autograph hunters the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal and of course neither of these things happened we didn 't get to the pole and we didn 't have any money to pay anyone to do the pr so no one had heard my granddad was there had a little union jack a failure in a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition and lying on my mum 's sofa day in day out watching daytime tv the lesson is don 't even try fast forward three years i did eventually get off the sofa and start planning another expedition this time i wanted to go right across on my own this time from russia at the top of the map to the north pole where the sort of kink in the middle is and then on to canada no one has made a complete crossing of the arctic ocean on their own two norwegians did it as a team in two thousand no one 's done it solo very famous very accomplished italian mountaineer reinhold messner tried it in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five and he was rescued after a week he described this expedition as ten times so for some reason this was what i wanted to have a crack at but i knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece let alone make it across to canada i had to take a radical approach this meant everything from perfecting the strategy from scratch six thousand calories a day and the expedition started in february last year big support team we had a film crew a couple of logistics people with us my girlfriend a the next bit in siberia to krasnoyarsk on a russian internal airline called chartered a pretty elderly russian plane to fly us up to a town called khatanga which was the the sort of last bit of civilization our cameraman who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times actually asked the pilot before we got on the plane how long this flight would take and the pilot russian pilot completely deadpan replied six hours if we live we got to khatanga i think the joke is that khatanga isn 't the end of the world but you can see it from there it was supposed to be an overnight stay we were stuck there for ten days there was a kind of vodka fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter so we were stuck we couldn 't move finally morning of day eleven we got the all clear loaded up we had a frantic sort of minutes of filming photography while the helicopter was still there and i was alone and i don 't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice all i could think about was running back up to the door high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen the ice is going to start moving around a bit ninety five days of food and fuel leave it and go back and get the other one literally scrambling scrambling through what 's called pressure ice the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean the wind and the tides and i was drifting backwards most of the time and i was two and a half miles further back drifted back about five miles it was artic was warming i knew there was more open water weapon up my sleeve this was my little bit of bio mimicry polar bears on the artic ocean move in in dead straight lines if they come to water they 'll climb in swim across it so we had a dry suit developed i worked with a team in norway based on a sort of survival suit i suppose that helicopter pilots would wear and this meant i could ski over very thin ice if i fell through it wasn 't the end of the world it also meant if the worst came to the worst i could actually jump in and swim across and some pretty radical technology a radical approach but it worked perfectly another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology in one thousand nine hundred and twelve shackleton 's endurance expedition there was one of his crew a guy called thomas if there is anything left to explore will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes well orde lees guessed wrong by about eight years this is my pocket wireless telephone iridium satellite phone the wireless telescope was a digital camera i had tucked in my pocket and every single day of the seventy two days i was alone on the ice i was sending back a little diary piece sending back information on the distance i 'd covered the ice conditions the temperature and a daily photo remember two thousand and one we had blogging live from an expedition that 's been described as ten times when you get pretty soon it will drift off usually towards canada this but i was expecting something strange mixture of feelings it was extremely warm by this stage a lot of open water around and elated that i 'd got there under my own steam but starting to to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to canada which was still four hundred miles away were slim at best the only proof i 've got that i was there is a blurry photo you can just see there 's a nine and a string of zeros here ninety degrees north that is slap bang in the north pole i i i dialed my girlfriend i dialed the ceo of my sponsor and i got three voicemails i skied on for a week past the pole i wanted to get as close to canada as i could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue when i spoke to the my project management team they said look ben conditions are getting too dangerous we 'd like to pick you up ben could you please look for an airstrip this was the view outside my tent when i when i had this this fateful phone call i thick safe ice the only bit of ice i hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip was exactly four hundred and seventy three meters i could measure it with my with my skis it 'll have to do oh oh oh oh oh oh bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed a pretty emotional moment so i thought i 've got to compose myself for troy i 'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type the plane taxied up to where i was standing the door opened this guy jumped out he 's about that tall he climbed up the ladder he said just just get in the back he threw his cigarette out as he got on the front and i climbed in the back laughter taxied up and down the runway a few times just to flatten it out a bit and he said right i 'm going to i 'm going to give it a go and he i 've now learned that this is he put his hand on the throttle monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his i thought god here we go we 're we 're this is all or nothing rammed it forwards bounced down the runway just took off one of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway and it was the fasten seat belt sign you can see on the only from the air did did i see the big picture of course when you 're on the ice you only ever see one obstacle at a time whether it 's a pressure ridge or there 's a bit of water this is probably why i didn 't get into trouble about the the length of my airstrip i mean it really was starting to break up i 'm not skiing along drawing maps everyone knows where the north pole is at the south pole there 's a big scientific base there 's an airstrip there 's a cafe and there 's a tourist shop for me this is about exploring human limits about exploring the limits of physiology of psychology and of technology they 're the things that excite me on a personal level this for me is a chance to to explore the limits really push the limits of my own potential see how far they it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential just doing three or four or five percent of what they 're truly capable of so i hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to to think about and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet that 's as close as i can come to summing that up the next question is how do you answer the call of nature at minus forty the answer of course to which is is a trade secret and the last question what 's next have a minute left at the end i 'll go into more detail what 's next it 's the coldest highest windiest and driest continent on earth a race to be the first to the south pole the heart of the antarctic continent if you include the coastal ice shelves you can see that the ross ice shelf it 's the big one down here the ross ice shelf is the size of france antarctica if you include the ice shelves is twice the size of australia it 's a big place and there 's a race to get to the pole between amundsen the norwegian amundsen had dog sleds and huskies and scott the british guy captain scott scott had sort of ponies and and some tractors and a few dogs all of which went wrong and scott and his team of four people ended up on foot they got to the pole late january one thousand nine hundred and twelve to find a norwegian flag already there there was a tent a letter to the norwegian king and they turned around headed back to the coast and all five of them died on the return journey since no one has ever skied this was ninety three years ago since then no one has ever skied from the coast of antarctica to the pole and back every south pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing no one has ever made a return journey so that 's the plan two of us are doing it that 's pretty much it"
