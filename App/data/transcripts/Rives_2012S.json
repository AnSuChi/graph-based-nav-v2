  "transcript": "which made me nostalgic because i remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when i was a kid maybe twelve years old and i entered the term earth you can start anywhere this time i chose earth and the first rule of the game is pretty simple you just have to read the article until you find something you don 't know and preferably something your dad doesn 't even know and in this case it 's the tip of this mountain mount chimborazo in ecuador and even though mount chimborazo isn 't the tallest and it is really fun now in the old days that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically maybe getting sidetracked that was fun i just decided to click on the word tropical but i was surprised to learn this little fact those are not cartographers ' lines like they move they go up they go down in fact for years the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about so human diversity there are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet they 're all over the globe but virtually all of them live the link that i clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end it mentioned leopards and and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera out to be now i clicked on this on purpose but if i 'd somehow gotten here by mistake it does remind me for the band see the beatles for the car see volkswagon beetle but i am here for beetle beetles this is the most successful order on the planet by far something between twenty and twenty five percent of all life forms on the planet including plants are beetles that means the next time you are in the grocery store take a look at and if it is you you are astonishingly well adapted there are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums there are predator beetles that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings this reminded the ancient egyptians of their god khepri who renews the ball of the sun every morning which is how that dung rolling scarab became fireflies are not flies fireflies are beetles the chemical language of pheromones now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex yeah and the link to aphrodisiac now that 's something that increases sexual desire possibly you might have to experiment the link i clicked on here i do like magic so when i click on sympathetic magic i get sympathetic magic is imitation if you imitate something maybe you can have an effect on it that 's the idea behind voodoo dolls and possibly also cave paintings the link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind i would love to see google maps inside some of these caves we 've got usually the left hand we have been a for millenia i can easily picture how he did it and i really don 't think it 's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that i 'm going to use now to click on the term for hand now that 's embarrassing because up until now every time i 've said i know it like the back of my hand i 've really been saying i 'm totally familiar with that i just don 't know it 's freaking name right i click on chimpanzee i get our closest genetic relative pan troglodytes the name we give him means cave dweller like my next link the almost irresistible link and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles in between those two landmarks in ham 's life soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin soviet estimates put this guy at one point six five meters that is germans occupied russia a nazi officer and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut years later the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space the first one of any of us to really physically he didn 't just leave it and filmed it so you can go online and you can watch over one hundred minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride possibly a lonely one the first person to ever see such a thing and then when you 've had your fill of that you return to where you started you i quickly landed on this one the earth has a tolerance of about 17 percent from the reference spheroid which is less than what this means is that if you could shrink the earth to the size of a billiard ball if you could take planet earth with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees voodoo dolls fireflies chocolate it would be as smooth i didn 't know that chimborazo"
