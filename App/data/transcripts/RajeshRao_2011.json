  "transcript": "i 'd like to begin with a thought experiment imagine that it 's four thousand years into the future civilization as we know it has ceased to exist no books no electronic devices no facebook or twitter all knowledge of the english language what might they find well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic with strange symbols on them perhaps some circular pieces of metal maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them and perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity when she discovers buried in the hills somewhere in north america massive versions of these same symbols now let 's ask ourselves what could such artifacts say about us to people four thousand years into the future this is no hypothetical question in fact this is exactly the kind of question we 're faced with when we try to understand the indus valley civilization which existed four thousand years ago covering what is now what archeologists have found is none of that they 've found small objects such as these here 's an example but who is this person a king a god pottery and surprisingly one large sign we don 't even know what any of these objects say we don 't know what any of these symbols mean the symbols are most commonly found on seals so you see up there one such object it 's the square object with the unicorn like animal on it now that 's a magnificent piece of art so how big do you think that is perhaps that big well let me show you it 's only about one inch by one inch in size so what were these used for we know that these were used for stamping clay tags that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other so you know those packing slips you get on your fedex boxes these were used to make those kinds of packing slips you might wonder what these objects contain in terms of their text perhaps they 're the name of the sender or some information about the goods that are being sent from one place to the other we don 't know we need to decipher the script to answer that question it 's actually become a question that 's become deeply intertwined with the politics and the cultural history of there 's a group of people who are very passionate in their belief that the indus script does not represent a language at all these people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find there 's a second group of people who believe that the indus script represents an indo european language if you look at a map of india today so some people believe that the indus script represents an ancient indo european language these people believe that the indus script and the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of dravidian speaking people in the north actually near afghanistan and they say that perhaps sometime in the past dravidian languages were spoken all over india and that this suggests that the indus civilization is perhaps also dravidian but deciphering the script is a very challenging task first there 's no rosetta stone i don 't mean the software i mean an ancient artifact that contains and furthermore we don 't even know what language they spoke and to make matters even worse most of the text that we have are extremely short so as i showed you they 're usually found on these seals that are very very tiny and so given these formidable obstacles one might wonder and worry in the rest of my talk i 'd like to tell you about how i learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the indus script i 've always been fascinated by the indus script ever since i read i create computer models of the brain to try to understand how the brain makes predictions how the brain makes decisions how the brain learns and so on but in two thousand and seven my path crossed again with the indus script and so it was then that i realized there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists and so i jumped at that opportunity and i 'd like to describe some of the results that we have found or better yet the first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script is try to figure out the direction of writing can you tell me if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right i 'll give you a couple of seconds right to left how many and so they had to cram the sign other properties of language does the script show the indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns and this is very similar to a q and u example this symbol can in turn be followed by there 's some signs that really prefer the end of texts such as this this sign in fact happens to be the most frequently occurring sign in the script and so we gave the computer the existing texts and the computer learned given the computer model we can test the model by so we could deliberately erase some symbols and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols here are some examples you may regard this as perhaps the most ancient game of wheel of fortune in seventy five percent of cases in predicting the correct symbol in the rest of the cases typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer there 's a lot of these texts that are damaged here 's an example of one such text and we can use the computer model now to try to complete and this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script by generating more data that we can analyze so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard i think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this but just imagine it 's a really random jumble of letters how many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard you might have encountered the stuck key problem so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again this kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy because there 's no variation at all language on the other hand nor is it too random what about the indus script here 's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences at the very top you find the uniformly random sequence which is a random jumble of letters and interestingly we also find the dna sequence at the lower end of the scale you find a rigid sequence a sequence of all a 's and you also find a computer program in this case in the language fortran which obeys really strict rules my students said that i should really seriously consider getting some protection have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession so as the old saying goes well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages so for example here 's the same sentence written in english and the same sentence written in dutch using the same letters of the alphabet if you don 't know dutch and you only know english and you 'll say these words are probably not english words the same thing happens in the case of the indus script the computer found several texts two of them are shown here that have and it 's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair we went back and looked at where these particular texts were found and it turns out that they were found very very far away from the indus valley they were found in present and why were they found there and so in this case they were traveling by sea all the way to mesopotamia present day iraq and what seems to have happened here is that the indus traders the merchants were using this script to write a foreign language it 's just like our english and dutch example and that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns the results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion then how do we read the symbols that 's our next big challenge so you 'll notice that many of the symbols look like pictures of humans of insects of fishes of birds here 's a word can you write it using pictures got it okay great here 's my solution you could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf and that 's belief right there could be other solutions so this is just like a crossword puzzle except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the are so high if you solve it my colleagues iravatham mahadevan and asko parpola have been making some headway on this particular problem and i 'd like to give you a quick example of and i want to mention that these seals were used for stamping clay tags that were in dravidian which is the dravidian word for the big dipper star constellation there 's other combinations such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it and that could be translated into mey meen which is the old dravidian name for but if more and more of these readings start making sense and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct then we know that we are on the right track we can write a word such as the decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly but the indus civilization remains silent why should we care the indus civilization does not belong to just the it belongs to all of us these are our ancestors yours and mine they were silenced by an unfortunate accident of history we would enable them to speak to us again what would they tell us what would i can 't wait to find out thank you"
