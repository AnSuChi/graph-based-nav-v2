  "transcript": "and i 'm here today to talk to you about trust my job depends upon it there has to be between me and the orchestra an unshakable bond born out of mutual respect through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in conducting music making was less about trust and more frankly about coercion up to and around about the second world war conductors were invariably dictators these tyrannical figures who would rehearse not just the orchestra as a whole but individuals within it within an inch of their i 'm happy to say now that the world has moved on music has moved on with it we now have a more democratic view and way of making music a two way street i within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine i have to completely trust my body language that 's all i have at the point of sale it 's silent gesture i can hardly bark out instructions while we 're playing k k all this to work what do you do you overcompensate and in my game that means you overgesticulate you end up like some kind of rabid windmill i spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms and how futile seemed the words the words of advice to me from you crush it if you hold it too loosely it flies away i have to say in those days i couldn 't really even find the bird now a fundamental and really viscerally important experience for me in terms of music has been my adventures in south africa the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view but a country through its musical culture has taught me one fundamental lesson that through music making can come deep levels of fundamental life giving trust mainly in rural township locations right around the country i heard about two thousand singers and pulled together a company of forty of the most jaw droppingly amazing young performers the majority of whom were black but there were a handful and in the last years of the old regime he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room the general and that showed me such a that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words so we got some shows off the ground we started touring them internationally one of them was carmen we then thought we 'd make a movie of carmen which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside cape town called khayelitsha the piece was sung entirely in xhosa which is a beautifully musical language if you don 't know it it 's called u carmen e khayelitsha want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about south african music making oh something which i find utterly south africans just make music really freely and i think in no small you can teach a bunch of south africans a tune in about five seconds flat and then as if by magic they will spontaneously improvise i think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music that somehow it 's all about skill and systems therefore it 's the exclusive preserve of talented body every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis but how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music this you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue fiber dna what makes a great piece of music great on three notes t e d now hang on a minute i know you 're going to say to me t doesn 't exist in music well if i sing you a musical scale a g and i just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet same the same as f in music so t is f so t e d is the same as f e d now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme which is ted have a listen or do i smell some doubt in the room okay we 'll play it for you again now and we 're going to highlight we 're going to poke out the t if you 'll pardon the expression my goodness me it was loud and clear surely we 're going to sing those three wonderful notes t e d will you have a go for me audience t e d charles hazlewood yeah you sound a bit more like cows really than than human beings shall we try that one again and look if you 're adventurous you go up the octave you will sing that there 's a project that i 'm initiating at the moment that i 'm very excited about and wanted to share with you because it is all about changing perceptions and indeed building a new level of trust if you don aside from her very existence is that it 's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community that was hitherto hidden the community of disabled people and i found myself looking at the paralympics and thinking how incredible how technology 's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt that disability is no barrier to the highest levels of sporting there 's a grimmer side to that truth which is that it 's actually taken decades for the world at large to come to a position of trust to really believe that disability and sports so i find myself asking where is music in all of this so i decided to create a platform for that potential it 's going to be britain 's first ever national disabled orchestra it 's called paraorchestra i 'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had it was a really extraordinary moment just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians normally when you improvise and i do it all the time around the world there 's this initial period of like everyone 's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring an awful pregnant silence bang we 're all in there and it 's complete bedlam you can 't hear anything no one 's listening no one 's trusting no one 's now in this room with these four disabled musicians within five minutes a rapt listening a rapt response and some really i was born without my left hand right hand 'm making music i feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane i become alive from playing an instrument and performing please let me know now my parting shot comes courtesy of the great joseph haydn wonderful austrian composer in the but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time which is just on the place called esterhazy a long way from the big city of vienna now one day in one thousand seven hundred and seventy two the prince decreed that the musicians ' families the orchestral musicians ' families were no longer haydn remonstrated with the prince but to no avail so given the prince loved his music haydn thought he 'd write a symphony to make the point and we 're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now and you 'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen i 'm pleased to say the prince did take the tip from the orchestral performance and the musicians were reunited with their families but i think it sums up my talk rather well this that where there is trust there is music by extension life where there is no trust the music quite simply withers away i i"
