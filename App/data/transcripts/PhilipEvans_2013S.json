  "transcript": "talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology we tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic perhaps rather timeless i 'm going to argue that in fact business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology let me start if i may with a little bit of the idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants bruce henderson the founder of bcg and michael porter professor at the harvard business school henderson 's central idea was what you might call the napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness of overwhelming the enemy what henderson recognized was that in the business world there are many the more you do of something disproportionately the better you get and that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world but he qualified it he pointed out correctly that that 's all very well but businesses actually have multiple steps to them they have different components and each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy a company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged in others he formed the concept of the value chain essentially the sequence of steps with which a shall we say raw material becomes a component becomes assembled into a finished product and then is distributed for example and he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components and that the advantage of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average and this idea of the value chain was predicated on the on the recognition that what holds a business together is transaction costs essence you need to coordinate organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets very often it was on those two ideas henderson 's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience and porter 's idea of the value chain encompassing heterogenous elements that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected now being invalidated there are really two components to transaction costs one is about processing these are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long period of time as we all know from so many contexts they have been radically transformed since the days when porter and henderson first formulated their theories which is why communication the internet has exploded in such a dramatic fashion now those falling transaction costs have profound consequences because if transaction costs are the glue that hold value chains together and they are falling there is less to economize on and value chains at least can break up they needn 't necessarily but they can possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or disintermediate the competitor in another that is not just an abstract proposition there are many very specific stories of how that actually happened a poster child example was the encyclopedia business leatherbound books was basically a distribution business most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen internet came along new technologies made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper and the encyclopedia industry collapsed it 's now of course a very familiar story it was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation or what we call deconstruction now what 's special about the wikipedia is not its distribution what 's special about the wikipedia is the way it 's produced the wikipedia of course is now what that really meant in terms of the it turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia could do just as good a job and certainly a much cheaper job than professionals in a hierarchical organization so basically what was happening was that one layer of this value chain was becoming fragmented as individuals could take over where organizations if we go back to around two thousand a lot of people were talking about the information revolution was indeed true that the world 's stock of data was growing indeed growing quite fast but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog we go forward to two thousand and seven not only had the world 's stock of data exploded and more important even than that if you look more carefully at this graph what you will observe is that about a half of that digital data is on a server or it 's on a p c if we run the numbers forward to two thousand and twenty and what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication now if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data this just in the last ten or eleven years this i would submit is a sea change a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in the first human genome that of james watson was mapped as the culmination of the human genome project in the year two thousand and it took about two hundred million dollars and about ten years of work to map just one person 's genomic makeup since then the costs of mapping the genome have come down in fact they 've come down in recent years very dramatically indeed to the point where the cost is now below one thousand dollars and it 's confidently predicted that by the year two thousand and fifteen it will be below one hundred dollars a five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a 15 year period an extraordinary phenomenon in the days when mapping a genome cost millions or even tens of thousands but when the genome can be mapped for one hundred bucks ninety nine dollars while you wait then it becomes above all clinical you go the doctor with a cold and if he or she hasn 't done it already the first thing they do is map your genome at which point what they 're now doing is not starting from some abstract knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you but they 're starting from your particular genome now think of the power of that think of where that takes us when we can combine thing that doesn 't get much attention how is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases if your competitive advantage is defined by your data how on earth is that company or is that society in they can 't so essentially what 's happening here and genomics is merely one example of this is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a discipline is formulated the basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated oligopolistic competition among essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving by one means or another from a vertical structure to a horizontal one the plummeting of the polarization of scale economies towards the very small small is beautiful the scaling in the opposite direction towards things like big data drive the structure of business towards the creation of new kinds of institutions that can achieve but either way the typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal if we look at the pharmaceutical industry or for that matter university research you can say exactly and in the opposite direction if we look say at the energy sector where all the talk is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and efficient conservers of energy that is in fact the reverse phenomenon that is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale either way what we are driven to is this of the structure of industries implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy it means for example that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure where things like business definition and even industry and we need industry structures that will accommodate very very different motivations from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments or for that these kinds of transformations render the traditional premises of business strategy obsolete they drive us into a completely new world they require us whether we are in the public sector or the private sector to think very fundamentally differently about the structure of business"
