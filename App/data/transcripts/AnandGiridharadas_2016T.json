  "transcript": "i write to you today to you who have lost in this era at this moment i address this letter even though we both know there are many of you behind this and many of me behind this i i write to you because at present this quaking world we share i suspect we fear in common but much of what we fear seems to be each other you fear the world i want to live in and i fear your visions in turn do you know that feeling you get when you know it 's going to storm before it storms do you also feel that now fellow citizen that malaise and worry that some who know feel reminds them of the perhaps because our fears of each other are not in sync in this round i sense that your fears of me of the world that i have insisted is right for us both has gathered over a generation it took time for your fears to trigger my fears not least because at first i never thought i needed to fear you i heard you but did not listen all these years when you said that this amazing new world across the industrialized world that the open liquid world i relished of people and goods and technologies flowing freely globally i have walked through your towns and while looking failed i did notice texas that the town square was dominated by one lawyer 's office after another i did notice the barren shops in wagner south dakota and the vfw gathering hall that stood in mockery i did notice pennsylvania wal mart that far too many people in their 20s and 30s looked a decade or two from death with patchy i did notice that the young people i encountered in paris in florence in barcelona had degrees but no place to take them living on internships well into their 30s their lives prevented from launching because of an economy that creates wealth i did notice the news about those parts of london becoming ghost quarters where the global turn fishy money into empty apartments and price lifelong residents of a city young couples starting out out of their and i heard that the fabric of your life was tearing and now you couldn 't you used to be able to nourish your children and guarantee that they would climb a little bit further in life than you had and now you didn 't it and now it wasn 't i cannot say i didn 't know these things but i was even as you struggled down here on earth i was distracted even as many of you began to live shorter lives than your parents had i looked i paid attention and when your voting and shouting when the substance of it began to threaten i listened only when you moved toward shattering continental unions and electing vulgar demagogues only then did your pain become of interest to me i know that feeling hurt is often prologue to dealing hurt i wonder now if you would be less eager to deal it i ask myself why i didn 't stand with you then one reason is that i became entranced by the gurus of change became a worshiper of the religion of the new for novelty 's sake and of globalization and open borders and kaleidoscopic once change became my i could fail to see change 's consequences could overlook the importance of roots traditions rituals stability and belonging and the more fundamentalist i became in my worship of change and openness the more i drove you towards the other polarity to cling to freeze to close i now see as i didn 't before that not having the right skin or right organ is not the only varietal of disadvantage quieter disadvantage in having those privileged traits and yet feeling history to be moving away from that while the past was hospitable to people like you the future will be more hospitable to others that the world is growing less familiar less yours day by day i will not concede for a moment that old privileges should not dwindle they cannot dwindle fast enough it is for you to learn to live in a new century in which there are no bonuses for showing up with the right skin and right organs if and when your anger turns to hate please know that there is no space for that in our shared home but i will admit i have forgotten that what is socially necessary can also be personally gruelling a similar thing happened with the economy that you and i share just as i cannot and don 't wish to turn back to the clock on equality and and yet must understand so too i refuse and could not if i wished interdependent world and on inventions that won 't stop being and yet i must understand your experience of these things you have for years been telling me that your experience of these things is not as good as my theories forecast yet before you could finish a complaining sentence about the difficulty of living with erratic hours i shot back at you before you could finish your sentence my dogma about how what you are actually experiencing was flexibility language is one of the only things that we truly share and i sometimes used this joint inheritance to obfuscate and deflect and justify myself to re brand what was good for me as something appearing good for us both when i threw around terms like the sharing economy i see now that what i was really doing at times was buying your pain sprucing it up i have wanted to believe and wanted you to believe that the system that has been good to me that has made i have condescended to you with the idea that you are voting against your economic interests voting against your interests as if i know your i have a weakness for treating people 's economic interests as their only interest so here we in a scary resentment and i worry for us both if we continue down this road me not listening you feeling unheard you shouting to get me to i worry when each of us is seduced by visions of the future that have no place for the other if this goes on if this goes on there may be blood there are already hints of this blood in newspapers every day and no i do not think that i exaggerate there may be even talk of war in places that were certain they were done with it there is always the hope shallow redemption that comes through blather about us all being in it together this will take more it will take accepting that we both made choices to be here we create we witness and sometimes ignore each other into being you were not born i have some role in whatever thirst you now feel for revenge and that thirst now tempts me to plot ever more elaborate escapes from our common life from the schools and neighborhoods and airports and amusement parks that we used to share we face a problem of your and my we chose ways of relating to each other that got us starting with our own cherished versions imagine if you let go of fantasies of a society purged imagine if i let go of my habit of saving the world behind your back of deliberating on the future of your work we can do this only if we first accept that we have neglected each other if there is hope to summon in this ominous hour it is this we have for too long chased various shimmering dreams at the cost of attention to the foundational dream of each other we could dare to commit to the dream of each other as the thing that matters before every neon thing let us sincerely yours a fellow citizen"
