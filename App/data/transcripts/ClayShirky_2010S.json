  "transcript": "the story starts in kenya in december of two thousand and seven when there was a disputed presidential election and in the immediate aftermath of that election ory okolloh who some of you may know from her tedtalk who began blogging about it on her site kenyan pundit and shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence and so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was and okolloh solicited and she quickly said it 's too much if only there was a way to automate this hours they launched ushahidi ushahidi the name means witness or testimony in swahili is a very simple way aggregating it and putting it on a map that 's all it is but that 's all that 's needed because what it does takes the tacit information available to the whole population everybody knows where the violence is but no one person knows what everyone knows and that that maneuver called crisis mapping was kicked off in kenya in january of two thousand and eight and enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created ushahidi decided they were going make it open source and turn it into a platform it 's since been deployed in mexico to track electoral fraud it 's been deployed in washington d c to track snow cleanup and it 's been used most famously in haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake and when you look at the map now posted on the ushahidi front page you can see that the number of deployments in ushahidi has gone worldwide a single idea and a single implementation in east africa in the beginning of two thousand and eight to a global deployment in less than three years now what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology and the interesting moment now the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true and it represents the ability of the world 's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large sometimes global projects cognitive surplus is made up of two things the first obviously is the world 's free time and talents the world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects that 's the second half of cognitive surplus the media landscape what we 're seeing is that people weren 't couch potatoes because we liked to be but it turns out we also like to create and it 's those two things together ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large scale efforts that are the new the new design resource also getting of course a lot of lolcats lolcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions and they are also part of the abundant media landscape we 're getting now this is one of the participatory now i want to stipulate as the lawyers say but here 's the thing the stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act someone who has done something like this however mediocre and throwaway and they could work on getting it better there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work and as anybody who 's worked as an artist or a creator knows it 's a spectrum you 're constantly struggling to get on top of the gap and someone who makes a lolcat has already crossed over that gap now it 's tempting to want to get the ushahidis without the lolcats right to get the serious stuff stuff without the throwaway stuff but media abundance never works that way freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything even with the sacred printing press we got erotic novels one hundred and fifty years before we got scientific journals so before i talk about what is i think the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi i want to talk about their shared shared source and that source is design for generosity it is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around social sciences are also starting how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them or because we 're being paid to do them this is a graph from a paper by uri gneezy and aldo rustichini who set out to test at the beginning of this decade what they called deterrence if you want somebody to do less of something add a punishment and they 'll do less of it they studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension which is pick up time so gneezy and rustichini said how many instances of late pick ups are there at these ten daycare centers now they saw and this is what the graph is these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals that there were between six and ten instances of late pick ups on average in these ten daycare centers the white group there is the control group they change nothing the group of daycare centers represented by the black line they said we are changing this bargain as of right now boom no ifs ands or buts and the minute they did that the behavior in those daycare centers changed late pick ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre fine average for the life of the fine and you can see immediately what happened right the fine broke the culture of the daycare center by adding a fine what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of what could be bad laughter the explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the 20th century was that we are all rational and in that explanation the daycare center had no contract should have been operating but that 's not right they were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones and critically the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did so gneezy and rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks run run the fine for a dozen the culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations that incompatibility can persist over long in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you 're relying on the economic part of the bargain as with the the parents paying the teachers and when you 're relying on the social part of the bargain when you 're really designing for generosity this brings me back to the lolcats and to ushahidi this is i think the range that matters both of these rely on cognitive surplus both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we here is the critical difference between these lolcats is communal value it 's value created by the participants for each other communal value on the networks we have is is everywhere every time you see a large aggregate of shared publicly available data whether it 's photos on flickr or videos but this is also a largely solved problem i have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying where oh where can i find a picture of a cute cat ushahidi by is civic value it 's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole the goals set out by ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants but to make life better for everyone in the society in which ushahidi is operating and that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human there are a trillion and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead a very different model than our default model for large scale group action in the 20th century what and to the degree we 're going to do that to the degree we 're able to do that we 'll be able to change society"
