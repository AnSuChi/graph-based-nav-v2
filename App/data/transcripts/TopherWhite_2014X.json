  "transcript": "i visited the rainforests of borneo for the very first time it was the overwhelming sounds of the forest that struck me the most there 's this constant cacophony of noise actually singing to each other over a great distance but in fact the most important noise that was coming out of the forest that time was one that i didn 't notice and in fact nobody there had actually noticed it they spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons and so if we take the sound of the forest and we actually turn down the gibbons the insects and the rest in the background the entire time in recordings you heard was the sound of a chainsaw they had three full time guards who were posted posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against we stumbled upon because as you heard the forest is very very loud it as quite unacceptable that in this modern time just a few hundred meters away from a ranger station so how do we stop illegal logging it 's really tempting as an engineer always to come up with a and so what we also noticed while were there we could build a system that would allow us to stop this using what 's already there but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest the real surprise this is the big one was that there was connectivity out in the forest there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere we 're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road there 's but you have to have a device to go up in the trees so if we can use but let 's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest because it 's something that we 've definitely all heard about forever people in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest since we were kids deforestation accounts more greenhouse gas than all of the world 's planes trains cars trucks and ships combined it 's the second highest contributor to climate change also according to interpol as much as ninety percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging so if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there then in fact we could eat heavily into this seventeen percent and potentially have a major impact in the short term be the cheapest fastest way to fight climate change and so here 's the system that we imagine it looks super high tech the moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw it sends an alert through the standard gsm network that 's already there to a ranger in the field who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging it 's no more about going out and finding a tree that 's been cut actually as you saw they weren 't able to do it so it may not be so cheap and fast it could be pretty cheap cell phones are thrown away the hundreds of millions every year hundreds of millions in the u s alone not counting the rest of the world which of course powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy any sort of solar power under a tree canopy was which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process these are strips so this is me putting it all together this is a device up in a tree what you can see from here allowing them to cover about three square kilometers if someone were to take them so we took it back to not the same place but another place to another gibbon reserve that was threatened daily by illegal logging and in fact you can hear the chainsaw really really faint in the background but no one had noticed it until that moment this is the moment where we 've actually arrived close to where the loggers are this is the moment where you can see where i 'm actually regretting perhaps the entire endeavor i 'm not really sure what 's on the other side of this hill that guy 's much braver than i am and interrupted the loggers in the act for them it was such a surprise they had never ever been interrupted before that it was such an impressive event for them that we 've heard from our partners they have not been back since and what they really convinced us on the spot was that if it 's enough of a deterrent they won 't come back so thank you possibly because we told a lot of people then some really amazing stuff started to happen people from around the world started to send us emails phone calls what we saw was that people throughout asia people throughout and what 's most important what we 'd found that we thought might be exceptional so in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground people who are already there and if the rest of the device can be completely recycled then we believe it 's an entirely upcycled device this didn 't come because of any sort of and i 'm thoroughly convinced that if it 's not phones that there 's always going to be enough there that you can build similar solutions that can be very effective in new contexts thank you very much"
