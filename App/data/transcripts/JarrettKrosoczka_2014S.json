  "transcript": "and when i was setting up my slide projector i looked across the room and there she was my old lunch lady so i approached her to say hello and i said hi jeannie how are you and she looked at me and i could tell that she recognized me but she couldn 't quite place me and she looked at me and she said stephen and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid and she started telling me about her grandkids and that blew my mind my lunch lady had grandkids and therefore kids and therefore left school at the end of the day i thought she lived in the cafeteria with the serving spoons i had never thought about any of that before well that chance encounter inspired my imagination and i created the lunch lady graphic novel series a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes and they proclaim and they sent me the most amazing letters and cards and artwork and because the lunch lady has not been treated very kindly in popular culture over time and in front of everyone there everyone she had fed over the years i gave her a piece of artwork and some books and i attended her wake and nothing could have prepared me for what i saw there because next to her casket was this painting and her husband told me it meant so much to her i had validated what she did and that inspired me to create a day where we could recreate that feeling in cafeterias across the country and the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray there is ms brenda in sixty seven percent and they made thank you pizzas where every kid signed a different topping of a construction paper pizza i was so moved by the response i felt like i was at the end of the planet at this school i didn 't think that anyone noticed us down here another woman said to me you know what i got out of this is that what i do is important and of course what she does is and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educated society so i hope and i hope that you remember how powerful a thank you can be a thank you can change a life and it changes the life of the person who expresses it thank you"
