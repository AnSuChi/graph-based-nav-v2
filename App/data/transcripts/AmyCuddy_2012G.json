  "transcript": "i want to ask you to body and what you 're doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller maybe you 're hunching crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold onto our arms like this sometimes we spread out i see you so i want you to pay attention to what you 're doing right and i 'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds and we 're particularly interested in other people 's body language you know we 're interested in like you know laughter an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward or maybe even something like a handshake narrator here they are arriving at number ten this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states here comes the prime minister weeks and weeks and weeks even the bbc and the new york times so obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language but we call it nonverbals as social scientists so what is your body language communicating to me what 's mine communicating to this is a valid way to look at this so social scientists have spent a lot of time and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote who we ask out on a date for nalini ambady a researcher at tufts university shows that when people watch soundless clips of real interactions their judgments of the physician 's niceness so it doesn 't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted even more dramatic alex todorov at princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates ' faces in just one second predict seventy percent of u s senate and gubernatorial race outcomes and even let 's go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation if you use them poorly bad idea when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are we tend to forget though the other audience that 's influenced by our nonverbals and that 's ourselves so power dynamics i became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance you take up space you 're basically and this is true across the animal kingdom it 's not just limited to primates and humans do the same thing and also when they 're feeling powerful in the moment and this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite so what we tend to do we don 't mirror them we do the opposite of them so i 'm watching this behavior in the classroom what do i notice i notice that mba students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals so you have people who are like caricatures of alphas really coming into the room they get right into the middle of the room when they sit down they 're sort of spread out they raise their hands like this you have other people who are virtually collapsing and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand i notice a couple of things about this one you 're not going to be surprised it seems to be related to gender so women are much more likely to do this kind of than men women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating and this is really important in the mba classroom because participation counts for half the grade so business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap you get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades and it to be partly attributable to participation so you have these people coming in like this and they 're participating is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more so and i really wanted to know like can you do this just for a little while so we know that our nonverbals there 's some evidence that they do so for example when it comes to power but it 's also possible that when you when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that that our bodies change our minds and when i say minds in the case of the powerful what am i talking about so i 'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case that 's so powerful people they actually feel they 're going to win even at games of chance they also tend to be able to think more abstractly so there are a lot of differences they take more risks there are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people so what we find is that and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol but really power is also about how you react to stress so do you want the high power leader but not very stress reactive the person who 's laid back we know that in primate hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level so what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention for two minutes you say i want you to stand like this and it 's going to make you feel more powerful so we decided to bring just going to show you five of the poses although they took on only two so here 's one a so we then ask them and then we give them an opportunity to gamble so this is what we find risk tolerance which is the gambling we find that when you are in the high power pose condition eighty six percent of you will gamble when you 're in the low power pose condition only sixty percent and that 's a whopping significant difference here 's what we find on testosterone from their baseline when they come in high power people experience about a 20 percent increase and you get these changes here 's what you get on cortisol high power people experience about a so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really so it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so it 's not just others but it 's also ourselves this is in the lab it 's this little task it 's just a couple of minutes which we cared about of course and so we think situations where are you being evaluated either by your friends for teenagers it 's at the lunchroom table for some people it 's speaking at a school board meeting it might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or so we published these okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right you know so we were of course horrified and said oh my god no that 's not what we meant at all for numerous reasons no don 't do that again this is not about you talking to other people it 's you talking to yourself what do you do before you go into a job interview you you 're sitting down you 're looking at your iphone or your android not trying to leave anyone out so that 's what we want to test okay so we bring people into a lab and they do either high or low power poses again they go through a very stressful job interview it 's five minutes long they are being recorded they 're being judged also and the judges so they look like this imagine this is the person interviewing you and this is worse than being heckled people hate this it 's what marianne lafrance calls standing in social quicksand so this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened and they they end up looking at these sets of tapes and they say we want to hire these people all the high power posers we don 't want to hire these people we also evaluate these people much more positively overall it 's about the presence that they 're bringing to the speech because we rate them on all these variables related to competence how well structured is the speech how good is it what are their qualifications no effect on those things this is what 's affected these kinds of things so when i tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me i don 't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud and that really resonated with me because i want to tell you a little story about and i had been which was i knew my iq because i had identified with being smart and i had been called gifted as a child just there are other things for you to do but that 's not going to work out for you having your identity taken from you your core identity and for me it was being smart having that taken from you there 's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that eventually i graduated from college it and i convinced someone my i am an impostor and the night before my first year talk and the first year talk at princeton is a 20 minute talk to twenty people that 's it i was so afraid of being found out the next day that i called her and said i 'm and this is what you 're going to do even if you 're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out of body experience until you have this moment where you say ' oh my gosh i 'm doing it like i have become this i but for a long time i had been thinking not supposed to be here so at the end of my first year at harvard a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who i had said look you 've gotta participate or else you 're going to fail came into my office i really didn 't know her at all she said i 'm not supposed to be here and that was the moment for me because two things happened one was that i realized oh my gosh i don 't feel like that anymore i don 't feel that anymore but she does and i get that feeling and the second was she is supposed to be here like she can fake it she can become it and tomorrow you 're going to fake it you 're going to make yourself powerful and you know and you 're going to go and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around and were like oh my god i didn 't even notice her sitting there she comes back to me months later and i realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it so she had changed fake it till you become it do it enough until you actually become it and internalize last thing i 'm going to leave you with is this tiny tweaks so before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation configure your brain to cope the best in that situation get your testosterone up get your cortisol down don 't leave that situation feeling like i don 't have ego involved in this give it away and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life thank you"
