  "transcript": "two thousand and seven i decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing now we 're a long way away from that goal right now there are billions of people in developing countries so we could easily supply the world now imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them the other half aren 't there yet you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments but you know what you 'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of so it 's extremely hard to do all of those additions but you could go out someplace brand new build a brand new so i proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and they wanted to ask what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras at one point javier said to octavio what if we took some of our empty land what if we just gave it to an embassy give some to the u s embassy give some to the the canadian embassy and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states they can go get jobs do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u s to do in the summer of two thousand and nine honduras went through a wrenching pepe lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised he asked octavio to be his chief of staff trial and error a lot of user testing i tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials the first point was the importance of rules like those rules that say you can 't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders and it 's usually the rules that hold us back in the fall of two thousand and ten a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk they called me they said let 's present this to the to the leaders of our country so in december we met in miami in a hotel conference room i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are how much more valuable they are than they cost and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city notice land that 's worth thousands and at some point when there was a pause octavio said paul maybe we could watch the tedtalk laughing so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land a charter so i was asked by the the president of honduras so i presented lecture that included a slide like this which tried to make the point that if you want to create a lot of value in a city it has to be very big so i was trying to persuade the hondurans if you build a new city you 've got to start with a site that 's at least one thousand square kilometers 's more than two hundred and fifty hundred thousand acres everybody applauded politely the faces in the audience were very serious i 've got it here on my laptop because the leaders in the government there in honduras would need help from partner countries who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced and the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust we went and looked at a site this picture 's from there it easily could hold and shortly thereafter on january 19th they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was one hundred and twenty four to one all parties all factions in society backed this 17th they passed it again with another vote of one hundred and fourteen to one immediately after that vote on february 21st to the 24th a delegation of about thirty hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business one is south korea this is a picture of a big new city center that 's being built in south korea bigger than downtown boston everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the permits they 've actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third here 's where we are they 've got a site they 're already thinking about this site for the second city they 're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in and also an external legal system one country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there but the one thing you know they 've already solved is that there 's lots of tenants there 's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas and there 's lots of people who 'd like to go there many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing sadly sometimes there are even children who so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in honduras or to build a dozen of these or a hundred of these around the world what kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents this is an idea worth spreading and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you ted"
