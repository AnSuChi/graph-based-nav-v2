  "transcript": "so i am going to give you some attempt today to try and explain to you what i do so dancing is one of the most human of activities we delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on now ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of sadly neurological disorders such as parkinson 's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary as it is doing to my friend jan stripling who was so great progress and treatment has been made over the years however there are six point three million people worldwide who have the disease rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it 's too late we need to be able to measure progression objectively and that means that outside the clinical trials it 's just never done but what if patients could do this test at home now that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic and what if so what i want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this because you see in one sense at least we are all virtuosos like my friend jan stripling so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds now this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers i mean just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak from the sound we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates so we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease so these voice based tests how do they stack up against expert clinical tests and they 're both accurate okay but in addition voice based tests are non expert that means they can be ultra low cost it becomes massively scalable we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup we can do high frequency monitoring to get objective data low cost mass recruitment for clinical trials and we can make population scale screening feasible for the first time we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late so taking the first steps towards this today we 're launching the parkinson 's voice initiative with aculab and patientslikeme 're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet anyone healthy or with parkinson 's can call in thank by taking all these samples of let 's say ten thousand people you 'll be able to tell who 's healthy and who 's not what are you going to get out of those samples max little yeah yeah so what will happen is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the you see some people may not do it they may not get through it but we 'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances and looking for the actual markers of the disease tr so you 're eighty six percent accurate right now ml it 's much better than that actually my student thanasis i have to plug him because he 's done some fantastic work and now he and people with parkinson 's could call in record their voice and then their doctor can check up on their progress see where they 're doing in this course of the disease"
