  "transcript": "khan academy is most known for its its collection of videos so before i go any further let me show you a little bit of a montage salman khan so the hypotenuse is now going to be five this animal 's fossils are only found in this area of south america a nice clean band here and national assembly they create the committee of public safety which and it 's an alcohol start differentiating into effector and memory cells a galaxy hey there then you have no emotion sk we now have on the order of two thousand two hundred videos covering everything from basic arithmetic all the way to to vector calculus and some of the stuff that you saw we have but before i do that i want to talk a little bit about really just how i got started and some of you all and i started putting the first youtube videos up really just as a kind of nice to have just kind of a supplement for my cousins something that might give give them a refresher or something happened the first the feedback from my cousins they told me that they preferred me on youtube than in person and once you get over the backhanded nature of that there was actually something very profound there they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin at first it 's very unintuitive but when you think about it from their point of view it makes a ton of sense you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin without feeling like they 're wasting my time if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago they don 't have to be embarrassed and and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if they 're bored of this is the notion that the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this and that 's what was happening with the the interaction with my cousins before and now they can just do it in the other thing that happened is i put them on youtube just just i saw no reason to make it private so i i let other people watch it and then people started stumbling on it and i started getting some comments and some letters and and all sorts of feedback from from random people around the world these are just a few this is actually from one of the original calculus videos someone wrote it on youtube it was a youtube comment first time i smiled doing a derivative and then they smiled in response to that same comment this is on the thread you can go on youtube and look at the comments since i remember seeing all of this matrix text in class and here i 'm all like ' i know kung fu ' we get a lot of feedback along those lines this clearly was helping people but then as the viewership kept growing and kept growing i started getting letters from from people and it was starting to become clear that it was more than just a nice to have this is just an excerpt from one of one of those letters my twelve year old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math and it got through he is so excited and so you can imagine was an analyst at a hedge fund it was very strange for me to do something of social value and then a few other but that this content will never grow old that it could help their kids if isaac newton had done youtube videos on calculus assuming he was good we don 't know the other thing that happened and even at this point i said ok maybe it 's a good supplement it 's good for motivated students it 's good for maybe home schoolers but i didn 't think it would somehow penetrate the classroom then i started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying we 've used your videos to flip the classroom you 've given the lectures so now what we do and this could happen in every classroom in america tomorrow and what used to be homework now have the students doing in the classroom and i want to pause here i want to pause here because there 's a couple of interesting things one when those teachers are doing that there 's the obvious benefit the benefit that now their their students can enjoy the videos in the way that my cousins did they can pause repeat at their own pace but the more interesting thing and this is the unintuitive thing when you talk about technology in the classroom by removing the and letting students have a self paced lecture at home these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom they took a fundamentally dehumanizing experience thirty kids with their fingers on their lips not allowed to interact with each other a teacher no matter how good has to give this one size fits all lecture to thirty students so once the khan academy i quit my job and we turned into a real organization we 're a not for profit the question is how do we take this to the next level how do we take what those teachers were doing to its natural conclusion and so what i 'm showing over here these are actual until you get ten in a row and the khan academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you don 't know how to do it homework then you build on that in the next concept that 's analogous to imagine learning to ride a bicycle maybe i give you a lecture ahead of time and i give you a bicycle for two weeks then i come back after two weeks and say well let 's see you 're having trouble taking left turns you can 't quite stop you 're an eighty percent bicyclist so i put a big c stamp on your forehead and then i say here 's a unicycle but as ridiculous as that sounds that 's exactly what 's happening in our in our classrooms right now and the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of the sudden and start despite being smart despite having good teachers and it 's usually because they have these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation so our our model is until you have this is shifting and reflecting functions and they all fit together we have about ninety of these right now you can go to the site right now it 's all free not trying to sell anything but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map that top node right there that 's literally single digit addition it 's like one plus one is equal to two the paradigm is once you get ten in a row on that it keeps forwarding you to more and more advanced modules further down you start getting into algebra one algebra two a little bit of precalculus everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on you have genetics all based off of that core of if you know this and that now you 're ready for this next concept and i encourage you to do it with your kids but i also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself it 'll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what i 'm showing you here this is data from a pilot in the los altos school district where they took two fifth grade classes i want and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the every kid works at their own pace this is actually a live dashboard from the los altos school district and they look at this dashboard red means they 're stuck and what the teacher does is literally just say let me intervene on the red kids or even better let me get one of the green kids who are already proficient in that concept to be the first line of attack and actually tutor their peer now data centric reality so we don 't want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions you understand and all the rest in finance marketing manufacturing so the teachers can diagnose what 's wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to how long they 've spent each day what what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they focused on the outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on the inner circle shows the videos they 're focused on and you can see eventually they were able to get ten in a row it 's almost like you can see them learning over those last ten problems they also got faster the height is how long it took them when you talk about self paced learning it makes sense for everyone in education speak differentiated learning because every every time we 've done this in every classroom we 've done there 's a group of kids who 've raced ahead and a group who are a little bit slower these are the slow kids maybe they should be tracked differently maybe we should put them in different classes but when you let students work at their own pace we see it over and over and over again but once they get through that concept they just race ahead and so the same kids that you thought were slow you now would think are gifted and we 're seeing it over and over and over again it makes you really wonder how much all of the labels maybe a lot of us have benefited from were really just due to a coincidence of time now as valuable as something like this is in a district like los altos our goal is is to use technology to humanize not just in los altos but on a global scale what 's happening in education and that that a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student to teacher ratios in our mind the relevant metric is so in a traditional model most of the teacher 's time is spent doing lectures and grading and whatnot maybe five percent of their time is sitting next to students and working with them you 're humanizing the classroom i 'd argue by a factor of five or ten as valuable as that is in los altos imagine what it does to the adult learner who 's embarrassed to go back and learn stuff they should have known before before going back to imagine what it does to a street kid in calcutta who has to help his family during the day and that 's the reason he or she can 't go to school now they can spend two hours a day and remediate or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or or don 't know now imagine what happens where we talked about the peers teaching each other but this is all one system there 's no reason why you can 't have that imagine what happens if and i think what you 'll see emerging is this notion of thank you tell me i 'm still doing all the videos but we have a rock star team doing the software you get points it 's actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the badging or how many points you get for doing something we see on a system wide basis like tens of thousands of going one direction or another depending what badge you give them bg how did that come about sk los altos it was kind of crazy once again i didn 't expect it to be used in classrooms someone from from their board came and said what would you do if you had carte blanche in a classroom something like this we 'd give a dashboard they said this is kind of radical we have to think about it me and the rest of the team were like they 're never going to want to do this but literally the next day they were like can you start in two weeks only in school on christmas we saw some of the kids were doing it we can track everything track them as they go through the entire district through the summers as they go from one teacher to the next you have this continuity of of data that that even at the district level they can see bg so you 're getting feedback on those teacher views to see what they think they need most of those were were specs by the teachers we made some of those for students so they could see their data but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and this is nice but like that focus graph a lot of the teachers said i have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus diagram it 's ready we 've got a million people on the site already so we can handle a few more laughter no no reason why why it really can 't happen in every classroom in america tomorrow bg and the vision of the tutoring thing the idea there is if i 'm confused about a topic somehow right in the user interface and i could schedule and connect up with those people sk absolutely and this is something i recommend everyone in this audience do those dashboards the teachers have you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for your your kids your nephews your cousins or maybe some kids at the boys and girls club really immediately but yeah it 's all there bg well it 's amazing i think you just got a glimpse of the future of education"
