  "transcript": "my name is joshua walters i 'm a performer i 'm also diagnosed bipolar i reframe that as a positive because the crazier i get onstage the more entertaining i become was sixteen in san francisco i had my breakthrough manic episode in which i thought i was jesus christ maybe you thought that was scary but actually there 's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you 're jesus christ laughter i was sent to a place everyone is doing their own there 's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time they 're just practicing one day they 'll get here now when i got out i was diagnosed and i was given medications by a psychiatrist of you are in the field i can see i can feel your noise the first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs where i was sleeping through high school the second half was just one big nap pretty much in class out i had a choice i could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness there 's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive at least the hypomanic edge part of it now if you don 't know what hypomania is it 's like many of you in the audience have that creative edge if you know what i 'm talking about you 're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible and there 's a book john gartner john gartner wrote this book called the hypomanic edge in which christopher columbus and ted turner and steve jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete touched with fire by kay redfield jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which mozart and beethoven and van gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with some of them committed suicide so it wasn 't all there 's been development in this field and there was an article written in the new york times september two thousand and ten that stated just manic just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum but they 're in the bipolar spectrum where on one side maybe and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money so maybe you know there 's no such thing and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn 't mean you 're crazy but maybe it just means you 're more sensitive to what most people can 't see or feel maybe everyone is just a little bit mad how much depends on where you fall in the spectrum how much depends on how lucky you are"
