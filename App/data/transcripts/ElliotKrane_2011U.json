  "transcript": "pediatrician and an anesthesiologist so i put children to sleep for a living and i 'm an academic so i put audiences to sleep for free and it 's from the experience from about twenty or twenty five years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning now most of the time you think of pain as a symptom of a disease and that 's true most of the time it 's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation but about ten percent of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists it persists for and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients now i want you to imagine that i 'm stroking it with this please keep your seat these two ideas together imagine what your life would be like but your brain was telling you in fact imagine something even worse imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather and their brain [ was ] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch she was sixteen years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person 's life but in chandler 's case that was the beginning of the story this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain purplish in color it was cadaverically cold to the touch the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that but the worst part was not the spontaneous pain that was there twenty four hours a day the lightest touch of her arm how can the nervous system get this so wrong how can the nervous system an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and when you turn the switch on the light goes on and when you turn the switch off so people imagine the nervous system is just like that if you hit your thumb with a hammer these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one on one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions these cells called glial cells but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role amplification in the case of pain the distortion of sensory experiences these glial cells become activated their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and until what we have is a positive feedback loop it 's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off and that 's why pain becomes its own disease the nervous system has plasticity it changes and it morphs in well what do we do about that what can we do in a case like chandler 's we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time we treat them with and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics and most importantly what we do is we use a and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally despair and but the future is actually even brighter the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not but that will be drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate that spill over and cause this central nervous system no pain thank you very much"
