  "transcript": "in the new york times modern love column in january of this year to fall in love with anyone do this and my own experience trying the study myself one so the procedure is fairly simple two strangers take turns asking each other thirty six increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other 's eyes without speaking for four minutes so here are a couple of sample questions number number thirty i really like this one tell your partner what you like about them be very honest this so when i first came across this study a few years earlier and they 'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony so i was of course very skeptical but then we did and so i sent it to the modern and the reason i think you might be wondering this is because i have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months and this question is really what i want to talk about today but let 's come back to it so i had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog and i and by saturday this had happened to the traffic on my blog and i was to say the least underprepared for this sort of attention it 's one thing but it is another thing to discover that your love life has made international news and to realize that people across the world are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship and when people called or emailed which they did every day for weeks they always asked the same question first are you guys still together they were from students and journalists and friendly strangers like this one i even gave a talk and one woman shouted up to the stage i understand that this is part of the deal but i just wasn 't prepared for the scope of the response the thirty six questions seem to have taken on a life of their own in fact york times which featured readers ' experiences of trying the study themselves with varying degrees of success so my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship i turned down tv interviews and i said no to every request for photos of the two us and they wanted to know if it really worked that is if it was capable of producing love that would last but this was a question i didn 't feel capable of answering and i felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place if the answer was no would it make the experience of doing these thirty six questions any less worthwhile dr arthur aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in and several subsequent studies have also used aron 's fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers the one that i tried last summer that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact was referenced in this article but unfortunately it was never published i was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college and a student came up to me afterwards and he said kind of shyly and it didn 't work he seemed a little mystified by this you mean you didn 't fall in love with the person you did it with i asked well he paused i think she just wants to be friends but did you become better friends i asked did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study he nodded so then it worked think this is the answer he was looking for which was basically my entire adult life and he was my first real love and i had no idea how or if i could make a life i don 't know if i realized this at the time i hoped that if i i might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as i did then and all this knowledge has been useful in some ways i and i can see see that what i want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for what i want from love is a guarantee but that i will continue to be loved by the person i love maybe it 's this possibility of a guarantee that but it 's also terrifying and i think this is the thing that most of us really want from love to be known to be seen to be understood we are too willing to accept the short version of the story the version of the story that asks are you still together and is content with a yes or no answer so rather than that question i would propose we ask some more difficult questions questions like how do you decide who deserves your love and who does not and how do you know when to just cut and run how do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship or even harder how do you live with your partner 's doubt but i think they 're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone so if you want it an acquaintance and i did a study and i am so glad so at the end of my article i wrote love didn 't happen to us we 're in love because we each made the choice to be and i cringe a little when i read that now not because it isn 't true but because at the time i really hadn 't considered everything that was contained in that choice and how many times i will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me i want it to be enough to have asked and answered to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun and to have broadcast that choice but what i have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of myth i don 't quite believe in and what i want what perhaps i will spend my life wanting is for that myth to be true the only part of the article that i didn 't actually write and it is terrifying but that 's the deal with love"
