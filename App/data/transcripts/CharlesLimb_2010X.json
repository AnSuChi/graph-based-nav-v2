  "transcript": "and i have never had a patient tell me i really want you to be creative during surgery i will say though that this deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and to study the science of sound particularly music i 'm going to talk over the next few minutes about about my career in terms of how i 'm able to study music and try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative i 've done most of this work at johns hopkins university and at the national institute of health where i was previously i 'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments i will start off by playing a video for you this video is of keith jarrett who 's a well known jazz improviser and probably the most well known iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a higher level and he 'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head so as a form of intense creativity i think this is a great example the i 've always as a listener as a fan i listen to that and i 'm astounded i think how can this possibly be and so i set out with this concept scientifically that i took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process and i put there is it possible to study creativity scientifically and i think that 's a good question and i 'll tell you that most they 're very dense and when you go through them it 's very hard to recognize the music in it in fact they seem to be unmusical entirely and to miss the point of the music this brings the second question why should scientists study creativity maybe we 're not the right people to do it well but i will say that from a scientific perspective we talked a lot about innovation today the science of innovation how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy and truly we know very little about how we are able to be creative i think that we 're going to see over the next ten twenty thirty years a real science of creativity that 's burgeoning and is going to flourish because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process like complex jazz improvisation and study it rigorously all of us have this remarkable brain which is poorly understood to say the least i think that neuroscientists i 'm not going to give you answers today just ask a lot of questions and that 's what i do in my lab i ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this this is the main method that i use this is functional mri if you 've been in an mri scanner it 's very much the same but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain the way that 's done is by the following there 's something called bold imaging which is blood oxygen level dependent imaging when you 're in an fmri scanner you 're in a big magnet that 's aligning your molecules in certain areas meaning a neural area is active it gets blood flow shunted to that area that blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by mri whereas oxyhemoglobin can 't and it 's been used since the ' 90s to study really complex processes i 'm going to review a study that i did which was jazz in an fmri scanner this is a short video of how we did this project midi signal or a musical instrument digital interface through these wires into the box and so what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard you can 't just experiment really rests on the following what happens in the brain during something that 's memorized and over learned and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated or improvised in a way that 's matched motorically and in terms of lower level sensory motor features i have here what we call the paradigms there 's a scale paradigm which is playing a scale up and down memorized then there 's improvising on a scale quarter notes metronome right hand but musically really boring then there 's the bottom one which is called the jazz paradigm so we brought professional jazz players to the nih and we had them memorize this piece of music on the lower left which is what you heard me playing lower right sound icon that 's an example of what was recorded in and that was not what was going on and then we looked at the brain activity i will try to condense this for you these are contrast maps and in blue is this area that was deactivated so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity we had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity i 'll but we have this combination of an area that 's thought to be involved in self monitoring turning off and this area that 's thought to be autobiographical or self expressive turning on we think at least in this preliminary it 's one study it 's probably wrong but it 's one study we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that to be creative one area turns on and a big area shuts off so that you 're not inhibited you 're willing to make mistakes so that you 're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses now the next question was what happens when so and i 've broken it down into four bar groups so you would know how you would trade we brought a musician into the scanner same way had them memorize this melody then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively in the control room here playing back and forth a pretty good representation of of what it 's like and it 's good that it 's not too quick the fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings so the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing looking at my hands through two mirrors so what you 're seeing here and i 'm doing a cardinal sin in science which is to show you preliminary data his language areas lit up his broca 's area in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left he had it also homologous on the right this is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication 're getting all the data together hopefully we 'll have something to say about it meaningfully i 've always been fascinated by freestyle and let 's play this video rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve so how do you study rap and my colleagues think i 'm crazy but i think it 's very viable this is what you do you have a freestyle artist come and memorize a rap that you write for them that they 've never heard before and then you have them freestyle so i told my lab members that i would rap for ted and they said this is what they memorized dressed psychopathic words in my head appear whisper these lyrics only i can hear computer art cl the art of discovering and that which is hovering inside the mind of those unconfined all of these words keep pouring out like rain i need a mad scientist to check my brain i guarantee you that will never happen again laughter so now what 's great about these free stylers they will get cued different words they don 't know what 's coming but they 'll hear something off the cuff go hit that right sound icon a short video of how we four rappers ' brains and we do see language areas lighting up but then eyes closed when you are freestyling vs memorizing you 've got major visual areas lighting a lot of questions"
