  "transcript": "this cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the eastern congo it 's mined by armed gangs using some components and ended up in a factory in shinjin in china that factory over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year we all love chocolate we buy it for our kids eighty percent of the cocoa comes from cote d 'ivoire and ghana and it 's harvested by children children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations heparin a blood thinner a pharmaceutical product starts out in artisanal workshops like this in china because the active ingredient comes from pigs ' intestines your diamond you 've all heard probably seen the movie diamond this is a mine in zimbabwe cotton uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on earth every year when it comes to the cotton harvest the puts the kids in buses buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton it 's forced child labor those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila these places these origins represent governance gaps that 's the politest description i have for them these are the dark pools where global supply chains begin the global supply chains which bring us our favorite brand name products some these governance gaps are run by some of them are not states anymore at all they 're failed states some of them are just promote trade either way they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma i know that none of us want to be accessories after the fact of a human rights abuse most of the companies involved in these supply chains don 't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product now i didn 't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain we need a reality check we need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have this is an independent republic probably a failed state it 's definitely not a that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption now that 's not a new story you 've seen the documentaries of sweatshops meet me at madison square garden but take the example of heparin it 's a pharmaceutical product you expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital probably squeaky clean the problem is that the active ingredient in there as i mentioned earlier comes from pigs the main american manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to china because it 's the world 's biggest supplier of pigs and their factory in china which probably is pretty clean where families slaughter pigs and extract the ingredient so a couple of years ago we had a scandal which killed about eighty people around the world some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product whereas real heparin problem was that it killed more people how did the chinese state agency for food and drugs allow this to happen and the answer is quite simple the chinese define these facilities as chemical they actually do conduct a few investigations overseas about a dozen a year maybe twenty in a good year there are five hundred of these facilities producing active ingredients in china alone in fact about eighty percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore india and we don 't have a governance system we don 't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is national level and we work in about sixty different countries at a national level we 've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil and so governments who are failing who are dropping the ball at a national level have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level and you can just look at the headlines take copenhagen last year complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge take the g20 meeting a couple of weeks ago stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago you can take any one of the major global challenges we 've discussed this week and ask yourself where is the leadership from governments responses to those international problems and the simple answer is they can 't they 're national their voters are local they have parochial interests they can 't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good so if we 're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level in this case in the global supply chain we have to come up with a different we need a different machine fortunately we have some examples in the and eventually president clinton in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six convened a meeting at the white house invited industry human rights ngos trade unions the department of labor got them all in a room and said look i don 't want globalization to be a race to the bottom know how to prevent that but i 'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together and they spent about three years they 're not legally liable everybody else at the table said folks that doesn 't cut it you have a custodial duty a duty of care to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it without fear of our safety or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product agreed okay what we 'll do code of conduct we 'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control we 'll make it part of the contract because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract and let 's face it the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in india or china has much more persuasive value the local human rights standards those factories will probably never see an inspector if the inspector did come along if they were able to and they cited those facilities for their but you lose that contract for a major brand name that 's the difference between staying that makes a difference so what we 've been able to do is we 've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain that of the multinational company and get them to do the right thing get them to use that power for good to deliver the key public goods they know how to deliver that product they 're not there sit down without fear of judgment without recrimination to actually face the problem agree on the problem the lack of confidence the lack of partnership between ngos campaign groups civil society organizations and multinational companies if we can put those two together in a safe space get them to work together we can deliver public goods right now or in extremely short supply and it 's crazy bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in dhaka dollars a month your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of i know there 's going to be disbelief you 'll say how can we trust them well we don 't it 's the old arms control phrase trust but verify we send inspectors on an unannounced basis and then we publish the results transparency is absolutely critical to this you can call yourself responsible but responsibility without accountability often doesn 't work so what we 're doing is we 're not only enlisting the multinationals we 're giving them the tools to deliver this public good respect for human rights ask yourself is this company behaving in a socially responsible way can i buy that product without compromising i hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and i can 't get used to the idea that the will of government so we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure we 're now thinking that this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges call it network governance call it what you will the private actors companies and ngos are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face look at the health systems in so many countries do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic no absolutely agree that 's what we 're trying to provide i know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume you want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain there are thousands of suppliers in there it seems too daunting too dangerous for any company to take on but there are companies we have four thousand companies who are members the sporting goods industry in particular stepped up to the plate and have done it it seems overwhelming the numbers just make you want to zone out but we break it down to some basic realities and human rights comes down to a very simple proposition can i give this person their dignity back poor people people whose human rights have been violated the crux of that i was sitting in a slum outside gurgaon just next to delhi one of the and i asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands please ask them to treat us like human beings that 's my simple proposition to you my simple plea to every decision maker in this we can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped if we don 't do it and i know that 's not a place we want to be and we don 't have to be there so i appeal to you thank you very much"
