  "transcript": "some introductions my mom jennie took this picture that 's my dad frank in the middle and on his john patrick 's sitting on his lap and kevin michael 's on his right susan diane me we had nearly run out of middle it was a long deliberation before we finally settled on jennifer bridget every parent in this audience knows the joy and i was excited and thrilled to help my mom in that special ceremonial moment parents delay picking the names for their new babies by a month or more why delay why not take advantage of this special ceremonial time delay because they 're afraid and this loss might be a little more bearable without a name a face without a name so here we are in one part of the world a time of joy dreaming of the future of that child parents are filled with dread not daring to dream of a future for their child beyond a few precious weeks how can that be how can it be that two point six million babies die around the world before they and the shocking thing is why in too many cases we simply don 't know and the pie chart was labeled of death in children under five worldwide and there was a pretty big section of that pie chart about forty percent forty percent was labeled neonatal now neonatal is not a cause of death neonatal is simply an adjective an adjective that means that the but you can 't fix what you can 't define why are babies dying but is beginning to completely transform the whole field of global health it 's called precision public health for me precision medicine comes from a very special place but too often my treatments made them feel worse i still remember young women being driven to my clinic who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers we had few tools and the tools we did have couldn 't differentiate between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard and those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve having a suppressed immune system so infection was a constant threat were always surrounding us and i got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients that could do a better job and what herceptin allowed us to do is to precisely target and that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells while sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells it felt like a miracle we 're harnessing all those tools big data consumer gene sequencing and more to tackle a broad variety of diseases that 's allowing us to target individuals with the right remedies at the right time and i want everything to change again so i 've been asking myself why should we limit this smarter more precise better way to tackle diseases to the rich world now although i 'd actually kind of like that what i am talking about is moving from this precise targeting for individuals to tackle public health problems ok i know probably you 're thinking she 's crazy you can 't do that that 's too ambitious but here 's the thing we 're already doing this in a limited way and it 's already starting to make a big difference so here 's what 's happening now aids was a death sentence all my things are better but hiv aids remains a terrible global challenge worldwide about seventeen million women are living with hiv we know half those babies will not survive until the age of two so what do we do approach kind of like that blast of chemo would mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world that would do the job not practical we know in certain countries in sub saharan africa we can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest this precision approach to a public health problem has cut by nearly half hiv transmission from mothers to baby in the last five years screening pregnant women in certain areas in the developing world is a powerful example of how precision public health can change things on a big scale we know who to target where to target and how to target and that for me are the important elements of precision public health who what where and how but let 's go back to the two point six million babies who die before they 're one month old here 's the problem we just don 't know it may seem unbelievable but the way we figure out the causes of infant mortality in those countries with the highest infant mortality is a conversation with mom a health worker asks a mom who has just lost her child was the baby did they have a fever and that conversation may take place as long as three months now put yourself in the shoes of that mom excruciating conversation and even worse it 's not that helpful because we might know there was a fever or know why but what if we applied a precision public health approach let 's say for example we find out in certain areas of africa that babies are dying because of a bacterial infection transferred from the mother to the baby as group b streptococcus we can do that because then once we know we can bring the right interventions to the right population in the right places to save lives i have no doubt that a precision public health approach can help our world achieve our and that would translate into a million babies ' lives saved every single year and why would we stop there a much more powerful approach to public health imagine what might be possible why couldn 't we more effectively tackle malnutrition why wouldn 't we prevent cervical cancer in women and why not eradicate malaria yes clap for that so you know i live in two different worlds one world populated by scientists and another world populated by public health professionals we all live in two worlds the rich world and the poor world and what i 'm most excited about about precision public health is bridging these two worlds every day in the rich world we 're bringing incredible talent and tools everything at our disposal to precisely target diseases in ways we can tap into that kind of talent and tools then every parent would have the confidence to name their child the moment that child is born thank you"
