  "transcript": "and the catalyst for this change was the major earthquake that struck haiti on the 12th of january in two thousand and ten haiti was a game changer the earthquake destroyed the capital claiming the lives of some three hundred and twenty thousand people rendering homeless about one point two million people including the presidential palace i remember standing on the roof of the ministry of justice in downtown completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake it was clear for even the most but haiti provided because out of the urban devastation came a torrent of sms texts people crying for help offering support looking for their loved ones but eighty percent of the people outside haiti also converting tweets that had already been converted from texts and putting these into open source maps layering them with all sorts of important information people like crisis mappers and open street map and putting these on the web for everybody the media the aid organizations and the communities themselves to participate in back in haiti people were increasingly turning to the medium of sms people that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress were signaling their need for help on street sides all over port au prince entrepreneurs sprung up offering never having been confronted with this type of situation before we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and sms technology we started talking with a and we wanted it to be easy to use out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera tera the trilogy emergency response application which has been used to support the aid effort ever since it has been used to help communities prepare for disasters it has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather related disasters it 's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera but does it work some seventy four percent of people received the were intended to receive the data seventy four percent of them received it ninety six percent of them found it useful eighty three percent of them took action evidence that it is indeed empowering and seventy three percent of them shared it the tera system was developed from haiti with support of engineers in the region it is a technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect citizens and communities the old analog models of control and command one illustration of the transformational power of technology is in kibera kibera is one of africa 's largest slums it 's on the outskirts of nairobi the capital city of kenya it 's home to an unknown number of people some say between two hundred and fifty thousand and one point two million green national park devoid of human settlement gps handheld devices and mobile phones have literally put themselves on the map they have collated crowd sourced data and rendered the invisible visible people like josh and steve are continuing to layer information upon information real time information tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use you can find out about the latest security incident you can find out about places of worship you can find out about the health centers you can feel the dynamism of this living breathing community they also have their own news network on youtube with thousand viewers at the moment and we 're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories in mongolia for instance where thirty percent of the people are sms information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns sms is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation unfamiliar concrete environments they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on sms knowledge in nigeria my colleague jason peat who runs this program tells me it 's ten times faster and ten times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things and not only is it empowering to the communities but really importantly this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate we are on a planet of seven billion people five billion mobile subscriptions by two thousand and fifteen there will be three billion smartphones in the world the u n broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in fifty percent of the developing world we are hurtling towards a fast mobile devices people are understanding from cairo to oakland that there are new ways to come together there are new ways to there are new ways to influence a transformation is coming the knowledge that is there from market leaders who understand what it means to one idea that i 'd like you to consider for instance is to take a look at our it departments we need technology we need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question what would amazon or google do with all of this data and convert it to humanitarian good the possibilities that new digital technologies are bringing but i think in the future humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies in order to ensure that their voices are heard that they 're truly participating that they 're truly empowered in the humanitarian world it has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort we now have the tools we now have the possibilities there are no more reasons not to do it i believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital thank you very much"
