  "transcript": "i 'm an ocean chemist i look at the chemistry of the ocean today i look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past it was collected from close to antarctica thousands meters below the sea so very different than the kinds of corals you may have been lucky enough to see if you 've had a tropical holiday this was taken using satellite so it 's got tremendous spatial the overall features are extremely easy to understand the equatorial regions are warm because there 's more sunlight the polar regions are cold because there 's less sunlight and that allows big icecaps to build up on antarctica and up in the northern hemisphere and that 's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean come from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense the earth looked very much different and i 've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long and much much colder in the polar regions we know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn 't smooth as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation so we can measure co2 that 's why we know co2 was lower in the past and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature in the polar regions you see that temperature increased it didn and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls this is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount about a kilometer deep in international waters in the equatorial atlantic far from land you 're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals there are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain and the dark sort of stuff going to talk a little more about those as we travel back in time sometimes it looks a little more like this this is us trying to make sure that we don 't lose precious samples everyone 's scurrying around and i get terribly 's not always a lot of fun but overall it is so but we need we just saw a global map and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year but actually some of these mountains are as big as everest and if we do that we can get maps that resolution down thousands of meters here is a and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples we go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by and these are the kinds of things you see these are i 've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised this was after about fifteen hours of work and we were all a bit trigger happy and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past deep sea corals you 're going to see a picture of one in a moment it 's small about five centimeters high calcium carbonate so you can see its tentacles there moving in the ocean currents and the chemicals or the amount of chemicals depends on the temperature it depends on the nutrients and if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton we can then go back collect fossil specimens and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past we can do this very carefully i should add four thousand years is a long time if you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up this is about one hundred microns across which is pretty spectacular so what do we do we go in for these fossil specimens this is what makes but i make everyone go down to these bring them back we sort them out but each one of these is a different so on the left hand image here i 've taken a slice through a coral polished it very carefully and taken an optical image on the right hand side we 've taken that same piece of coral put you can see that marked out in the coral so we can see the uranium distribution why are we doing this uranium is a very poorly and that tells us exactly how old the fossils are this beautiful animation of the southern ocean i 'm just going to use illustrate how we 're using these corals you can see the density of the surface water in this animation by ryan abernathey it which is shown by the box is really one of the strongest currents in the world coming through here flowing from west to east and this allows co2 and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out and essentially the oceans are breathing through the southern ocean we 've collected corals from back and forth and we 've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating the corals migrated from south to north this transition from the glacial to the interglacial we don 't really know why but we think it 's something to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water so here we are i 'm going to illustrate what i think we 've found about climate from those corals in the southern ocean we this is my illustration of that we think back in the glacial from the analysis we 've made in the corals that the deep part of the southern and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition that allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure the chemistry of the corals we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out so this is the way we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment it 's thousands of meters deep there are new thank you"
