  "transcript": "hopefully for a good cause which is so first i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z or more precisely from a ak to zywiec and here 's a little image of that and this was an amazing year it was really a fascinating journey but after that i decided to work on the spirit as i mentioned last year i grew up with no religion at all i 'm jewish but i 'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian not really but i decided to learn about the bible and my heritage so i decided to follow all the rules of the bible and from the ten commandments to growing my beard because leviticus says you cannot shave so this is what i looked like by the end thank you for that reaction so there was the the topiary there and there 's the sheep now and i just finished a couple and i have to say thank god because living so healthily was killing me it was so overwhelming because the amount of things you have to do it 's just mind boggling i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers and they were telling me i had to eat right i had to put on sunscreen this and you have to reapply it every two to four hours so i think half of my i was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year and my immunologist told me that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and because that 's a part of health i was inspired by the danish safety council they started a public campaign that says and you can see there they 're shopping with their helmets laughter i tried that now it 's a little extreme i admit but if you think about this this is actually the freakonomics authors wrote about this that more so and i was so focused on doing all these things that i was neglecting my friends and family and as dan buettner can tell you and i i kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over i went to the dark side and i just indulged myself it was like something out of caligula without the sex part because i have three young kids so that wasn 't happening and i finally have stabilized so now i 'm back to adopting many not all i don 't wear a helmet anymore but dozens of healthy behaviors that i adopted during of course don 't have time to go into all of them let me just tell you two really quickly the first is and this was surprising to me i didn 't expect this to come out but i live a much quieter life now because we live in such a noisy world there 's trains and planes and cars and bill o which it obviously does but it actually initiates the fight or flight response a loud noise will get your over the years can cause real damage it was done in europe and they estimated that one point six million years of healthy living are lost every year in europe so they think it 's actually very deadly when they wrote the constitution they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate so without noise reduction technology our country would not exist so as a patriot i felt it was important to i wear all the earplugs and the earphones and it 's really improved my life in in a surprising and unexpected way and the second point i want to make the final point is that and it 's actually been a theme of tedmed that that joy is so important to your health that and just to give you one instance of this food the junk food industry is really great at at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what 's the most pleasurable but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food to give just one example we so and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you 're eating doritos and so that is it the book about it comes out in april it 's called drop dead healthy and i hope that i don 't get sick during the book tour that 's my greatest hope so thank you very much"
