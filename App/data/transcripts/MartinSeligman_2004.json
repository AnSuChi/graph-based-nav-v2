  "transcript": "an encounter i had with cnn summarizes what i 'm going to be talking about today which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic the editor of discover told us so they came to me cnn and they said professor seligman would you tell us about the the state of psychology today we 'd like to interview you about that really better give you a longer sound bite how many words do i get this time professor seligman what is the state of psychology today not good enough that 's what i 'm going to be talking about i want to say why psychology was good why it was not good and how it and by parallel about entertainment and design because i think the issues are very similar so why was psychology good well for more than sixty years psychology worked within the disease model ten years ago when i was on an airplane and i introduced myself to my seatmate and told them what i did they 'd move away from me and now when i tell people what i do what was good about psychology about the $ thirty billion investment nimh made about working in the disease model about what you mean and now fourteen of the disorders are treatable two of them actually curable and the other thing that happened is that a science developed a science of mental illness we found out we could take fuzzy concepts like that we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses we could look across time at the same people people for example who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia and ask what the contribution of mothering of genetics are and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the and best of all we were able in the last fifty years to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments and then we were able to test them rigorously in keep the things that actively the conclusion of that is psychology and psychiatry of the last sixty years can actually claim that we can make i 'm proud of it that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists pathologizers bricks fell on you and we forgot that people made choices and decisions we forgot responsibility that was the first cost the second cost was that we forgot about you people we forgot about improving became a dirty word no one works on that and the third problem about the disease model in our rush to do something about repairing never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier and so that 's what led dan gilbert mike the first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness it should be and it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling and with genius with nurturing high talent it turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness and any of you for free can go to that website [ www authentichappiness org ] and take how do you stack against literally tens of thousands of other people we created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio how they 're defined how to diagnose them what builds them and what gets in their way between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness and i 've asked the question how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you and starting about six years ago we asked about extremely happy people how do they differ from the rest of us it turns out there 's one way very surprising they 're not more religious they 're not in better shape they don 't have more money they 're not better looking they they don 't sit in seminars on saturday they don 't spend time alone each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends and it 's about happiness in the first hollywood sense i 'm going to talk about happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer and i 'm going to suggest to you that 's not nearly enough in just a moment and we find that we 've been able to manualize many of them and we actually carry out which ones actually make people lastingly happier in a couple of minutes i 'll tell you about some of those results but the upshot of this is that the mission i want psychology to have in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill can psychology actually make people happier and to ask that question is not a word i use very much we 've had to break it down into what i think is askable about happy and i believe there are three different it 's possible to have one rather than the other three different happy lives the first happy life this is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can your love your leisure time stops for you and it 's simply best we we can find it it 's having as many of the pleasures as you can as much positive emotion as you can and learning the skills savoring mindfulness and it 's why positive psychology is not and why it doesn 't end is about fifty percent heritable and in fact not very modifiable so the different tricks that matthieu and i and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are fifteen to twenty percent tricks getting more of it second is that positive emotion habituates it habituates the first taste is one hundred percent by the time you 're down to the sixth taste it 's gone and as i said it 's not particularly malleable and this leads to the second life i have to tell you about my friend len to talk about by the time len was thirty len was enormously successful the first arena was work by the time he was twenty he was an options trader by the he was twenty five he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company and the reason he was was that len is get lost and len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a park avenue psychoanalyst who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of but it turned out there wasn 't any sexual trauma it turned out that len grew up in long island and he played football and watched football and len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities the question is is and i want to say not contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom fifty percent of the human race in positive affectivity when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at thirty in the morning time stops for him and it stops till the closing bell when the first card is played and this is indeed what mike csikszentmihalyi has been talking about about flow and it 's distinct from pleasure in a very important way it 's thought and feeling but what mike told you yesterday during flow you can 't feel anything and this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life and we think there 's a recipe for it and it 's knowing what your highest strengths there 's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are and then re crafting your life your friendship your parenting just one example one person i worked with was a bagger at genuardi 's hated the job she 's working her way through college her highest strength was social intelligence she re crafted bagging but what she did was to take her highest strengths and re craft work to use them as much as possible what you get out of that is not smiley ness you don 't look like debbie reynolds you don 't giggle a lot what you get is more absorption the second path is traditionally and meaning in this view consists of very parallel to it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are i mentioned that for all three kinds of lives the good life the meaningful life people are now hard at work on the question are there things that lastingly change those lives and answer seems to be yes and i 'll just give you some samples of it it so we do studies of different interventions just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect when we teach people next saturday and we can show in that way that close your eyes i 'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction you never properly thanked the person has to be alive now ok you can open your eyes i hope all of you have such a person your assignment when you 're learning the gratitude visit is to write a 300 word testimonial to that person call them on the phone in phoenix you read the testimonial and what happens is when we test people they 're both happier and less depressed another example is a strengths date in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths we find this is a strengthener of and fun versus philanthropy it 's so heartening to be in a group like this in which well my undergraduates and the people i work with haven 't so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun it has a square wave walk set when you do something philanthropic to help another person it lasts and it lasts so those are examples of positive so the next to last thing i want to say interested in how much life satisfaction people have this is really what you 're about so we ask and we 've done this in fifteen replications involving thousands of people to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure the pursuit of positive emotion the pleasant life the pursuit of engagement time stopping for you and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction it turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution the pursuit of engagement is also very strong where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning then pleasure 's the whipped cream and the cherry which is to say the full life the sum is greater than if you 've got all three conversely if you have none of the three the empty life the sum is less than the parts and what we 're asking now is does the very same relationship physical health morbidity how long you live and productivity follow the same relationship that is is in a corporation is engagement and meaning is health a function of positive engagement of pleasure and of meaning in life and there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard and so this was amazing for me i 've never been i 've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much which was one of the remarkable things entertainment and design entertainment and design have been and can be used for we also know that technology entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery and by the way the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important that if i and it turns out the skills of happiness the skills of the pleasant life the skills of engagement the skills of meaning are different from the skills of relieving misery and so the parallel thing it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase and that 's typically how they 've been used but once you fractionate happiness the way i do not just positive emotion that 's not nearly enough entertainment and so in conclusion the eleventh reason for optimism in addition to to the space elevator is that i think with technology entertainment and design we can actually increase and if meaning and if design can increase positive emotion thank you"
