  "transcript": "and so here 's the challenge i want you to help me create a fully 3d dynamic parameterized contact model and it is a true challenge and i do want you to help me of course in the challenge there is a prize it so please send me your ideas what do we have to do we have to first know what a foot is if we go to the dictionary it says so you go to the literature laughter maybe you 're familiar with this literature the problem there are many many feet how do you do this you need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work and i want you to help me do that in this next clip as you see this clip look for principles and also think about experiments that you might design in order to understand how a foot works all but it 's a synthesis of the secrets of many many feet now it the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present or simulate that but it didn 't even slow down the animal it 's still running at the human equivalent of three hundred miles per hour now how could it do that well look more carefully when we slow it down fifty times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris the leg is acting the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot the foot is distributed you can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach without a foot here 's what it does it doesn 't even slow can run the same speed without even that segment no problem for the cockroach they can grow them back if you care how do they do it look carefully this is slowed down one hundred times and watch what it 's doing with the rest of its leg it 's acting again as a distributed foot very effective now the question we had is how general is a distributed foot and the take a look at what that is that 's a bipedal octopus that 's disguised as a rolling coconut it was discovered by christina huffard and filmed by sea studios right here from monterey we 've also described another species it walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can 't be seen and look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain it uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there truly extraordinary in one three million years ago evolved the next animal it actually rolls and it can even roll uphill it 's the ultimate distributed foot its whole body in this case is acting so if we want to then to but also the leg and even of the body we biologically inspired this robot named rhex built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years rhex 's foot started off to be quite simple then it got tuned over time and ultimately resulted in this half circle why is that the video will show you watch it go over this you can see it here well on this debris extraordinary no sensing the control is built right into the tuned legs and my assistant 's going to help me here when you touched the cockroach leg can you get the microphone for him when you touched the cockroach leg what did it feel like did you notice something boy spiny robert full it 's spiny right it 's sort of hurts maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he 'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach chris anderson did you touch it rf so if you look carefully at this what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago no one knew what they did they assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures we found that they 're for something else but they 're stiff in the other direction so they capture but of course we can deal with that because we can produce artificial spines we can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out we did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs as you see here this is slowed down 20 fold and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris so why not add a spine my colleagues did this at u penn dan koditschek put some steel nails very simple and you 'll see it grab on right there it couldn 't do that before it would just slip and get stuck and tip over and watch again right there now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn 't mean you can climb vertical this is really really difficult but look at this animal do it one of the ones i 'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that 's a smooth metal plate it the animal effectively climbs by slipping and look and doing actually terribly with respect to grabbing on the surface it looks in fact like it 's swimming up the surface we can actually model that behavior actually is working more like a paddle the same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand it 's actually functioning as a paddle even though it 's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid this is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself martin buehler did who 's now at boston dynamics now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot for rough surfaces though animals add claws and you probably feel them if you grabbed it did you touch it ca i did rf mark cutkosky at stanford university one of my collaborators is an extraordinary engineer and here 's the simple version of a foot for a new robot now if we look at animals though to be really maneuverable in all surfaces the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws and spines and hairs and pads and glue and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other things these are all from different insects there 's an ant crawling up a vertical surface let 's look at that ant this is when its foot 's in the air watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich and that 's where the glue is and when the claws don 't dig in that pad automatically comes comes out without the ant doing anything it just extrudes and this was a hard shot to get i think this is this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings so it 's pretty pretty tough to to do this is what it looks like close up here 's the ant foot and there 's the glue and we discovered this glue may be an interesting two phase mixture it certainly helps it to hold on so now we have something better the gecko 's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature which they stick on with involves their hairy toes they can run up a surface at a meter per second take thirty steps in that one second you can hardly see them if we slow it and when you watch how they detach it it is bizarre they peel away from the surface like you 'd peel away a piece of tape very strange how do they stick if you look at their feet they have leaf like structures called linalae with millions of hairs and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible it has a hundred to a thousand split because it allows intimate contact the gecko has a billion of these this has inspired the design of the first self cleaning dry adhesive the patent issued we 're happy to say and here 's the and here 's the first attempt to have it work on some load there 's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields you could think of a thousand possible uses lots of people have and we 're excited about realizing this as a product we have imagined products for example this one we imagined a and then made this band aid this is an undergraduate volunteer we have thirty thousand undergraduates so we can choose among them that 's actually just a red red pen mark but it makes an incredible it 's aerated it can be peeled off easily it doesn 't cause any irritation it works underwater curiosity based research we just wondered how they climbed up something can lead to things that you could never imagine it 's just an example of why we need to support now what a foot is here 's the new project we i call the new robot rise for robot in scansorial environment that 's a climbing environment and here is rise and here are rise 's first steps on so this is very new but we think we got the dynamics right he 's the one able to build this shape deposition manufactured so the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right attempt to make that climb and ultimately put on the robot and that 's exactly what he 's done he 's built in fact a climbing foot bot and here 's cutkosky 's and his amazing students ' design so these are tuned toes there are six of them and they use the principles that i just talked about collectively for the blueprint so this is not using any suction any glue and it will ultimately when it 's attached to the robot it 's as biologically inspired as the as the animal hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface here you see it next going up the side of a building at stanford it 's a foot climbing it 's not the whole robot yet we 're working on it now you can see how it 's attaching these tuned structures allow the spines friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging difficult and so they were able to get this thing this is now sped up twenty times can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor ok you can visualize this now it 's not impossible it 's a very legs and even body that nature uses hybrid solutions not a single solution to these problems and they 're integrated and beautifully robust we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make potentially something better than nature"
