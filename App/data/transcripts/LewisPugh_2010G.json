  "transcript": "last year when i was here i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole and while that swim took place three years ago i can remember it as if it was yesterday i remember standing on the edge of the ice about to dive into the water and thinking to myself i have never the water is minus one point seven degrees centigrade or twenty nine degrees fahrenheit it 's flipping freezing in that water and then a thought came across my mind if things on this swim how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers and then i said to myself i 've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible and the only way i can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer and then committing myself a hundred percent there is nothing more powerful than the made up mind and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water and i remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because partially of water when water freezes it expands and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst i 'm never ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again i heard about the himalayas and the melting of the and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change i heard about this lake lake imja this lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier the glacier 's gone all the way up the mountain and i firmly believe that what we 're seeing in the himalayas is the next great big battleground on this nearly two billion people so one in three people on this earth rely on the water from the himalayas and with a population increasing as quickly as it is i think we have a real risk of instability north the highest mountain on this earth and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit now i don 't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to mt everest but it 's quite an ordeal getting up there twenty eight great big powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain i don 't just have my speedo but there 's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world i wanted to do the swim at five thousand three hundred meters above sea level so it 's right up in the heavens it 's very very difficult to breath you get altitude sickness i feels like you 've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time that 's not the worst part of it the worst part was this year many many people have died on mt everest and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain and when you 're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done in fact no fish there are no fish up there swimming at five thousand three hundred meters when you 're trying to do that and then the bodies are coming past you it humbles you and you also realize very very clearly that nature and we walked up this pathway all the way up and to the right hand side of us was this great khumbu glacier and all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice then we got up to this and i prepared myself the same way as i 've always prepared myself for this swim which was going to be so very difficult i put on my ipod i listened to some music i got myself as aggressive as possible but controlled aggression and then i hurled myself and i was able to and i don 't where i got it from but i was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have i have never ever heard such utter bollocks it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have and then we walked as quickly as we could down over the rubble down to our and there we sat down and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt everest they said lewis you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim every single thing which you have learned every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the british army about speed and aggression you put that to one side and instead of swimming fast swim as slowly as instead of swimming crawl and so we walked back up and i stood there on the edge and i looked up at mt everest and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth and i said to and i can 't begin to tell you how good i felt when i came to the other side but i learned two very very important lessons there on mt everest and i thank my team of sherpas who taught me this the first one is before i do anything i ask myself what type of mindset do i require to successfully complete a task everest of all problems just because we 've lived the way we have lived for so long just because we have consumed the way we have for so long doesn 't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on the warning signs are all there when i was born the world 's population was three point five billion people and i 've come here to ask you today what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world and most importantly in a sustainable world and i ask you please to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make which will make that big difference and then blog about it tweet about it talk about it and commit a hundred percent because very very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it so thank you very very much"
