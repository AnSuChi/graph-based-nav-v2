  "transcript": "my life i felt i knew them for as long as i could remember and i want to share with you how i came to that place and what i 've learned since i left this is a police photo that 's actually my car we 're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in los angeles called and the situation is that a car full of paramedics on their way home from the hospital after work and when they do they find that behind the glass but there is still a pulse and they get me to that nearby hospital cedars sinai where that night i receive because of my internal bleeding forty five units of blood which means full full replacements of all the blood in me before they 're able to staunch the flow i 'm put on full life support now comas are measured on a scale from fifteen down to three fifteen is a mild coma three is the deepest and if you look you 'll see that there 's only one way you can score three it 's essentially there 's no sign of life from outside at all i spent more than a month in a glasgow coma scale three and it is inside that deepest level of coma on the rim between my life and my death that i 'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness from my family looking in from outside what they 're trying to figure out is which is how far is it going to be possible to bridge from the comatose potential mind that they 're looking at to an actual mind which i define simply as the functioning of the brain that is remaining inside my head and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television is the earth channel and your favorite show is the human show and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting it 's so unpredictable the show began with tremendous special effects because there were catastrophic climate shifts which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today because of the earth tilting on its axis and those catastrophic climate shifts we had to figure out how to find better food and we had to learn there 's lucy that 's how we all began we had to learn how to crack open animal bones use tools to do that to feed on the marrow to grow our brains more so we actually grew our consciousness in response to this global threat now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in india in madhya pradesh there 's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found it 's a cupule that took forty to fifty thousand blows with the very first shape we draw as a child is a circle and then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle we create an eye and the eye that evolves through all of our history there 's the egyptian god horus which symbolizes prosperity wisdom and health so watching all of this show from outer space you think we get it we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness because it 's the first thing we draw we surround ourselves until it was stripped from me i never thought about it and what i 've learned since that event and during my recovery is that consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it 's never been under threat before these are just some examples and the reason i 'm so honored to be here to talk today in india is because india has the sad distinction of being the head injury capital which means that india unless something changes is accumulating a need for millennia of rehabilitation what you find in the united states is an injury every twenty that 's one and a half million every year stroke every forty seconds alzheimer 's disease every seventy seconds somebody succumbs to that all of these represent gaps between potential mind and actual mind and here are some of the other categories if you look at the whole planet the world health organization tells us that depression is the number one disease on earth in terms of years lived with disability we find that the number two source of disability is depression in the age group of fifteen to forty four our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate if you look at some of these other items concussions half of e r admissions from adolescents are fifteen percent suffer migraines that wipe them out for days on end all of this is leading computer addiction just to cover that the most frequent thing we do is use digital devices the average teenager sends three thousand three hundred texts every [ month ] we 're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift and that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of cedars sinai medical center this is a dense array eeg mri this is how i was when i returned from the hospital nearly four months the horseshoe shape you can see on my skull is where they operated and went inside my brain to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life but if you look into the eye of consciousness that single eye you can see i 'm looking down but let me tell you how i felt at that point euphoric and depressed because the brain is the world 's first fully functional quantum computer it can occupy multiple this is now flash forward to the point in time where i 've been discharged by the health system look into those eyes i 'm not able to focus those eyes i 'm not able to follow a line of text in a book it requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension but in two dimensions i think you can see the beautiful symmetry and illumination of normal mind at work here 's my brain so my family as we moved forward and discovered that the health care system had moved us by had to try to find solutions and answers and during that process it took many years one of the doctors said that my recovery and that was when i started to write a book because i didn 't think it was miraculous i thought there were miraculous elements i want to share four particular aspects i call them the plasticity means that there was always hope for our reason hope for our ability to rebuild that function can redefine itself and this is demonstrated by two specialists called hagen and silva back in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy 's the global perspective is that up to thirty percent of children in school have learning weaknesses that are not but with appropriate treatment they can be screened for and detected and corrected and avoid their academic but what i discovered is it 's almost impossible to find anyone who provides that treatment or care here 's what my neuropsychologist provided for me when i actually found somebody who could apply it i 'm not a doctor so i 'm not going to talk about the various subtests let 's just talk about is the mental processing how fast you can acquire information retain it and retrieve it that is essential for success in life today untestable that and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of seventy nine which is just below average that 's when i was discharged from the system it meant that when i was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in fifty this is a very very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system then i underwent cognitive training and let me show you what happened to the right hand column when i did my cognitive training this is not supposed to occur i q is supposed to stabilize and solidify at the age of eight now the journal of the national medical association and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it but they asked one question they said is this repeatable that was a fair question because my memoir was simply how i found solutions that worked for me the answer is yes and for the first time it 's to share two examples here 's somebody what they did as they went through cognitive training at ages seven and eleven and here 's another person in call it high school and college and with accommodation they went on to college and had a full life in terms of their opportunities i still had crushing migraine headaches two elements that worked for me here the craniomandibular system is critical to that and this is the interrelationship between the tmj and the teeth up to thirty percent of the population have a disorder disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body i was fortunate to find so my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position if that sounds like a very very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement how can the jaw affect the entire body let me simply point out to you if i ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk that tiny misalignment bear in mind there are no nerves in the teeth that 's why the same between the before and after that this shows it 's hard to see the difference now just trying putting the next issue that resolved was that if ninety percent of the other ten percent largely if you set aside brain cancer and hormonal issues is the circulation imagine the blood flowing through your body i was told at ucla medical center as one sealed system if that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body your brain this is a level of pain that 's only known to other people who suffer vascular migraines and in the following months and i felt the neurological flow of life itself returning communication the next c whether to restore and i 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed the fm device this is it being held in the hand five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin corrosion free for over eighty years so it goes in and it stays there here are the implantation sites the concept that they 're working towards and they have working prototypes is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they 're needed the main unit will then go inside the brain an fm device in the cortex of the brain the motor cortex will send signals in real time to the motor points in the relevant muscles so that the person will be able to move their arm let 's say in real time if they 've lost control of their arm and other fm devices implanted in fingertips on contacting a surface will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain so that the person feels a sense of touch is this science fiction no because i 'm wearing the first application of this technology i don 't have the ability to control my left foot a radio device is controlling every step i take and a sensor picks up my foot for me every time i walk and in closing want to share the personal reason why this meant so much to me and changed the direction of my life i recognized my family but i didn 't remember my own past and the following morning that i 'd been working in film and television and that i had been in a crash now in the dark years work out what remained for me if everything that made today special was gone i discovered what truly remained i believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness that the human show can stay on the air for millennia to come want to talk to him for a second i went to la to meet him and so i was sitting in this waiting for a man to come by who and then we met and we talked and i 'm like he doesn 't look like somebody and then i was amazed at what role technology played in your recovery and we have his book outside in the bookshop the thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to every treatment he got every near miss he and this records every single step i 've taken and if i do this probably the mic won 't hear it and that 'll mean that it 's armed and ready to go and it works it works and what i would love to add because i didn 't have time that underneath my heel there is a sensor this thing blinks all the time i 'll leave it out so you might be able to see it but this is blinking all the time it 's sending signals in real time and it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation the other things they 've worked on i didn 't have time to say this in my talk is they 've restored functional hearing to thousands of deaf people this was going to be an abandoned technology but alfred mann met the doctor who was going to retire [ dr schindler ] and he was going to retire all the technology was going to be lost because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on because it was a small issue but of deaf people in the world and the cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now and the other thing is they 're working on artificial retinas for the blind i should clarify that because the first i must tell you they 're an amazing there 's a hundred people who work in that building engineers scientists and other team members alfred mann has set up this foundation to advance this research because he saw there 's no way venture capital would come in for something like this the audience is too small you 'd but the audience is too small and the amount of research the time it takes the fda clearances the payback time is too long for v c to be interested so he saw a need and he stepped in he 's a very very remarkable man he 's done a lot of"
