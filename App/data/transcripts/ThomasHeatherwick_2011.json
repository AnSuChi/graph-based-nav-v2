  "transcript": "i have a studio in london that has a particular approach to designing buildings i was exposed to making and crafts and materials and i was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications i was seeing and this influenced i spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that 'm just going to show for people who don 't know my studio 's work a few projects that we 've worked on this is a hospital building this is studios for artists this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and one hundred and fifty thousand and this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to st paul 's cathedral in london and this is a cafe by the sea in britain and just very quickly something we 've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of london to design a new bus that gave the passenger because the original routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with which had this open platform at the back in fact i think all our routemasters are here in california now actually but they aren 't in london and so you 're you 're stuck on a bus and if the bus is going to so we 've been working with transport for london and we 've been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and and and this is and openings seemed everyone loves opening bridges but it 's quite a basic thing i think we all kind of stand and watch but the the bridges that we saw that opened and closed and it had broken like this and and it 's a very boring bridge as you can see it 's just steel and timber but instead of what it is our focus was on the way the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other we actually had to halve its speed because everyone was too scared when we first did it so that 's it speeded up the subject of where our future water is 't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that and so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station our condition was that we would work with them and so we so we looked at how we could compose all those elements instead of just and there are two thousand new homes being built next to this power station so it felt this has a rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of could be a place that pulls you in and it has to be i 'm trying to get my two hundred and fifty feet high so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that 's there on the site and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and way of making a structure to do this the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top it 's a power park so people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in shanghai we were invited to build well we weren 't invited what am i talking about we won the competition and it was painful to get there so we won the competition to build the 's two hundred and fifty pavilions it 's the world 's biggest ever expo and the british government saying you need to be in the top five and so that that became instead of trying to have everything and so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn 't do a cheesy advert for britain and particularly the victorians pioneered and i 've never met anyone who says and the same with flowers i 've never met anyone who says i don 't like flowers but we realized that seeds there 's been this very serious project happening but that seeds at these major botanical gardens but this this phenomenal project 's been happening so we realized we had to make a project that would be because the the dna of the dinosaur rather than looking like nuts challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things we didn 't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we were trying to think how could we make a whole whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other western nations so that was also in the mix with you get the idea so the idea was to take thousand seeds that they agreed to give us and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and and grow that through through this and make it a building and inside the daylight each one is an optic and it brings light into the center and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a building as big as the football pitch we and the government agreed to do that and and not do anything else and focus our energy on that and so the rest of the site and with a million people there a day it just felt like offering some public space we worked with an astroturf manufacturer to develop a and then you know there 's nothing there 's no famous actor 's voice there 's no projections there 's no televisions there 's no color changing there 's just silence and a cool temperature and if a if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips where it 's letting the light through this is the only project that we 've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings a key thing was how people would interact i mean in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo you the british government any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have and there was a lot of terror i 'm sorry about my stupid voice there texture is something in the projects we 've been working on these but the materiality feels the same is something that we 've been trying to and it 's in a and the mayor of kuala lumpur said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be and you is actually the bottom part of a tower like this so if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom and by linking these together we could have ninety percent of the site as a rainforest instead of only ten percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings so we 're building these buildings rather than engulf it thank you thomas you 're a delight since we have an extra minute here i thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building th these are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure so there thousand of these this optic was and so the daylight was just coming it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate but if you say you 're going to drill sixty six thousand holes in it there was one person in the contractors who was the right size and it wasn 't a child who could fit between them for the final waterproofing of the building"
