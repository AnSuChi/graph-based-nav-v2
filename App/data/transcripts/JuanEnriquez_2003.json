  "transcript": "i 'm supposed to scare you because it 's but not for the reasons why you think you should be you should be really afraid that if we stick up the first slide on this thing there we go that you 're missing out because if you spend this week thinking about iraq and thinking about bush and thinking about the stock market you 're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we 've ever been on and this is what this adventure 's really about every life form on this planet every insect every bacteria every plant every animal it looks like that and and this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on it 's the single greatest mapping project we 've ever been on if you think that the mapping of america 's made a difference or landing on the moon or this other it 's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacteria and it 's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution laughter it turns out that what this stuff is and richard dawkins has written about this is this is really a river out of eden so the three point two billion base pairs inside each of your cells and we could start dating things and when they were subject to the plague most people didn 't survive but those who survived you didn 't have that ccr5 population pressure mutation we can date it to seven hundred years ago and we 're beginning to find these little things for malaria for sickle cell for and i want you to toast these two people and that is almost as important a date as the so all you guys have heard about dna all the stuff that dna does but some of the stuff we 're discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet and we 're finding amoebas like this this is the amoeba dubia and except that each of you has about three point two billion letters which is what makes you you as far as gene code inside your cells and this little amoeba which you know sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions turns out to have six hundred and twenty billion base pairs of gene code inside it may not turn out to be chips it may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba and again we 're learning from life and how life works this funky little thing people didn 't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and then finally somebody picked up a microscope and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores living in about two hundred times the radiation that would kill you and by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is because if you can live in radiation that looks like this that brings up a whole series of interesting questions this little thingamajig we didn 't know this thingamajig existed we should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye and what you 're looking at with this namibiensis is the biggest bacteria we 've ever seen so it 's about the size of a little we didn 't know this thing was there this is a really odd one this is ferroplasma the reason why ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron lives inside the equivalent of battery acid it turns out this is a very efficient life form and they call it an archaea archaea means the ancient ones and the reason why they 're ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core so it 's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins that you should be aware of george bush he 's going to be gone alright life isn 't whether the humans survive or don 't survive these things are going to be living on this and it 's just beginning to understand this code of dna that 's really the most exciting intellectual tries to figure out how to breed an animal that 's almost extinct they can 't do it naturally so what they do with this thing is they take reprogram when you do that the cow gives birth to a gaur sumatran tigers and the australians bless their hearts are playing with these things now the last of these things died in september one thousand nine hundred and thirty six these are tasmanian tigers we may be able to close the gene gaps and when we learn how to we may give birth to an animal that hasn 't walked the earth since one thousand nine hundred and thirty six and you can think about other they 're trying to figure out what the primordial ancestor is you can take that tree of life and collapse it back and in the measure that you learn to reprogram maybe we 'll give birth and it 's all coming out of things that look like this huge gene sequencing facilities the that means each of you will contain and it will be really boring it will read the really neat thing about this stuff is that 's life and laurie 's going to talk about this one a little bit because if you happen to find this one inside your body you 're in big trouble because that 's the source code for ebola that 's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans but plants work the same way and insects work the same way and this apple works the same way this apple is the same thing as this floppy disk and this thing codes a execute and it goes [ thump ] right pushes a exe what it does is it executes the first line of code which reads just like that tacgggg make a flower that 's white that blooms in the spring that smells like this in the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it and by the way the first plant was read two years ago the first human was read two years ago the first insect was read two years ago the and can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials which is why dupont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn but we 're reprogramming it this is what you look like and what you can do now is you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here and in the measure that you can do that you can go home today and get on the internet and access the world 's biggest public library which is a library of life he 's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings why would cliff be doing that he doesn 't have a restaurant the and you picked up the lizard sometimes the tail fell off but it regrew each cell can be reprogrammed if we don 't stop stem cell research and in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings and what the program is for those cells to and you are likely to be wandering around and your children on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of in some places in the world where they don 't stop the research if each of you differs from the person next to you by one in a thousand but only three percent codes which means it 's only one in a thousand times three percent very small differences in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference take a simple declarative sentence men read that sentence and they look at that sentence and they read this okay this is the way it should be seen that 's what your genes are doing that 's why you differ from this person over here but you know he 's reasonably good looking but i won 't go there you can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation you can look at and they look at the world a little differently they look at the same world and they say mice have thirty thousand genes husbands have thirty thousand genes you can make very small changes in gene code and get really they will test any one of you for sixty thousand that brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff but it also allows us to start going after diseases because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes and in if it is not expressing in your body if you don 't have one of those types a particular one of those types don 't take gleevec it won 't do anything for you same thing with receptin if you 've got breast cancer changes the predictions of medicine changes the way medicine works in terms of its printed volume of data contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company every month than is in the printed so all of you know that the price of computers except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data 's being deposited in genbank moore 's law it 's the blue line this is going to push computers to have to grow faster than they 've been growing because so far there haven 't been applications that have been required that need to go faster than moore 's law this stuff does and here 's an interesting map this is a map which was finished at the harvard business school one of the really interesting questions is if all this data 's free who 's using it this is the greatest public library in the world well it turns out that there 's about twenty seven trillion bits moving inside from the united states to the united states about four point six no one 's reading so this is what a new map of the world looks like that is the genomically literate world and you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life and you can watch new york fall off a cliff and you can watch new jersey fall off a cliff and you can watch the rise because it 's specific counties and if you want to get more specific it 's actually specific zip codes well in southern california it 's happening in ninety two thousand one hundred and that 's it and that 's the triangle between salk scripps ucsd and it 's called torrey pines road and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country in about three or four carefully picked 747s same thing in massachusetts looks more spread out but oh by the way the ones that are the same color are contiguous what 's the net effect of this in an agricultural society the difference between the richest and the poorest the most productive and the least productive was five to one why because in agriculture if you had ten kids and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder you could produce about five times more wealth on average than your neighbor in a knowledge that number is now four hundred and twenty seven to one but in microsoft and linux and apple and very soon it 's going to matter if you 're literate in life code so if there is something you should fear it 's that you 're not keeping your eye on the ball because it really matters who speaks life and it turns out that if you went back to the and then the u s came in about one thousand nine hundred and fifty and then switzerland about one thousand nine hundred and seventy three and then the u s got back on top beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks and today of course you all know that the most productive nation on earth is luxembourg producing about one third more wealth per person per year than america tiny landlocked state no natural resources just smart people moving bits here 's differential productivity rates here 's how many people it takes to produce a single u s patent it 's got nothing to do with inflation nothing to do with privatization you can take he still crashes the country because he doesn 't understand how the rules have changed oh yeah and it takes about five point six million indians well watch what happens to india india and china used to be forty percent of the global economy just at the industrial revolution and they are now about four point eight percent two billion people one third of the global population producing five percent of the wealth because they didn 't get this change because they kept treating their people like serfs instead of like shareholders of a common project and that 's why they say that silicon valley has been powered by not integrated circuits indians and chinese"
