  "transcript": "no one not jacques perrin not jacques cousteau or rachel carson imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it it seemed at that time to be i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us and to consider why it matters that in fifty years we 've lost why you should care that nearly i 'm haunted by the thought of what ray anderson calls tomorrow we didn 't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time well now is that time i hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and in so doing secure hope for humankind health to the ocean means health for us and i hope jill tarter 's wish to engage earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe and i hope jill that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet i guess i did for me as a scientist it all began in i actually love diving at night you see a lot of fish then that you don 't see in the daytime diving day and night was really easy for me in one thousand nine hundred and seventy when i led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine i had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called jim six miles offshore and one thousand two hundred and fifty feet down it 's one of my favorite bathing suits since then i 've used about thirty kinds of submarines and i 've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search i led a five year national geographic expedition the sustainable seas expeditions food water temperature all the things you need to stay alive in space i heard astronaut joe allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system and then he pointed to this and he said the poet auden said thousands imagine earth without it i gave a talk not so long ago at the world bank and i showed this amazing image of earth and i said there it is the world bank that 's where all the assets are and tim worth says the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment with every drop of water you drink every breath you take no matter where on earth you over time most of the planet 's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there mostly by microbes the ocean drives climate and weather stabilizes temperature shapes earth 's chemistry and provides home for yet we have this idea we humans that the earth all of it the oceans the skies are so vast and so resilient it doesn 't matter what we do to it that may have been true ten thousand years ago and maybe even one thousand years ago the wildlife that make our lives possible new technologies are helping us to understand the nature i mean first you have to know that you 've got a but first we have to know who 's the head of google earth and i told him how much i loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously but i asked him when are you going to finish it you did a great job with the land the dirt what about the water i 've had the great pleasure of working with the googlers with doer marine with national geographic with dozens of the best institutions ones that we could enlist to put the ocean in google earth and as of just this week last monday google earth is now whole we can look at where we 're sitting and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium the ocean and california 's four national marine sanctuaries and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets but also what 's below to see wait a minute we can go kshhplash right there ha under the what the whales see we can go explore we can go actually and swim around on google earth and visit with humpback whales these are the gentle giants that i 've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater there we can pick up and fly to the deepest place seven miles down the mariana trench where only two people have ever been imagine that it 's only seven miles but only two people have been there forty nine years ago we need new deep diving submarines how about some x prizes for ocean exploration and understand life in the deep sea we can now go to the arctic just ten years ago i stood on the ice at the north pole an ice free arctic ocean excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global it 's also changing ocean chemistry making the sea more acidic that 's bad news for coral reefs and plankton also it 's bad news for us we we 're clogging the ocean poisoning the planet 's circulatory system and we 're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife all undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle the water cycle our life support system we 're still killing bluefin tuna truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead we kill using long lines with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for fifty miles or more using google earth you can witness trawlers in china the north sea the gulf of mexico the next time you dine on sushi or sashimi or swordfish steak or shrimp cocktail whatever wildlife you to enjoy from the ocean think even one hundred pounds may be thrown away as bycatch this is the consequence of not knowing this chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from hundred to two thousand the highest concentrations are in red most of the turtles sharks tunas and whales are way down in numbers but there is good news ten percent of the big fish still remain there are still some blue whales there are still some krill in half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet but not a lot to turn things around but business as usual means that in fifty years there may be no coral reefs and no commercial fishing because the fish will simply be gone imagine the ocean and some actions are being taken to protect trees watersheds and wildlife with yellowstone national the united states began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea america ever had providing a carbon sink generating oxygen protecting watersheds national marine the good news is the bad news is that you have to look hard to find them in the last three years for example the u s protected three hundred and forty thousand square miles of ocean but it only increased from zero point six of one percent to zero point eight globally protected areas do rebound but it takes a long time to restore 200 year old cows or chickens protected areas provide hope that the creatures of ed wilson 's dream of or the census of marine life will live not just as a list a photograph or a paragraph with scientists around the world i 've been looking at the ninety nine percent of the ocean that is open to fishing and mining and drilling and dumping and whatever such as the arctic we have one chance right now to get it right but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill whales and fish sargasso sea 's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing it 's true too in argentina on the patagonian shelf which is now in serious trouble the high seas where whales tuna and dolphins travel filled with luminous creatures living in dark waters that average two miles deep they flash and sparkle the next ten years may be the most important and the next ten thousand years the best chance our species will have to protect we need new ways to generate power we need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place but nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean our fate we need to do for the ocean what al gore did for the skies above a global plan of action with a world conservation union the iucn is underway to protect biodiversity to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change on the high seas and in coastal areas wherever we can identify critical places new technologies are needed to map photograph and explore the ninety five percent of the ocean that we have yet to see we need maybe an expedition a ted at sea that could help figure out the next steps and so i suppose you want to know i wish you would use all means at your disposal films expeditions the web new submarines and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas how much some some say ten percent some say thirty percent you decide how much of your heart do you want to protect whatever it is a fraction of one percent is not enough and help ensure the survival of what actually as it turns out is my favorite species that would be us for the children of today for tomorrow 's child as never again now is the time"
