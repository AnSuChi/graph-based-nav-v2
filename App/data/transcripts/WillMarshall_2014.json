  "transcript": "needs no introduction it needs no introduction in part because the apollo seventeen astronauts when they were hurtling around the moon and the earth is constantly changing it it 's six it cost eight hundred and fifty five million dollars but if we want to understand it much more regularly we need lots of satellites and this model isn 't scalable so me and my friends we started planet labs to make satellites i 'm going to show you what our satellite looks like and we 've stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package so that even though this is really small and we call this satellite dove thank you we call this satellite dove and we call it dove because satellites are yes we built our first satellite prototype in our garage now this is pretty normal for a silicon valley company that we are but we believe and we and we take a different risk approach we take them we 've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them i think for the first time we call it agile aerospace and that 's what 's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box what has bonded our team over the years is the idea of democratizing access to in fact the founders of our company chris robbie and i we met over fifteen years ago at the united nations when they were hosting a conference and this is what has bonded us our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity you could say we 're space geeks but not only do we care about what 's up there we care about what 's down here too i 'm going to show you a video this is a video taken by the astronaut looking out of the window it gives you a bit of a sense of scale of our two satellites it 's like some of the smallest satellites ever are being launched from the biggest satellite ever and right at the end the solar array glints in the we didn 't just launch two of them like this we launched twenty eight of them it but that 's just the beginning you see we 're going to launch more than one hundred of these satellites like these over the course of the next year and this is what it 's going to do acting in a single orbit plane that stays fixed with respect to the sun the earth rotates underneath they 're all cameras pointed down and they slowly scan across as the earth rotates underneath we 've already got some initial imagery from the satellites it happened to be over uc davis ' campus in california when we turned the camera on but what 's even cooler is when we compare it to the previous latest image of that area and we see buildings are being built thank you we 'll be able to see the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water security from water security to food security this is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago when the satellite was flying over argentina the general point is there are probably hundreds and thousands of applications of this data i 've mentioned a few but there 's others deforestation and we have decided therefore that the best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it we want to ensure everyone can we want to enable the developer community to and we believe that together what would you do with that data what problems would you solve what exploration would you do well thank you very much"
