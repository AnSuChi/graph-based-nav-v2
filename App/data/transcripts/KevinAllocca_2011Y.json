  "transcript": "the trends manager at youtube and i professionally watch youtube videos it 's true so we 're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters we all want to be stars celebrities singers i was younger that seemed so very very hard to do but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world 's culture and of that only a tiny tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment so how does it happen three things tastemakers communities of participation and unexpectedness shot outside his home in yosemite national park in two thousand and ten it was viewed twenty three million times because that 's what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact and so what happened here because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope this is a chart of what it looked like and similar to double rainbow it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere and if you 're wondering about those other spikes those are also fridays well and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it and now there are ten thousand parodies of friday even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week unlike the one way entertainment of the 20th century this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon either by spreading it or by doing something new with it is a looped animation with looped music it 's this just like this it 's been viewed and if you think that that is weird you should know that there is a three hour version of this that 's been viewed four million times even cats were watching this geeky internet culture there were someone made an old timey version and then it went international an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from and who could have predicted any of this who could have predicted double rainbow or rebecca black or nyan cat what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in new york city i admit i wasn 't very interested and so this approach tastemakers creative participating communities complete unexpectedness these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity i mean as mentioned earlier one of the biggest stars in the world right now justin bieber got his start on youtube and these are not characteristics of old media and they 're barely true of the media of today thank you"
