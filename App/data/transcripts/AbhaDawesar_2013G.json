  "transcript": "and i was living on the dark side now maui was terrified of the dark so i had to carry him up the stairs actually down the stairs first the stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries but these were not the major preoccupations of my day even in the rain people stood between madison and 5th avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street had just reminded us and yet here we were obsessed about being wired i think there 's nothing like a crisis to tell you what 's really important and what 's not and sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter and i think that an abstract digital universe has become a part of our identity and i want to talk to you about what i think that means interpretations you and i can experience things without a story we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless but the larger sense that we have of our lives the slightly more abstract one is indirect but it 's embellished a novel needs scene after scene to build and the story of our life needs an arc as well but the story is not about these but it 's because how because of these and sometimes more importantly in spite of these we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves our story therefore needs two dimensions of time a long arc of time that is our lifespan and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment and that 's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time the flow of time is embedded in everything in the erosion of a grain of sand in the budding i think that technology has altered and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers science can do things with and in a picosecond but you and i are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second you and i answer only to nature 's rhythm and flow to the and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past the present and the future to see things for what they are to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations we need time 's arrow to understand cause and effect not just in the material world but in our own intentions and our motivations what happens when that arrow goes awry what happens when time warps so many of us today have the sensation that time 's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once this is because time doesn 't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one news from india is a stream on my smartphone app whether i 'm in new york or new delhi your last job your dinner reservations from last year your former friends lie on a flat plain with today 's friends because the internet also archives and it warps the past the present and the future and the here or there we are left with this moment everywhere this moment that i 'll call the digital now just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now this digital now is not the present because it 's always a few seconds ahead with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones this now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state its focus instead is to distract us at every turn on the road tweet find other people reading those books choice is freedom but not when it 's constantly for its own sake not just is the digital now far from the present but it 's in direct competition with it i i can order foreign language books in the middle of the night shop for parisian macarons and leave video messages that get picked up later at all times i can operate at a different rhythm and and then like an ironic slap in the face it makes it true for example it 's said that there are more people in india with access to cell phones than toilets now if this rift which is already so great in many parts of the world between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology isn 't somehow bridged will be ruptures between the digital and the real for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous how does one live inside distraction we might think that those younger than us those who are born into this will adapt more naturally but i remember my childhood i remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me buda and pest were separated by the danube and vienna had a spanish riding school but it really wouldn 't be the same because and i could feel my grandfather right beside me and pointed out jupiter and saturn and the great bear to me and even here when i look at the great bear i get back that feeling of being a child and i can get back that feeling of being a child again what i had but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact time warping technology challenges our deepest core because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes by archiving everything but time is not data it cannot be stored i wanted to learn to skip and she found i wanted to learn to cook and she kept me in the kitchen cutting cubing and chopping for a whole month and because it will pass and it will move we owe the present moment our full attention attention is time one of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention and definitely from my grandmother love and attention were one and the same thing and in doing so i want to suggest we can choose we 've seen again and again just how creative technology can be and in our lives and in our actions we can choose those solutions and those innovations we can slow down and we can we can choose to take time back thank you"
