  "transcript": "where are you from said the pale tattooed man where are you from the worst attack on america since world war ii pledges to bring our enemies to justice or bring justice surrounded by tire shops and strip joints a bangladeshi immigrant works the register back home but he dreamed of a fresh start in america if he had to work briefly in a mini mart to save up for i t classes and his wedding in two months so be it then on september twenty one that tattooed man enters the mart he holds a shotgun the man doesn 't touch the money where are you from dozens of scalding birdshot pellets he cups a hand over his forehead to keep in the brains on which he 'd gambled everything verses from the koran begging his god to live he senses he is dying he didn 't die his right eye his fiance his landlord kicked him out soon he was homeless and sixty thousand dollars in medical debt including a fee for dialing for an ambulance and years later he would ask what he could do to repay his god and become worthy of this second he would come to believe in fact that this chance called for him to give a second chance to a man we might think deserved no chance at all i was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world moving to the country they had worked so damn hard to out of what i thought might be a six month stint in mumbai stretched to six years i became a writer and found myself amid a magical story the awakening of hope across much of the so called third world i returned to america and realized something the american dream was thriving but only in india i observed that america was fracturing into two distinct societies a republic of dreams i stumbled onto this incredible tale of two lives and of these two americas that brutally collided in that dallas mini mart i knew at once i wanted to learn more and eventually that i would write a book about them for their story was the story of america 's fracturing and of how it might be put back together after he was shot his family in bangladesh begged him come home but he told them he had a dream he found telemarketing work then he became an olive garden waiter because where better to get over his fear of white people than the olive garden now as a devout muslim he refused alcohol didn 't touch the stuff then he learned that not selling it like a budding american pragmatist well god wouldn 't want me to starve would he eventually he landed a six figure job at a blue chip tech company in dallas but as america began to work for raisuddin he avoided the classic error of the fortunate he observed that many with the fortune of being born american were nonetheless trapped in lives that made second chances like his impossible he saw it at the olive garden itself addiction crime he 'd heard a similar tale the closer equally real america the man who shot raisuddin grew up in that mark stroman was always the spark of parties but he 'd always he entered the world bad prisons his mother told him sometimes that little boy would be at school he 'd suddenly pull a knife sometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents ' tenderly feeding horses he was getting arrested before he shaved first juvenile then prison he became a casual white supremacist he found himself on death row for in his two thousand and one he had shot not one death row was the first institution that left stroman better european pen pals prayed with helped him question himself and sent him on a journey of introspection then one day in two thousand and eleven ten years after his crimes stroman received news one of the men he 'd shot the survivor was fighting to save his life eight years after that shooting raisuddin had gone on his own journey a pilgrimage to mecca amid its crowds he felt immense gratitude but also duty he would serve humanity all his days now it was time to pay his debts and he decided upon that his method of payment and how would he intervene by forgiving stroman publicly and then suing the state of texas and its governor rick perry to prevent them from executing stroman exactly like most people shot in the face do yet raisuddin 's mercy was inspired not only by faith a newly minted american citizen he had come to believe that stroman was the product of a hurting america that couldn 't just that insight is what moved me to write my book the true american this immigrant begging america to be as merciful to a native son as it had been to an adopted one not just two men but two americas collided an america that still dreams still strives still imagines that tomorrow can build the tribal fellowship of one 's own narrow kind despite being homeless and traumatized who belonged to that republic of dreams and stroman who belonged to that other wounded country despite being born with the privilege of a native white man i realized these men 's stories formed an urgent parable about america the country i am so proud to call my own wasn 't living through a generalized decline as seen in spain or greece where prospects were dimming for everyone america is simultaneously the most and the least successful country in the industrialized world launching the world 's best companies even as record numbers of children go hungry hit by one of those strokes while leaving the other worryingly perfect on july right after a sobbing raisuddin testified in defense of stroman 's life stroman was killed by lethal injection hours earlier when raisuddin still thought he could still save stroman the two men got to speak for the second time ever here is an excerpt from their phone call i forgive you and i do not hate you i never hated you stroman i love you bro even more amazingly after the execution and offered his help you may have lost a father he told her but you 've gained an uncle he wanted her too to have a second chance if human history were a generous with second chances to the children of other lands today grows miserly with first chances to the children of its own america still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an but it is losing its luster at allowing every american to become a somebody seven million foreigners gained american citizenship remarkable in the meanwhile how many americans gained a place in the middle class go back further and it 's even more the middle class has shrunk mainly because of the people tumbling out of it and my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer than simple inequality what i observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of american life an affluent secession of up up and away into elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix of work money and connections and an impoverished secession of down and out into disconnected dead end lives that the fortunate scarcely see and don 't console yourself that you if you live near if no one in your family serves in the military if if you married once and remain married if you 're not one of sixty five million americans with a criminal record if any or all of these things describe you then accept the possibility that actually you may not know what 's going on and you may be part of the problem other generations had to build a fresh society after slavery pull through a depression defeat fascism in mississippi the moral challenge of my generation i believe is to reacquaint these two americas to choose union over secession once again building slicker apps or starting one more artisanal coffee roasting service it is a moral challenge that begs each of us in the flourishing america to take on the wilting america as our own as raisuddin tried to do in baltimore and oregon and appalachia find new purpose as he did we can immerse ourselves in that other country bear witness to its hopes and sorrows what can you do what can we do how might we build a more merciful country we the greatest inventors in the world can invent solutions to the problems of that instead of shutting down bureaus in its midst instead of ideas from new york and san francisco pray there is the calling of a generation an america whose two halves learn again to stride to plow to forge to dare together a republic of chances"
