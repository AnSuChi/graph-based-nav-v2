  "transcript": "others to pythagoras but the truth is it doesn 't really matter which sage said it first because it 's still it 's pithy but it rings familiar and true doesn 't it know thyself this today i combine all my passions as the ceo of interaxon a thought controlled computing company my goal quite simply is to help people become more in tune with themselves i take it from this little dictum know thyself this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind today minute to minute text conversations e mails relentless exchange of media channels and channels and passwords and apps and reminders and tweets and tags we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place ourselves much of the time we 're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves out into the world and we can barely find the time go far away to the top of a mountain assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter the chaotic everyday and find ourselves again but on that mountain think of the term we use retreat this is the term that armies use when they 've lost a battle it means we 've got to get out of here is this how we feel about the pressures of our world that in order to get inside ourselves you have to run for the hills so my question to you is can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self awareness that we seek can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions know thyself i say the answer is yes and i 'm here today to share a new way that we 're working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before humanizing technology it 's called you may or may not have noticed that i 'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead this is actually a brainwave let me show you what it looks like the green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here you 're actually looking inside my head as i speak they 're actually not very useful for instance what if i could use find out how relaxed i am at any moment or what if i can take that information and put it into an the shape on the right over here has become so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side and the more focused my i would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed i was in any tangible way as we know our feelings about how we 're feeling are notoriously unreliable we 've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn 't deserve it and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier this new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves 're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever but first i want to take a look at how we got here feel free to check in on my head at any time my team at interaxon and i have been developing almost a decade now we were making things activate we brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with and then we were asked to do something really big we were invited to create a massive installation at the vancouver two thousand and ten winter olympics were used in vancouver got to control the lighting on the cn tower the canadian parliament buildings and niagara falls from all the way across the country using their minds over seventeen days at the olympics seven thousand visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the cn tower parliament and niagara in real time with their minds from across the country three thousand km away but we 're always interested in multitiered levels of human interaction and so we began looking into inventing we realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you and it could join into the relationship with you so as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day on the couch the music would mellow with you dimming to darkness as you do we then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you there 's an even more valuable application than that we could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible so the goal of the original game zen bound is to wrap a rope the headset connects wirelessly to an ipad or a smartphone in that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad you control the wooden form that 's on the screen there with your mind the faster the rotation this is for real this is not a fake what 's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats you have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing not just how much rope you used or what your high score is but what was going on inside of your mind and this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what 's going on inside of ourselves think about technology as interactive this technology is it understands what 's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information so you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop at interaxon intra active technology it 's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop for example can teach children with add how to improve their focus perhaps even more importantly the way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with we can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us what once mystified and separated us brainwave technology imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight it would be like plugging into your own personal google on the subject of google today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them you can tag pictures of baby animals as happy or whatever baby animals are to you rather than the keywords that just hint at them or you could tag facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention just like humanizing technology is about taking what 's already natural about the human tech experience it can allow us to make better sense of what we do creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are with humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles when our productivity starts to slacken we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest or what activities brought you joy would you make more time for those people would you prioritize would you get a divorce what thought controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives and with this we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time we can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us the outcome and the character those greeks had some powerful insights they knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase but they understood something more fundamental the delight and fascination that we get from the and being ourselves in it the richness that we get from seeing feeling and knowing the lives that we are the next it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions as i sat easel side watching her transform canvas after canvas i learned that our own inner worlds our ideas emotions and imaginations if you could discover it you could bring it to life to me thought controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush i look forward to the day day that i can sit beside you easel side watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes thank you"
