  "transcript": "to share with you over the next eighteen minutes a pretty incredible idea actually it 's a really big idea but to get us started i want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two but but it wasn 't always that way even here in california if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story people were terrified of this and it was because of scenes like this they can no longer but also their breathing muscles and they were going to spend the rest of their lives and there was no vaccine the disease was so terrifying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late stop this awful disease but and it happened so fast in the united states however that even just last month jon stewart said this that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated bruce aylward oops we made this map for jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists this is the picture but the reason there 's not very much left is because there 's been an extraordinary public private partnership working and this is the reason and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from and in one case it originated on another continent and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like russia where for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years but the message was very clear polio is still a devastating explosive disease it 's just happening in another part of our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis so i want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do we it can explode again if you don 't snuff it out completely this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary it can 't live so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely what the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere and it 's been successful exactly and this is because disease eradication it 's still the venture capital of public health but the pay off motivational it 's absolutely huge one congressman here in the united states thinks that the entire investment that the u s put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every twenty six days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs but and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there 's a few reasons for that the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about twenty years ago so it was a massive effort it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we 've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it 's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it 's not a good vaccine to use on a child it 's not potent it 's not going to protect them but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off with so you can 't see the enemy most of the time and as a result we 've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox we 've had to create one of the there 's over ten million people probably twenty million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last twenty years in what has now been called the largest operation in peacetime these people these twenty million people vaccinate over five hundred million children every single year times at the peak of our operation they 've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky cease fires and truces to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict one reporter who was watching our program in somalia about five years ago a place which has eradicated not once but twice because they got reinfected he was sitting outside of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic but one of the most extraordinary is rotary international this is a group whose army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over twenty years they 're right at the center of the whole thing now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than fifteen years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results were striking and in each of those it was only part of the and then by and then today percent reduction greater than ninety nine percent reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease when we started one thousand children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus last year it was one thousand sars giving measles shots giving but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the international community to reach every single irrespective of geography poverty this virus this ancient virus started to fight back the virus started to spread out of these four places especially we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have like this the vaccine just couldn 't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to frustration let 's call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of public health hang on we should abandon this idea of eradication let 's settle for control that 's good enough the brutal truth is if we don 't have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children then pretty soon there 's absolutely no question these are children like umar he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters umar also has polio umar was paralyzed life his right leg was paralyzed in two thousand and four now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because it 's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk but umar is a fantastic he 's an incredible kid as you probably can 't see the detail here but this is his report card and you 'll see he 's got perfect scores he got one hundred percent in all the important things like nursery rhymes for example there but you know i 'd love to be able to tell you that umar is a typical kid with with polio these days but it 's not true umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances the reality of polio today is something very different polio strikes the poorest because they 're desperately searching and they 're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children we think children deserve and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying we should call it off the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again in northern india we started mapping the cases using satellite the political leaders and the traditional muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence and now they 've even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get every single street we went back to the vaccine it 's a 50 year old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world now june the ninth two thousand and nine we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a game changer the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production and it started rolling off the production lines and into the of children around the world and we didn 't start with the easy places the first place this vaccine was used was in southern afghanistan because it 's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this now here at ted over the last couple of days i 've seen people challenging the audience again to believe in the impossible so this morning at about seven o 'clock i decided that we 'd try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by which proves that the impossible is possible and only two years ago people were saying that this is is the perfect storm when it comes to polio over five hundred thousand children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio uttar pradesh and bihar five hundred thousand children every single month worked half as well as it should have and yet the impossible is happening today marks exactly six months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh or bihar in umar 's home and in the last six months we 've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere we have major the huge social movement that 's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children it 's ready to reach them with bed nets with other things but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started twenty years and it 's the right thing to do but as david cameron of the united kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio there 's never a wrong time to do the right thing and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last twenty years we have a new vaccine we we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease here 's a great idea to spread end polio now help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a where do you think the toughest places are going to be where would you say we need to be the smartest ba the four places where where you saw that we 've never stopped northern nigeria northern india the southern corner of afghanistan and bordering areas of pakistan they 're going to be the the toughest but the interesting thing is of those three india 's looking real good going to get the sense of of how much the campaign costs a year and is it easy to raise that money and what 's it going to be like the next couple of years ba we spend right now about seven hundred and fifty million to eight hundred million dollars a year that 's what it costs to reach five hundred million children it sounds like a lot of money but when you 're reaching five hundred million children multiple times twenty thirty cents to reach a but right now we don 't have enough of that we have a big gap in that money we 're cutting corners and every time we cut corners more places get infected that shouldn 't have and it just slows us down and that great buy costs us a little bit more bg well hopefully we 'll get the word out and the governments will keep their generosity up so thank you"
