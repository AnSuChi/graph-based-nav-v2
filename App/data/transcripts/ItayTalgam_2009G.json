  "transcript": "and i go on the or rather a cubicle an open space cubicle with a lot of space and this is fantastic and it 's so tempting to think that it 's all about me all those great people here not really if it were that i would just so you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want and you have perfect harmony it doesn 't work let 's look at the first video i hope you 'll think it 's a good example of harmony and then speak a little bit about how it comes about so that was a sort of a success now who should we thank for the success i mean obviously the the vienna philharmonic orchestra they don then you have the clapping audience this is the closest to an oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in vienna unlike for example israel where audiences cough all the time you know arthur rubinstein the pianist used to say that anywhere in the world people that have the flu they go to the doctor in tel aviv they come to my concerts but viennese audiences do not do that just to be part of that to become part of the orchestra and that 's great you know make the event but what about the conductor what can you say the conductor was he was happy people get annoyed you come to work how come you 're so happy but he 's spreading happiness and i think the happiness the important thing is this happiness does not come from the joy is about enabling other people 's stories to be heard at the same time and then you have other stories unseen people who build this wonderful concert hall people who made those stradivarius all those beautiful instruments and all those stories are being heard at the same time this is the true experience of a live concert that 's a reason to go out of home yeah let 's see somebody else a great conductor riccardo muti you have to now look at me so not only the instruction is clear but also the sanction what will happen if you don it 's mozart as i understand it and you know what happened to muti please resign you 're using us as let 's look at the next conductor if you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong never look at the trombones it only encourages them so the whole idea is really to let it happen but how does it happen and doesn 't remember his own music because he wrote the music or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them saying come on guys you have to play by the book so it 's not about my story it 's not about your story it 's only the execution of let 's see another and you even the berlin philharmonic doesn 't know when to play and when karajan is asked about it he actually says yes the worst damage i can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction because that would prevent the ensemble the listening why are the eyes closed there is a wonderful story about karajan conducting in london and he cues in a flute player like this the guy has no idea what to do start when you can 't stand it anymore meaning that so you are under tremendous pressure because i don 't give you instruction and yet you have to guess my so it 's a different kind of a very spiritual but yet very firm control can we do it in another way of course we can let 's go back to the first conductor we 've seen carlos kleiber his name next video the not telling them what to do when he does this it 's not he says this is the gesture of the music i 'm it 's like being on a you 're not really given any instructions but the forces of the process itself keep you in place that 's what he does and that 's what makes them into partners you know what to do even though kleiber is not conducting you but here and there and that with sound as you actually take the ride this is very exciting for those players they do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks later but it 's the best the best music making but of course it 's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy you also have to be very professional and look again at this quickly you 'll see what happens when there is a mistake again you see the beautiful body language and now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way second time for the same player and now the third time for the same player wait for me after the concert i have a the authority is there it 's very important but authority is not enough to make people your partners please see what happens here you might be surprised having seen kleiber as such a hyperactive guy is there one hundred percent but not commanding not telling what to do rather enjoying what the soloist is doing another solo now see what you can pick up from this and the second thing is it 's about actually being in control but in a very you know what happens gravitation is no more kleiber not only creates a process but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process and the level in which kleiber is in control so kleiber is about process kleiber is about but you need to have process and content to create the meaning lenny bernstein my own personal maestro since he was a great teacher bernstein always started from the meaning look at the well he had a wonderful expression but only one did you see and you 're playing a painful sound and you look at lenny and but not in a way that you want to stop it 's suffering like enjoying himself in a jewish way as they say but you can see the music on his face you can see the baton left his hand listens to and bernstein enables that isn 't that wonderful and maybe some others you can get to this wonderful point of doing and for the last video i think this is simply the the best title my friend peter says if you love something give it away the the"
