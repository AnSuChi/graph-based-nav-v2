  "transcript": "but when it comes to trusting people something profound is happening please raise your hand if you have ever been a host or a guest on airbnb and please raise your hand if you 've ever used tinder to help you find a mate this one 's really hard to count because you 're kind of going like this these are all examples of how technology is creating i should say with a rather it 's a platform that matches drivers and passengers who want to share the average ride taken is three hundred and twenty kilometers so it 's a good idea to choose your fellow travelers wisely you can see if someone 's a but it turns out that the key social identifier is how much you 're going to talk in the car bla bla you want a nice bit of chitchat and bla bla bla you 're not going to stop talking the entire way from london to paris and yet blablacar transports more than four million people every single month to put that in context that 's more passengers than the eurostar or jetblue airlines carry blablacar is a beautiful illustration of how technology is enabling millions of people across the world to take a trust leap a trust leap happens when we take the risk to do something new or different to the way that we 've always done it i want you to close your eyes man staring at me with his eyes wide open i 'm on this big red circle i can see so close your eyes i 'll do it with you and i want you to imagine there exists a gap between you and something unknown that unknown can be someone you 've just met it can be a place you 've never been to it can be something you 've never tried before you need and that remarkable force is trust and yet we depend on it for our lives to function i trust my children when they say they 're going to turn the lights out at night i trusted the pilot who flew me here to keep me safe without always thinking about what it really means and how it works in different contexts of our lives there are in fact hundreds of definitions of trust and most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment so i define trust a now when you view trust through this lens it starts to explain why it has the unique capacity to enable us to cope with uncertainty to place our faith in strangers to keep moving forward human beings are remarkable at taking trust leaps do you remember the first time you put your credit card details into a website i distinctly remember telling my dad and he rightfully pointed out that the seller 's name was invisible wizard and that this probably was not such a good idea so my work my research focuses on how technology is transforming the social glue of society trust between people so if you trust finding a mate on tinder are you more likely to trust finding a ride on blablacar and i call it climbing the trust stack let me use blablacar as an example to bring it to life on the first level you have to trust the idea so you have to trust the idea of and the third level is about using little bits of information to decide whether the other person is trustworthy it feels weird but we get to a point where these ideas seem totally normal well it turns out that trust only evolved in three significant chapters throughout the course of human history local institutional and what we 're now entering distributed tight knit relationships so say i lived in a village with the first five rows of this audience and we all knew one another say i wanted to borrow money the man who had his eyes wide open he might lend it to me and if i didn 't pay him back you 'd all know i was dodgy i would get a bad reputation and you would refuse to do business with me in the future trust was mostly local and in the mid 19th century society went through a tremendous amount of change people moved to such as london and san francisco and a local banker here was replaced by large corporations that didn 't know us as individuals it 's widely talked about how trust in institutions and many corporate brands has been steadily declining and continues to do so the emissions scandal the fact that only one measly banker went to jail after the great financial crisis and the thing that really surprises me is i mean sincerely apologize when our but what 's happening now runs deeper than the rampant questioning of the size and structure of institutions we 're starting to realize that institutional trust wasn 't designed for the digital age lost and repaired in brands leaders and entire systems is being turned upside down because it forces many of us to have to rethink how trust is built and destroyed even our loved ones i was talking to the ceo of a leading international hotel brand and as is often the case we got onto the topic of airbnb and he admitted to me that he was perplexed by their success he was perplexed at how a company that depends on the willingness of strangers to trust one another could work so well across one hundred and and i said and i 'm sure many of you do this as well i don 't always bother to hang my towels up when i 'm but i would never do this as a guest on airbnb and the reason why i would never do this as a guest on airbnb is because guests know that it 's a simple illustration of how online trust will change our behaviors in the real world make us more accountable in ways we cannot yet even imagine i am not saying we do not need hotels or traditional forms of authority but what we cannot deny and it 's creating this big shift away from the 20th century that was defined by institutional trust towards the 21st century that will be fueled by distributed trust trust it 's being unbundled and inverted it 's no longer opaque and linear a new recipe for trust is emerging that once again is distributed amongst people and the innovative ledger technology underpinning bitcoin mind blowing cryptographic algorithms and hash functions and people called miners who verify transactions all that was created by this mysterious now that is a massive trust leap that hasn 't happened yet but let 's try to imagine this so the economist eloquently described the blockchain as the great chain of being can describe it is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets every time something moves from one place on the register to somewhere else that asset transfer is so the real implication of the blockchain is that it removes the need for any kind of third party such as a lawyer or a trusted intermediary you have to trust the platform now i 've waited to the end intentionally to mention uber because i recognize that it i am not surprised that we are seeing protests from taxi associations all around the world trying to get governments to ban uber based on claims that it is unsafe and he wrote does anyone have details of this # uber app everyone 's talking about heard of it until today the taxi associations sign ups increased by eight hundred and fifty percent now this is a really strong illustration of how once a trust shift has happened around a behavior eleven thing is that both drivers and passengers report that seeing a name and as you may have experienced even behave a little more nicely in the taxi cab uber and didi are early but powerful examples of how technology is creating trust between people in ways and on a scale never possible before many of us are comfortable getting into cars driven by strangers we meet up with someone we swiped right to be matched with we share our homes with people we do not know this is just the beginning because the real disruption happening isn 't i want to help people understand this new era of trust thank you very much"
