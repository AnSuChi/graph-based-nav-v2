  "transcript": "and then there 's the life that only i see and in the life that everyone sees i 'd probably say some of those same things i wouldn 't be lying but i wouldn 't totally be telling you the truth either because the truth is that 's just the life everyone else sees who i really am is someone who struggles intensely with depression i have for the last six years of my life and i continue to every day for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn 't really know what that means that might surprise them to hear because there 's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when when you break up with your girlfriend when you lose a loved one when you don 't get the job you wanted but that 's sadness that 's a natural thing that 's a natural human emotion real depression isn 't being sad real depression is being sad when that 's real depression and that 's what i suffer from and to be totally honest that 's hard for me to stand up here and say it 's hard for me to talk about and it seems to be hard for everyone to and so because we don 't see it we don 't see the severity of it every thirty seconds every thirty seconds somewhere someone in the world takes their own life and it might be two blocks away it might be two countries away it might be two continents away but it 's happening and it 's happening every single day and we have a tendency as a society to look at that and go so what so what we look at that and we go that 's your problem that 's their problem we say we 're sad and we say we 're sorry but we also say so what because i sat on the edge of my bed i was suicidal and if you were to look at my life on the surface you wouldn 't see a kid who was suicidal you 'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team the drama and theater student of the year the english student of the year someone who was consistently on the honor roll and you would be wrong so i sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and i thought about taking my own life and i came this close to doing it and i didn 't so that makes me one of the lucky ones one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump and that just leaves me with my story and my story is this in i suffer from depression i was living two totally different lives where one person was always afraid of the other i was afraid that people would see me for who i really was that i wasn 't the perfect popular kid in high school everyone thought i was that beneath and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger i feared my truth i feared my honesty i feared my vulnerability and that fear made me feel like i was forced into a corner like i i thought about it every single day and if i 'm being totally honest standing here i 've thought about it again since that 's the struggle that 's depression and depression isn 't chicken pox you don 't beat it once and it 's gone forever it 's something you live with it 's something you live in it 's the roommate you can 't kick out it 's the voice you can 't ignore it 's the feelings you can 't seem to escape the scariest part is that after a while it becomes normal for you and what you really fear the most isn 't the suffering it 's the shame it 's the embarrassment it 's the disapproving look on a friend 's face it 's the whispers in the hallway that you 're weak it 's the comments that you 're crazy that 's what keeps you from getting help that 's what makes you hold it in and hide it it 's the so you hold it in and you hide it and you hold it in and you hide it and even though it 's keeping you in bed every day and it 's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it you hide it because the stigma in our society around depression is very real it 's very real and if you think that it isn 't ask yourself this would you rather make your next facebook status say you 're having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you 're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you 're but if you tell people you 're depressed everyone runs the other way that 's the stigma we are so so so accepting of any body part breaking down and that 's ironic to me because we just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it 's not there and hope it 'll fix itself well it it hasn 't and it 's not going to because that 's wishful thinking and wishful thinking isn 't a game plan it 's procrastination and we can 't procrastinate on something this important the first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one well we haven 't done that so we can 't really expect to find an answer when we 're still afraid of the question and i don i think it has to start here it has to start with me it has to start with it has to start with the people who are suffering the ones who are hidden in the shadows we need to speak up and shatter the silence we need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in because if there 's one thing that i 've come to realize if there 's one thing that i see as the biggest problem it 's not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others it 's in building a world where we teach the acceptance we see that we all struggle and we all suffer whether it 's with this whether it 's with something else we all know what it is to hurt we all know what it is to have pain in our heart and we all know how important it is to heal but right now depression is society 's deep cut that we 're content to put a band aid over and pretend it 's not there well it is there it is there and you know what it 's okay depression is okay if you 're going through it know that you 're okay and know that you 're sick you and it 's an issue not an identity because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others you can see depression for what it really is and that 's just a part of life just a part of life and as much as i hate as much as i hate some of because yeah it 's put me in the valleys but only to show me there 's peaks and yeah it 's dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light my pain more than anything in nineteen years on this planet has given me perspective and my hurt my hurt has forced me to have hope because the world i believe in is one where embracing your light doesn 't mean ignoring your dark the world i believe in is one where we 're measured by our ability to overcome adversities not avoid them the world i believe in is one where i can look someone in the eye and it 's okay because depression is okay we 're people we 're people and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness then i 'm here to tell you and stop the silence and we need to take away the taboos and start talking because the only way we 're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together by standing strong together"
