  "transcript": "and i had a high school science teacher who would say to the class the it 's very remote it 's very dry and it 's very beautiful it 's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology and our ancestors for as long as there 's been recorded history have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence and we 're no exception our generation it 's no exaggeration to say that the southern hemisphere is going to be the future we have an array of existing telescopes already in the andes mountains in chile there will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes sensitive to optical and then there will be telescopes in space there 'll be a successor to the hubble space telescope it 's called the james webb telescope and it will be launched in two thousand and eighteen there i 've been leading a group a consortium international group to build what will be when it 's finished or gmt so it dwarfs this stage maybe out to the fourth row in this audience each of the seven mirrors in this telescope will be almost in diameter together the seven mirrors in this telescope the whole telescope will stand about forty three meters high and again and it 's going to be housed in an enclosure that 's twenty two stories sixty meters but it 's an unusual building to protect this telescope it will have open windows to the sky be able to point and look at the sky and it will actually rotate on a base two thousand tons of rotating building and it may for the first time ever be capable of finding life on planets outside of our solar system it 's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe it 's a telescope that 's going to allow us to peer back witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling the first black holes in the universe the first galaxies and as we 've learned over the centuries since galileo galilei the italian scientist first turned we 've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding and our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion so we 're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos that 's ever been taken it was taken using the hubble space it 's only and there are now ten thousand galaxies visible within that image and each of those galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars the further back we see in time so larger the bucket the larger the mirror we have the more light we can see and the farther back we can view we 've even learned that there 's dark matter and dark energy that we can 't see so you 're looking now at an actual image of dark matter you got it not all audiences get that so the way we infer the presence of dark matter we can 't see it but there 's an unmistakable tug we now can look out we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that 's expanding 1990s used the hubble space telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding we can now trace we 've learned over time that stars have individual histories that is they have birth they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths so the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see most of which turn out to have planets going around them and one of the really surprising results in the last twenty years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars these are called exoplanets but now there are almost two thousand other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect measure masses for there are five hundred of those that are multiple planet systems and there are four thousand and still counting other candidates for planets orbiting other stars they come in a bewildering variety of different kinds there are water worlds and there are rocky planets like the earth so around our own planet we know there 's life we 've and given all that we 've discovered the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions perhaps maybe even hundreds of millions of other [ planets ] that are close enough just the right distance from their stars that they 're orbiting to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support so we marvel now at those odds the overwhelming odds and the amazing thing is that within the next decade the gmt may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets and determine whether or not they have the potential for life south that the newest partner in our telescope is brazil including the smithsonian and the carnegie institutions and the universities of arizona so the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating in its own right take chunks of glass melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating nobody know it 's happening and there 's essentially a rotating cauldron if you think about the precision of these mirrors the bumps on the mirror over the entire amount to less than so can you visualize that of the width of one of my hairs over this entire it 's what allows us to have the precision that we will have so the gmt if you can imagine if i were to hold i can see from here my guess that even in the front row you can 't see that if i were standing in so paulo we could resolve the face that 's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope and if if we were and lit a candle a single candle then we would be able to detect it using the gmt quite extraordinary this is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy nearby is astronomical it 's all relative it 's tens of millions of light years away you can see faint detail that starts to come through finally and look how dramatic this is this is what the gmt will see what the gmt will see we blasted that off we 've tested and polished the first mirror we 've cast the second and the third mirrors and we 're about to cast the fourth mirror we had a series of reviews this year international panels that came in and reviewed us and said you 're ready to go to construction and so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors we want to get on the air quickly the cosmic dawn we 'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail but for me one of the most exciting things about building the gmt is the opportunity to actually discover something that we don 't know about that we can 't even imagine at this point something completely new and my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities thank you very much have a question for you you mentioned so the magellan telescope is going up but also alma and others in chile and elsewhere including in hawaii is it about but what about the in terms of the science they 're very complementary the telescopes that are in space the telescopes on the ground telescopes with different wavelength capability telescopes even that are similar but different instruments they will all look at different parts of the questions that we 're asking so when we discover other planets we 'll be able to test those observations we 'll be able to measure the atmospheres be able to look in space with very high resolution so but scientifically it 's very complementary"
