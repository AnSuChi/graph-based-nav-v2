  "transcript": "i 'm the director of nutrition services for the berkeley unified school district i have ninety employees and seventeen locations nine thousand six hundred kids i 'm doing seven thousand one hundred meals a day and i 've been doing it for two years trying to change how we feed kids in america and and that 's what i want to talk to you a little bit about today these are some of my kids with a salad bar i put salad bars in all of our schools when i got there everyone says it couldn 't be done little kids couldn 't eat off the salad bar big kids would spit in it neither happened when i took over this i tried to really figure out like what my vision would be how do we really change children 's relationship to food and i 'll tell you why we need to change it but we absolutely have to change it and what i came to understand is we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet healthy food and healthy kids and that if we don 't do that the antithesis although we 've heard otherwise is we 're really going to become extinct because we 're feeding our children to death that 's my premise we 're seeing sick kids get sicker and the way the usda puts food on kids ' plates that 's unhealthy and allows unhealthy food into schools and by tacitly all of us send our kids or grandchildren or nieces or you know learn what 's in those schools and when you feed these kids bad food that 's what they 're learning so that 's really what this is all about we now live in a country where most of us don 't decide by and large what we eat we see big businesses monsanto and dupont who brought out agent orange and stain resistant carpet they control ninety percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country these are ten companies and the very first thing was about regional food trying to eat food from within our region and clearly with what 's going on with fossil fuel usage or when as the fossil fuel is going you know we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should or could be moving food one thousand five hundred miles before we eat it but we as a nation have to start thinking about consuming growing and feeding our children food that 's not chock full of chemicals we can 't keep feeding our and the results of that are kids getting sick we are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein and the result of it is we have diseases we have things like e coli that we can 't fix that we can 't make kids better when they get sick and you know certainly antibiotics have been one of my favorite facts is that u s agriculture uses one point two billion pounds of pesticides every year that means every one of us and our children consumes what would equal a five pound bag those bags you have at home if i had one here and ripped it open and that pile i would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply because of the way we allows these antibiotics these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply and the usda paid for this ad in time magazine okay we could talk about rachel carson and ddt the usda cannot be seen as the the antithesis of this whole thing that 's what i really try and get people to understand i really try and teach it to kids i think it 's the most important it 's consuming food in a way in which kids will grow up to be healthy and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we 're seeing in less than two hundred years you know just in a few generations we 've gone from being two hundred and we spend thirty five thousand dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison and you know we have criminals we 're getting sick and our kids are getting sick it is about what we feed them what goes in is what we are we really are what we eat and if we continue down this path if we continue to feed kids bad food if we continue not to teach them what good food is you know what is going to happen what 's going to happen to our whole medical system what 's going to happen is we 're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own eight year olds today one out of every three caucasians one out of every two african americans and hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime well the cdc has gone further to say that those children born in the year two thousand could be the first generation in our country 's history to die at a younger age than their parents and it 's because of what we feed them because maybe they 're responsible for what kids eat twenty billion dollars a year ten thousand ads most kids see the result of which is you know that everybody thinks they should be eating more and more and more this is the usda portion size that little tiny thing and the one over there that 's bigger than my head is what mcdonald 's and burger king and those big companies think we should eat and why can they serve that much why can we have cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non nutrient foods really really cheap which is why i say it 's a social justice now i said i 'm doing this in berkeley and you might think oh berkeley of course you can do it in berkeley well this is the food i found twenty four months ago this is not even food this is the stuff we were feeding our kids extremo burritos corn dogs grilled cheese sandwiches everything came in plastic in cardboard the only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter the only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher because if it didn 't come in a can it came frozen in a box the usda allows this the usda allows all of this stuff in case you can 't tell that 's like pink danish and some kind of cupcakes chicken nuggets and we all of us have to understand that this is about us that we can make a but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart you know what 's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken but this is what most schools you know that vegetables that you know we have to change the way we teach kids about these things there 's a lot of stuff we can do there 's a lot of schools doing farm to school programs we have no high fructose corn syrup no trans fats no processed foods we 're cooking from scratch every day we have twenty five percent of our thank you twenty five percent of our stuff is organic and local we cook those are my hands i get up at four a m every day and go cook the food for the kids because this is what we need to do we can 't keep serving kids processed the generation after to be able to think like this if they 're not nourished if they 're eating now one of the things that what happened when i went into berkeley is i realized that you know this was all pretty amazing very different and i needed to market it i came up with these calendars that i sent home to every parent and these calendars really started to lay out my program now i 'm in charge of all the cooking classes and so this is a typical menu this is what we 're serving this week at the schools and you see these recipes on the side those are the recipes that the kids learn and we serve them in the cafeterias now you 've probably garnered that i don 't love the usda and i don 't have any idea what to do with their pyramid this upside down pyramid with a rainbow over the top i the really tiny hamburger we have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference maybe two of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer what are kids learning where is the family time where is socialization where is discussion where is learning to they go up and and we have to pull it all together we have to teach kids about in school and we need to be one of the things i do a lot is who are really willing to work to go into schools schools are underfunded most schools in america spend less than seven thousand five hundred dollars a year teaching a child that comes down to under five dollars an hour most of you spend so we 're spending less than five dollars an hour on the educational system and if we 're going to change it and change how we feed kids we really have to rethink that so public and private partnerships advocacy groups working with foundations in our school district the way we afford this is our school district allocates percent of the general fund towards nutrition services and i think if every school district allocated a half to one we really need to change it it 's going to take more money it 's sort of this duh thing you know if you have kids coming into lunch and all they 're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess you see them just throw away their lunch can run outside and then at one in the afternoon they 're totally crashing these are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up because they haven 't had lunch we need to we need to educate we need to educate the kids we and you know i 'm not that better but we really have to educate we have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again because of course they don 't because we 've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long we need 40 minute lunches most that is not lunchtime it 's crazy what we 're doing and just remember at very least tacitly i think if we 're going to fix one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the national school lunch program instead of the national school lunch program being under the usda i think it should be under cdc if we started to think about food and we started thinking about food as health then i think we wouldn 't have corn dogs as lunch this and this i 'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece because i think this is something we all have to understand the national school lunch program spends eight billion dollars feeding thirty million children a year that number probably needs to double people say oh my god where are we going to get eight billion in this country we 're spending one hundred and ten billion dollars a year we spend two hundred billion dollars a year on diet related illness today with nine percent of our kids having type two diabetes two hundred billion it 's not a lot that eight billion comes down to two dollars and that means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools most schools eighty to ninety cents in so we 're spending less than a dollar ok on lunch now i don 't know but i go to starbucks and pete 's and places like that and venti latte in san francisco is five dollars one gourmet coffee one is more we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week you know what we should be ashamed we as a country should be ashamed at that the richest country in it 's the kids that need it the most who get this really really lousy food it 's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can 't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick those are the same kids who we should be taking care of"
