  "transcript": "and all the headlines were about european countries getting downgraded by rating agencies and why is everybody so upset about their work if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that i would devote the next years to trying to reform them but guess what 's really crazy and i would like to explain to you not only why it 's time to change this but also how we can do it so let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do as you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money and it can go down to the level of the which means it 's a fairly risky investment rating agencies are rating but they can also rate countries and i can tell as you 're listening to me right now you 're thinking so why should i really care about this right be honest ratings affect you they affect all of us if a rating agency rates a country it basically assesses and evaluates a country 's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt so if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency then the country has less available for other services like roads schools and this is the reason why you should care accessible the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players and fitch there is no incentive the second you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer the third point is the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings but for ratings a crucial element of our economy we really do not know what all the different and we need to change this i think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul not just a trimming at the margins and this is why we at the bertelsmann foundation have invested a lot of time and effort and we call it by its acronym incra incra would make a difference to the current system by adding another nonprofit player to the mix it would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available but this is not enough to make a difference right and it would include many stakeholders from society incra would not only be a european or an american rating agency it would be a truly international one in which in particular the emerging economies on a broader set of indicators if we conduct a sovereign rating we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country who is cultivating the economic soil of a country right and this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward looking indicators i hope you would agree it 's important for you to know if your government important for you to know if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it 's promised for example if incra would rate south africa right now of course we would take a very very close look at the youth unemployment of the country the highest in the world if over seventy percent of a country 's population under the age of thirty five is unemployed of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future but guess what we do not know and this leads me to the third big difference that incra would make so in contrast to the current system so in a nutshell incra would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition and it would also increase the quality but i tell you it 's because sovereign ratings affect all of us and they should be addressed and should be defined and this is why we are testing our model right now and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring incra to life and that we have the unique opportunity right now because for way too long we have left the big financial players on their own thank you"
