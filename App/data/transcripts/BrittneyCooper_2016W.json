  "transcript": "what if i told you that time we talk about race in terms it 's almost as if my mother for if time had a race it would be white white people i know i we go ahead with our enlightened progressive selves and relegate useless concepts like race to the dustbins of history perhaps we should lock up our concepts of race in a time capsule peer at them with the clearly more enlightened raceless versions of ourselves that belong to the future in the ways we attempt to argue that the future that we hope for is the present in which we 're currently living many americans declared that we were from the academy where we 're enamored with being terms to mark the way we were but prefixes alone don 't have the power to make race and racism a thing of the past the us was never pre race latinos or the indigenous is disingenuous just about the moment we were preparing to celebrate our our political conditions became the most racial they 've been in the last fifty years so today i want to offer to you three observations about the past the present and the future of time as it relates to the combating of racism time has a history and so do black people but we treat time as though it is timeless as though it has always been this way as though it doesn 't have a political history bound up with the plunder of indigenous lands the genocide of indigenous people when white male european philosophers first thought to conceptualize time and history one famously declared is no historical part of the world this idea that black people have had no impact on history is one of the foundational ideas of white supremacy g woodson created negro history it 's the reason that we continue to celebrate black history month in the us every february we also see this idea that black people are people either alternately outside of the bounds of time or stuck in the past and a person why can 't you move on we have a black president we 're past all that william faulkner famously said the past is never dead it 's not even past but my good friend professor kristie dotson says our memory is longer than our lifespan we don 't have the luxury of letting go but sometimes our political conditions are so troubling that we don 't know if we 're living in the past or we 're living in the present take for instance when black lives matter protesters go out to protest unjust killings of black citizens by police and the pictures emerge from the protest look like they could have been taken fifty years ago the past won 't let us go but still let us press our way into the present at present i would argue that the racial struggles we are experiencing are clashes over time and space what do i mean well those in power dictate the pace of the workday they dictate how much money our time is actually worth lipsitz argues that white people even dictate the pace of social inclusion they dictate how long it will actually take for minority groups to receive the rights that they have been fighting for let me loop back to the past quickly to give you an example if you think about the civil rights movement and the cries of its leaders for freedom now they were challenging the slow pace of white social inclusion by the year the voting rights act was passed there had been a full one hundred years between the end of the civil war and the conferral of voting rights on african american communities despite the urgency of a war conservative state legislatures across the us have ramped up attempts to roll back african american voting rights by passing restrictive voter id laws and curtailing early voting opportunities this past july a federal court struck down north carolina 's voter id law saying it african americans with surgical precision african american inclusion in the body politic is a primary way that we attempt to manage and control but another place that we see these time space clashes brooklyn philadelphia new orleans and washington dc places that have had black populations for generations these communities are pushed out in service of bringing them into the 21st century what happens when a person who exists in time meets someone who only occupies space space takers and those who are perceived to be those who control the flow and thrust of history are considered world makers who own and master time he implied that it was merely a voluminous land mass taking up space at the bottom of the globe africans were white people continue to control the flow and thrust of history while too often treating black people as though we are merely taking up space to which we are not entitled time and the march of progress is used to justify a stunning degree of violence towards our most vulnerable populations who being perceived as shortened life span according to zip code is just one example of the ways that time and space cohere in an unjust manner in the lives of black people children who are born in new orleans zip code seventy thousand one hundred and twenty four which is ninety three percent white thousand one hundred and twelve which is sixty percent black children born in washington dc 's wealthy maryland suburbs can expect to live a full twenty years longer than children born in its downtown neighborhoods ta nehisi coates argues that the defining feature of being drafted into the black race is the inescapable robbery of time but as personal lost quality of time with loved ones and lost years of healthy quality of life do black people what if your group is the group for whom a future these time space clashes between protesters and police between gentrifiers and residents don 't paint a very pretty picture of what america hopes for black people 's future if the present is any indicator our children will be under educated health maladies will take their toll and housing will continue to be unaffordable so if we 're really ready perhaps we should begin by admitting that we 're out of time we black people have always been out of time time does not belong to us our lives are lives of perpetual urgency time is used to displace us or conversely we are urged into complacency through endless calls to just be patient but if past is prologue let us seize upon the ways in which we 're always out of time anyway to demand with urgency we have to decide that time belongs to all of us but we can decide that the time we do get is just and free we can we can stop stealing time from black people through long periods of incarceration for nonviolent crimes the police can stop stealing time and black lives i believe the future is what we make it but we can 't get there on colored people 's time or white time or your time or even my time"
