  "transcript": "i start speaking english learning english about a year ago i speak french so my english is franglais i 'm born in but what i 've been doing when i was about and my father was a what i 've been doing from fourteen to seventeen was i was assisting them collecting meat and whatever they were killing poaching hunting in the forest bring it in the main city to get access to the market and i wanted to do it because and for i applied to my area don 't have better health care i want to be a doctor to serve them i did tropical ecology and plant botany i went to the ituri forest for my internship it 's where i really getting passion with what i 'm doing right up to now i 'm standing in front of you doing botany and wildlife conservation that time the ituri forest was created as a forest reserve and the training center there was built around the scientific congolese staff and some american scientists also so the okapi faunal reserve protects number i think and it has been named that is a forest giraffe i think you guys know it quite well here we have savanna it has also thirteen species and it has the ituri forest itself i joined the wildlife conservation society working there but i started working with them as a student in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one i was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university because i accomplished with honor and i wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center with the end of the dictatorship regime of mobutu sese seko that most of you know life became very very difficult and the work we have been doing so mobutu soldiers and the okapi so there was a road from so they might go through pass through the okapi faunal reserve congo has five of the world 's richest sites so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve you can 't believe and it was for us the young the first time really we hear they didn 't believe they were killing people they were doing whatever they want because they have power who have been doing that but i was from the west working in the east you can 't speak lingala because lingala was we have been doing research on botany and we have a small herbarium of four thousand five hundred purpose so that we start them for agriculture for medicine for whatever and for science for the study of the flora and the change of the forest that is people moving around that 's even pygmies and this is a bright guy person and pygmy i 've been working with him about they went to the forest for poaching elephants because he 's in the forest he has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest they came to told me i have to save him and what i did i gave him just antibiotics that we care for i saved his life and that was the language of the war constant extraction of mineral killing animals the logging timbers and so on and what of important things i think all of you here have a cell phone five millions of congolese have gone because of this they call it coltan phones and it has been in that area all over in congo extraction and good big business of the war i buried some of our and they didn 't go to school i packed it and that is me going to hurrying to save that four thousand material with people i housed that four thousand material at the and after the war i have been able to bring it back home so that we continue our studies the second war came while we didn 't and having some good music with worldspace radio when it started i think so it was so bad we heard that now from the east again the war started and the reserve was a target to the and there was no way to to work and that 's the what 's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks and they can 't do what they are doing so we went to meet them that is mining there are regulations but they said you guys you think that soldiers who are dying are we don 't think so we have to do it because to let our movement advance i say no way you are not going to do it here we started talking with them and i was tried to protect our equipment tried to protect our staff and the villages of about one thousand five hundred people and we continued but i was doing that and sometimes they talk to my own language that is lingala i hear it and what strategy they are doing they are planning sometimes they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on they used me to carry and where i had only this equipment my satellite phone my computer and a plastic and every time daily after we have meeting what i don 't know how many people i had on my and the afternoon and one day we went for a meeting sorry he had the same and he asked me do you know how to use this i said i have never seen it i they didn not and i was sending news what have been going and for that they have been having big pressure to leave to free the area because there was no way whatever and one of them was pregnant and during the war after a week of heavy war we had the first okapi this is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this this is not local population this is rebels they are now happy sending the news that they have protected the okapi with the war because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere after a week we celebrated the they killed an elephant just fifty meters to the area where the zoo where okapi was born and i until i do my my report and then i see and i succeeded the elephant just decayed and they just got the the tusks what we are doing after that that was the i devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium because we didn 't have good and start fundraising money to where i 've been going i had opportunity to go all over where herbarium for my african material is and they supported me a bit i built this now it 's doing work to train young congolese and also what one of the speciality we are doing and what the impacts of the ituri forest is playing to uptake carbon this is one of the studies we are doing on tagged and that is i think it i don 't know where to start where to but now i think that i would have titled it the language of guns where are you people now we are talking about reconstitution rebuild africa is gun industries or is it a game i think but see what it 's doing see what is see what i don 't think that someone may blame google because it 's doing the right things thank you amazing story i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have how can we help you corneille ewango that 's really embarrassing i think that now i feel nervous and but there are few who are going it 's by building capacities how many have got opportunity like me to go to u s do a master 's and go now i 'm in the netherlands to do a ph d but many of them are just here because they don 't have money building capacities for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for africa"
