  "transcript": "you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again we at berkeley bionics call these robots exoskeletons and it will give you extra strength and it will help you for instance to manage your balance it is actually the true integration but not only that it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there this is just not some blue sky thinking to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldier that on average does carry about one hundred obviously this is resulting thirty percent of them so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an crawls and high agility and then augments my strength and endurance eythor bender we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this so this is for real now let 's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users something and that 's actually a conservative estimate we are talking here about oftentimes very young individuals with spinal cord injuries that in the prime of but it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers and the only option pretty much when it 's stroke or other complications is the wheelchair and that is actually for the last five hundred years so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility let me now introduce you to elegs that is worn by amanda boxtel and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for nineteen years until now sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back there are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips well as her knee joints that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait ab i was twenty four years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me in a split second i lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis and he said amanda you 'll never walk again and that was nineteen yeas ago he robbed adaptive technology has since but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk until now we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you it and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations not only for the soldiers but for everyone"
