  "transcript": "the most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us this perfect storm is and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology and that 's very understandable now this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population rising towards ten billion but fossil fuels carbon coal and gas are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change desertification is a fancy word and this happens only when but i have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine we have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year on those it is almost impossible and we have environments fortunately with space technology now we can look at it from space and when we do i would guess of the world is desertifying i took this picture in the tihamah desert while twenty five millimeters that 's an inch of rain was falling think of it in terms of drums of water each containing two hundred liters over one thousand drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day the next day the land looked like this where had that water gone exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered now because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter now you 're told and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence now we know that desertification is caused by livestock cattle sheep and goats overgrazing the plants leaving the soil bare and giving off methane almost everybody knows this from nobel laureates to golf caddies or was taught it as i was now and i loved and so i grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing we were wrong then and i want to invite you now to come along on my journey when i was a young man a young biologist in africa i was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks now no sooner no sooner did we remove the hunting drum beating people to protect the animals than the land began to deteriorate as you see in this park now no livestock were involved but suspecting that we had too many elephants now i did the research and i proved we had too many and i recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain and it was political dynamite frankly so our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research we shot forty thousand elephants to try to stop the damage and i will carry that to my grave one good thing did come out of it it made me absolutely determined to devote my life i got a shock to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in africa and i found that american scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural so i then began looking but i found the opposite as we see on this research by two thousand and two had changed to that situation and the authors of the position paper on climate change from which i obtained these pictures attribute this change to unknown processes clearly we have never understood what is causing desertification has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally we have never understood it and i promise you you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it 's just covered with litter plant litter now by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on but we have just simply not understood why was it why has it accelerated lately we had no understanding of that what we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world the soil and the vegetation and that and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil as we see where a herd has passed this picture and watch the change as it goes into this long dry season all of that grass you see aboveground and this smothers and kills grasses releasing carbon to prevent that we have traditionally used fire but fire also burning one hectare of grassland gives off more and more damaging and we are burning in africa every single year and almost nobody is talking about it we justify the burning as we cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change what are we going to do there is only one option and to use livestock and mimic nature there is no other alternative left to mankind we 'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature and look at that all of that grass is now covering the soil as dung urine and litter or mulch as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand without using fire to damage the soil and the plants are free to grow when i first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification i was faced with a real dilemma how were we to do it we then we 'd had and as you see in this picture clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals but we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this and i found there were planning techniques that i could take and adapt to our biological need and from those i developed what we call holistic economic complexity today we have young women like this one teaching villages in africa how to put their animals together into predator friendly manner because we have a lot of lands and so on let 's look at some results this is land close to land that we manage in zimbabwe but as you can see all of that rain almost of all it has evaporated from the soil surface now let 's go to our land nearby on the same day with the same rainfall and look at that our river is flowing and healthy and clean it 's fine and we have virtually no fear of dry years and we did that by increasing the cattle and goats four hundred percent planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants buffalo giraffe and other animals that we have but before we began our land looked like that this site was bare and eroding for over thirty years regardless of what rain we watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature and there are fallen trees in there now because the better land is now attracting elephants etc and i 've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound i began helping a family in the karoo desert in and look at the amazing change in this one where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature and once more we have the and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers thousand sheep in one flock we now have in the violent horn of africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture i remind you that i am talking about most of the world 's land here where only animals can feed people from about ninety five percent of the land what we are doing globally causing climate change as much as i believe fossil fuels and maybe more and as i am i believe i 've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this we are and if we just do that on about half while feeding people i can think of almost nothing and all of humanity thank one quick question when you first start this and you bring in a flock of of animals it 's desert what do they eat how does that part work we have done this for a long time and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation where i offered a five note in a hundred mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred mile drive and on that we trebled the stocking rate the number of animals in the first year with no feeding just by the movement mimicking nature and using a sigmoid curve the best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and i want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk as wonderful ca"
