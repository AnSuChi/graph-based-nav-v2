  "transcript": "i love photography i love rockets i 'm going to talk about a hobby that can scale and show you photos i 've taken over the years with kids like these that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually a richard branson or diamandis my son designed a rocket that became stable a golf ball rocket i thought it was quite an interesting experiment in piercing the big dipper and the milky way then fly them with onboard computers to verify performance to launch the big stuff you go to the middle of nowhere black rock desert where dangerous things happen the boys and the rockets get bigger they use motors watching the spectacle it 's a strange kind of love with my photos if you want to learn about this participate be a spectator we had to call it rocket mavericks this one was great went to one hundred thousand feet actually it went eleven feet into solid clay and became a sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down to take this shot i did what i often do which is go way beyond the pads where none of the spectators are and if we can run the video i 'll show you what it took to get this dreamworks shot and that 's me over there taking photos the whole way some people watch this because of a nascar like fascination with things bumping and grinding burning the parachute as it fell that was last weekend this guy went up went supersonic ripped the fin can off the art sale in the sky a burning metal hunk coming back these things dropped down from above all through the weekend of rocket launch after rocket launch it 's a cadence you can 't quite imagine why do it for things like this gene from alabama drives out there seeing a thin blue line of space it is this breathtaking image success of course that motivates us understand rocket science understand the importance of physics and math and in many ways to have that awe at exploration of the frontiers of the unknown thank you"
