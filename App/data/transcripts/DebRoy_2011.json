  "transcript": "imagine if you could record your life so you could go back or sift through traces of time and well that 's exactly the journey this is my wife and collaborator rupal and on this day at this moment we walked into the house with our first child our beautiful baby we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system okay deb roy this moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house dining room and all of these fed into a disc array so here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through lights out so you 're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video what this data represents for our family at a personal level which was to use this we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at mit so we could start teasing apart patterns trying to understand the influence of social so we 're looking here at one of the first things we started to do this is my wife and i cooking and as we move through space and through time a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen in order to convert ninety thousand hours of video into something that we could start to see we use motion analysis to pull out as we move through space and through time what we call space time worms and this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data and with it trace the pattern of in particular so that we could focus our transcription efforts all of the speech environment and over time the words he began to produce so with that technology and that data and the ability to with machine assistance transcribe speech we 've now transcribed well over seven million words of so you 've all i 'm sure seen time lapse videos where a flower will blossom as my son soon after his first birthday would say gaga so we 're going to cruise through half a year so you can focus on the sound the acoustics of a new kind of trajectory gaga to water over the we 've identified interpret this apparently simple graph is on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances and the [ horizontal ] axis is time we aligned based on the following idea every time my son would learn a word we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contained that word and we would plot the relative length of the utterances and what we found was this curious phenomena making language as simple as possible and then slowly ascend back up in complexity and the amazing thing was that bounce that dip lined up almost precisely with when each word was born word after word systematically so it appears that all three primary caregivers myself my wife and our nanny subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language and the implications of this there are many but one i just want to point out is that there must be amazing but the environment is learning from him that environment people are in these tight feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding but that 's looking at the speech context what about the visual context we 're not looking at think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of the reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe what i 'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of thirty minutes again of just life in the living room that 's me and there 's video analytics that are tracking our movements my son is leaving red ink i am leaving green ink we 're now on the couch looking out through the window at cars and we see these amazing structures these little knots of two colors of of thread we call social hot spots the spiral thread and we think that these affect the way language is learned what we 'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they 're learned so in other words the relationship between words and what they 're about in the world so here 's how she offers water and what we 've done is use the word water to tag that moment that bit of activity and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co occurred with an instance of water and what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape this is the wordscape for the word water and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen that 's where those big peaks are we can take the word bye and we look and we find as you would expect a contrast in the landscape where the word bye occurs much more in a structured way so we 're using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition and that this has become my favorite way of videographing just about any space philip has been a close collaborator on all the visualizations you 're student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis and he made the following observation and we can apply it to the world of public media and so our effort took an unexpected turn think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place we 've started analyzing television content using the same principles analyzing event structure of a tv signal and we 're now with satellite dishes pulling and analyzing a good part of all the tv being watched in the united states and you don 't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people 's conversations the common ground that the words are about coming out of the television feeds you 've got the conversations that are about those topics and through semantic analysis and this is actually real data you 're looking at from our data processing each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and we get instead the context the common ground activities and what we 're seeing here these skyscrapers now are commentary that are linked but looking at very different sphere and and just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a in a family we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people this is a subset of data from our database just fifty thousand out of several million and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources so we have the programs and the the sporting events and the commercials and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph and then the important third dimension each of the links that you 're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between and there are again now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue so if we for example trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it and then we follow where that comment goes and then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content a very interesting structure becomes visible we call this a causes someone to talk they talk to other people that drives tune in behavior back into mass media and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior another example very different this is a pro amateur or pro am media critic who has this high fan out rate so a lot of people are following this person very influential and they have a propensity to talk about what 's on tv so this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together sometimes it 's actually a piece of content that is special so if we go and look at president obama 's state of the union address from just a few weeks ago the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable a nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what 's on on the broadcast and of course through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language we pulse of a nation real time sense of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph being activated by content the idea is this as our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they 're saying it in and i think the implications here are profound and so just to return to my son and then i went on to reflect isn 't it amazing this going to hand off to you and to your sister who arrived two years later and you guys are going to be able to go back possibly remember the way you can now and he was quiet for a moment and i thought what am i thinking he 's five years old he 's not going to understand this and just as i was having that thought he looked up at me and said so that when i grow up i can show this to my kids i thought wow this is powerful stuff so i want to leave you with one last this is the first time our son took more than two steps at once and i really want you to focus on something as i take you through it 's natural life my mother 's in the kitchen cooking and of all places in the hallway i realize he 's about to do it about realizing what 's happening and then the magic happens listen very carefully about three steps in he realizes something magic is happening and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in and i echo back the same and so let 's fly back in time to that memorable moment"
