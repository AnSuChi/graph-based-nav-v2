  "transcript": "i 'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet and not in the traditional sense not just the gay closet i think we all have closets your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time or telling someone that you 're pregnant or telling someone you have cancer or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives all a closet is and although our topics may vary tremendously the experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal i was working at the south side walnut cafe and depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts and how recently i had shaved my head the question would often be sprung on me usually by a little kid are you a boy or are you a girl hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance and i would seethe inside and it got to the point where every time i walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere three and ten years old i was ready to fight so i promised myself the next time i would say something so within a matter of weeks it happens again and i am about to go all women 's studies one this table so i take a deep breath and i look down not a challenge to a feminist duel just a kid with a question are you a boy or are you a girl i know it 's kind of confusing my hair is short like a boy 's and i wear boy 's clothes but i 'm a girl and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies well i 'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl and this kid looks me dead in the eye without missing a beat and says my favorite pajamas are purple with fish can i get a pancake please and that was it just oh okay you 're a girl how about that pancake it was the easiest hard conversation i have ever had because pancake girl and i we were both real with each other so like many but inside in the dark you can 't tell what color the walls are so really my closet is no different than yours or yours sure i 'll give you one hundred reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours but here 's the thing hard is not relative hard is hard who can tell me that explaining to someone you 've just declared bankruptcy is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your five year old you 're getting a divorce there is no harder there is just hard we need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else 's hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just commiserate on the fact that we all have hard at some point in our lives but i am here to tell you no matter what your walls are made of a closet is no place for a person to live thanks so imagine yourself twenty years ago me i had a ponytail curled up in the corner of my and moving one muscle is the scariest thing i have ever my family my friends strangers i had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people and now i was turning the world upside down i was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long but if you do not throw that grenade it will kill you one of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister 's wedding so in doing my maid of honor duties in my black dress and heels i walked around to tables and finally landed on a table of my parents ' friends folks that had known me for years and after a little small talk one of the women shouted out i love nathan lane and the battle of gay he 's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend ash what 's your favorite tv show our favorite tv show favorite will & grace and you know who we love jack jack is our favorite and then one woman stumped but wanting so desperately to show her support to let me know she was on my side she finally blurted out well sometimes my husband wears pink shirts and i had a choice in that moment as all grenade throwers do i could go back to my girlfriend and my gay loving table chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct gay hoops i had brought with me or i could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one that starting and having that conversation it would have been easy to point out where they felt short it 's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were trying and what else if you 're going to be real with someone you gotta be ready for real in so and i follow what i like to call the three pancake girl principles now please view this through gay colored lenses but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same number one be authentic take the armor off be yourself that kid in the cafe had no armor but i was ready for battle number two be direct just say it rip the band aid off if you know you are gay just say it if you tell your parents you might be gay they will hold out hope that this will change do not give them that sense of false hope and most important be unapologetic you are speaking your truth never apologize for that some folks may be disappointed but that is on them not on you those are their expectations of who you are not yours that is their story not the only story that matters is the one that you want to write so the next time you find yourself in a pitch black closet clutching your grenade know and you may feel so very alone you are not because i guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live"
