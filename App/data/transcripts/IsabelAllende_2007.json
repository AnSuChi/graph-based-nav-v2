  "transcript": "there 's a jewish saying that i want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity all stories interest me and some haunt me until i end up writing them certain themes keep coming up magic but i have lived in anonymity until february of two thousand and six when i carried the olympic flag in the winter olympics in italy now people recognize me in macy 's and my grandchildren think that i 'm cool allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame called me and said that i had been selected to be one of the i replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because i 'm as far as you can get from being an athlete actually i wasn 't even sure that i could go around the stadium without a walker i was told that this was no laughing matter and three olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was i going to wear a she said i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak looking like the michelin man by the middle of february i found myself in turin where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the eighty olympic teams was in the street they all deserved to win but there 's the element of luck however what matters most more than training or luck is the heart only a fearless and determined heart the streets of turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the olympics passion lives here isn 't it always true heart is what drives us and determines our that is what i need for my characters in my books a passionate heart adventurers outsiders and rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters they only make and the actresses susan sarandon and sophia loren wangari maathai the nobel prizewinner from kenya who has planted thirty million trees and by doing so she and somaly mam a cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution when she was fourteen years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel and of brothels they are tortured with electricity but it was far from the michelin man suit that i had anticipated not bad really i looked like a refrigerator the universal symbol of beauty and passion slim and tall with a deep tan now how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles i don 't know when asked in a tv interview how could she look so good and i don 't make old people 's noises so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth no farting well she didn 't say that exactly and the loudspeakers announced the olympic flag and the music started by the way the same music that starts here the aida march sophia loren was right in front of me she 's a foot taller than i am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a so that my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photos i appear too although often between sophia 's legs place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium my husband is offended when i say this although i have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes i want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the olympics eighty percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed she names the twins after the camp 's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them and then sasha chanoff arizona where they 're now living and thriving the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like rose mapendo i don 't make them up i was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forced labor they have children that they don 't want or they cannot feed they have no control over their they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called a feminist is an insult but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and i have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved the name doesn 't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it the place is a small women 's clinic in a village in bangladesh the year is two thousand and five jenny is a young american dental hygienist and the clinic is just a hut full of flies a line of women who have waited several hours she 's not licensed for that she has never done it she risks a lot and she 's terrified but fortunately she has brought some novocaine she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation the next morning when she comes again to the so called clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman 's face looks the husband furious threatens to kill the american jenny is horrified at what she has done her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him they are paid less than men for the same work if they 're paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse benefits the society if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off wangari maathai goes to a village in kenya she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy twenty dollars are given to men 's programs women are fifty one percent of humankind empowering them will change everything more than technology and i can promise you that they are collateral damage men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking does it make sense to participate in the existing world order we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody not only for the privileged in january i saw an exhibit of fernando botero 's paintings berkeley library they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power in the voluminous botero style i have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart what i fear most the alpha males define reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules the rules change all the time but they always benefit them works perfectly abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom women and children especially the poor are at the bottom even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse a woman or a child i 'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender"
