  "transcript": "ever since i stumbled across a fairly obscure and he described the diversity within crops all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such as a and he said this genetic resource and i 'll never forget the words stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine so i looked a little and what i figured out was that he wasn 't a nutcase he was the most respected scientist in the field what he understood was that biological diversity crop diversity and he also understood literally crumbling that indeed a mass extinction was underway in our in our fields in our agricultural system and that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring you don 't see it in the newspaper every let me show you a picture of one form of diversity and imagine each one of these and i put thirty or forty of them on a slide it would take about ten slides because there about four hundred breeds of dogs in the world but there are thirty five to forty thousand different varieties but the interesting thing is that this diversity and the tragic thing is we have about two hundred thousand different varieties of wheat and we have about two to four hundred thousand and i want to give you an example of that it 's a bit of a personal example in fact in the united states in the hundred of those are extinct and at the end of the speech i would ask how many people have found a name and i said you know what these apples come from your ancestors and your ancestors gave them the good news is a third of you didn 't hold up your hand make sure it doesn 't join the list so i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple and there 's an old book back here and i want to read a piece from it and the fowler apple is described in here i hope this doesn 't surprise you as a beautiful fruit i don 't know if we named the apple us but but to be honest the description goes on and it says that it doesn 't rank high in quality however and then he has to go even further it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine as grown in new york the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and there are a couple of answers to that question one thing is that there is no such thing as a best one today 's best variety is tomorrow 's lunch for insects or pests or disease the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that 's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we 're going to need for climate change thank god that the fowler apple best apple in the world it 's just necessary or interesting that it might have one why as a raw material as a trait we can use in the future think of diversity as giving us options of course are exactly what we need in an era of climate change i want to show you two slides but first i want to tell you that we 've been working at the global crop diversity trust with a number of scientists particularly at stanford and university of washington to ask the question what 's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this in short the answer is that the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter hotter than the hottest of the past is agriculture adapted to that i don 't know can fish play the piano if agriculture hasn 't experienced that how could it be adapted and i want to show you the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures going back the tallest bar is the average temperature for the most the agricultural system and more importantly the crops in the field in india have never experienced this before here 's but the most interesting thing about south africa is we don 't have to wait for two thousand and seventy for there to be trouble by two thousand and thirty if the maize or corn varieties which is the dominant crop fifty percent of the nutrition in southern africa are still in the field in two thousand and thirty we 'll have a thirty percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in we will watch children starve to death on tv we have two rolls of the dice to get this right we have to get climate ready crops in the field and we have to do that rather quickly mostly in the form of seed and we put it in seed banks which is a fancy way of saying a freezer you dry it and then you freeze it unfortunately these seed banks in rwanda in the solomon islands and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures and all kinds of things it means extinction we lose diversity and i 'm not talking about losing diversity in in the same way that you lose your car keys i 'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs actually losing it never to be seen again so a number of us got together and decided that you know enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of maybe not the most charismatic diversity you don 't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do so we needed a really safe place and we went quite far north to find it to svalbard in fact this is above mainland norway you can see greenland there that 's it 's a remarkably beautiful landscape i can 't even begin to describe it to you it 's otherworldly beautiful we worked with the norwegian government and with the norgen the norwegian genetic resources program to design this facility what you see is an artist 's conception of this facility but it 's remote and accessible so it 's safe and we don 't depend on mechanical refrigeration this is more than just an artist 's dream and this next picture shows it in context in svalbard when you open up the front door chiseled in solid rock about one hundred and thirty meters there are now a couple of security doors so you won 't see it quite like this again and i know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd but some of the happiest days of my life have been spent you were to walk into into one of these rooms you would see this it 's not very exciting but if you know what 's there it 's pretty emotional we have now about four hundred and twenty five thousand samples of unique crop varieties there 's seventy thousand samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now about a year from now we 'll have over half a million samples we 're going up to over a million and someday we 'll basically have samples about five hundred seeds of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state this is a backup system for world agriculture it 's a backup system for all the seed banks it operates like a like a safety deposit box norway owns the mountain then they can come back and get it this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the united states of i think it 's interesting in that this facility i think is literally every country in the world because we have seeds from every country in the world sustainable i can 't think of anything else that 's happened in my lifetime that way i can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a solution for climate change for or world hunger or peace in conflict i can 't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that but i can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can 't solve any of those problems if we don 't have crop diversity because i challenge you to think of sustainable solution to climate change if we don 't have crop diversity because quite literally neither will we and if crops don 't adapt neither will we a very real sense but it 's not the complete answer we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer we need to catalog it it 's a library of life now i would say we don 't have a card catalog for it and we need to support it financially my big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat thirty million dollars in an endowment so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms and my final thought is that by conserving wheat rice potatoes and the other crops we may quite simply end up saving"
