  "transcript": "that is hidden from us at least in modern cultures it would be to reveal something that we 've forgotten that we used to know as well as we knew our own names and that is that we live in a competent universe that we are part of a brilliant planet and that we are surrounded biomimicry is a new discipline that tries to learn from those geniuses and take advice from them design advice that 's where i live and it 's my university as well i 'm surrounded by genius i cannot help but remember this is what happens this is what keeps its promise imagine that orchestration you think ted is hard to organize and if you haven 't done this in a while do imagine there is lots of there is lots of love in the air and the organisms i promise you have all of their priorities in order i have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this because he 's living usually on his back looking up and one time he came up to me he was about seven or eight years old he came up to me and there was a wasp 's nest that i had let grow in my yard right outside my door and most people knock them down when they 're small but it was fascinating to me because i was looking at this sort of fine italian end papers and he came up to me and he knocked he would come every day with something to show me and like knock like a woodpecker on my door until i opened it up and he asked me how i had made the house for those wasps and i could see why he but it occurred to me how in his small life had he already believed the myth that if something was that well done that we must have done it how did he not know it 's what we 've all forgotten that we 're not the first ones to build we 're not the first ones to process cellulose we 're not the first ones to make paper we 're not the first ones to try to optimize packing space or to waterproof or to try to heat and cool a structure we 're not the first ones to build houses for our young what 's happening now in this field called is that people are beginning to remember other organisms the rest of the natural world are doing things very similar to what we need to do but in fact they are doing them in a way that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet for billions so these people biomimics are nature 's apprentices and they 're focusing on function what i 'd like to do is show you a few of the things they have asked themselves what if every time i started to invent something i asked ' how would nature solve this ' this is a story about an engineer at j r west so the engineer 's boss said find a way to quiet this train he happened to be a birder and he thought to himself they go from one density of medium the air and he thought what if how does nature repel we 're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves turns out that it has no bacteria on its surface no fouling on its surface no barnacles it 's a slow moving shark so how does it keep its body free of bacteria build up it doesn 't do it with a chemical it does it it turns out with the same denticles that you had and that pattern the architecture of that pattern on its skin denticles there is a company called sharklet technologies that 's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals to keep bacteria from landing which is better than dousing anti bacterials or harsh cleansers that many many organisms are now becoming drug resistant hospital acquired infections are now killing more people every year in the united states than this is a little critter that 's in the namibian desert it has no fresh water and those bumps act like a magnet for water they have water loving tips and waxy sides there is actually a scientist here at oxford who studied this andrew parker ten times better than our fog catching nets now a cement manufacturing and they 're using co2 as a building block in cement in concrete instead of cement usually emits a ton of co2 for every ton of cement now it this is a new kind of solar cell that 's based on how a leaf works it can be put down on any substrate whatsoever it 's a company that i 'm involved in called onesun with paul hawken there are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt we take water and push it against a membrane and then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity nature does something much more every cell every red blood cell of your body right now has these they actually export water molecules through it 's kind of a forward osmosis they export water molecules through and leave solutes on the other side trees and bones are constantly reforming this algorithm has been put into a software program g m opel used it to create that that skeleton you see in what 's called their bionic unlike this chip bag here this beetle uses one material chitin it 's strong and resilient it 's breathable it creates color through structure whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things one of our major inventions that we need to be able to do to come even close to what these organisms can do is to find a way to minimize the amount of material the kind of material we use and to add design to it we use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see in our world we use about three hundred and fifty polymers to make all this nature is nano loose nanoparticles what is really interesting to me is that not many people have been asking how can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe always in fact sulfur reducing bacteria they will emit as a byproduct nanoparticles into the water but then right after that they emit a protein that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution and one of the largest fields right now in the world of energy grids you hear about the smart grid one of the largest consultants are the social insects swarm technology there is a company called regen they are looking at how ants and bees find their food and their flowers in the most effective way and they 're having appliances in your home talk to one another through that algorithm and determine how to minimize there 's a group of scientists in cornell that are making what they call a synthetic tree because they are saying there is no pump at the bottom of a tree it 's capillary action and transpiration pulls water up a drop at a time pulling it and they 're creating you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper they 're thinking about putting it on the insides some of these species create six hundred volts of electricity with the chemicals that are in your body even more interesting to me is that six hundred volts doesn 't fry it you know we use pvc and we we sheath wires with pvc for insulation these are some questions that we 've yet to ask here 's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale humpback whale has and those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by thirty two percent these wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow mit just has a new radio chip and it 's based on the cochlear of your ear able to pick up television signals and radio signals in the same chip finally on an ecosystem scale which is my consulting company we work with hok architects we 're looking at building whole cities in their in their planning department and what we 're saying is that shouldn 't our cities do at least as well in terms of ecosystem services as the native systems that they replace so we 're creating something called ecological performance standards that hold cities to this higher bar the question is biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate the question i would ask is what 's worth solving if you haven 't seen this it 's pretty amazing this is a depiction of all of the water on earth and inside those balls life over three point eight billion years has made a lush livable place and we are in a long long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves how can we live here gracefully over the long haul how can we do what life which is to create conditions conducive to life now in order to do we need a way to remind ourselves and to somehow meet them again and i would encourage you all to please go to it it 's called and what we 're trying to do in a tedesque and the scientists who are contributing to eol are answering a question what can we learn from this organism and that information will go into will be able in the moment of creation to type in how does nature and sea turtles and your own kidneys"
