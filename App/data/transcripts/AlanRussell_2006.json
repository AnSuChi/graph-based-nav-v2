  "transcript": "i 'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope there are words that we 're truly afraid of diabetes parkinson 's alzheimer 's heart failure lung failure things that we know and what i want to lay out for you today is why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if if you think it already hasn and we 're going to do all of that in eighteen minutes i promise i want to start with this slide because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it this was an issue from two thousand and two that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human it was basically a regenerative medicine issue regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand it 's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine this is not regenerative medicine regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago the idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like and i 'll come back to that theme a few times instead of doing that we will regenerate lost function of the body so that at the end of the treatment you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment and this is just the same if you look back in charles lindbergh who was better known for flying airplanes was actually one of the first people along with alexis carrel one of the nobel laureates from rockefeller to begin to think about could you culture organs and they published this book in where they actually began to think about what could you do in we 've come a long way since i 'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that 's going on but before doing that what i 'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe one of the challenges is is that the richer we are the longer we live this is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of sixty five and you can basically see that the richer a country is population is thirty if the average age in your country is forty five to fifty five now the average person is looking at diabetes early onset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease things that are inherently more difficult to treat and much more expensive to treat just have a look at the demographics in who were basically outside of being really sick paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease in two thousand and ten two workers per retiree in the u s and this is matched in every industrialized wealthy country and you can see that right around age forty five forty to forty five there 's a sudden spike in the cost of health care it 's actually quite interesting if you do the right studies and you can actually there are very few things very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging i they don 't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom think of it in terms of diabetes for instance insulin 's a pretty good therapy but eventually it stops working and diabetes leads to a predictable why couldn 't we just inject the pancreas with something and it might be a little bit we would truly be able to do something different if a newt can do this kind of thing why can 't we i 'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment but what we 're talking about in so today the message is we will treat your symptoms and you need to adjust to a new way of life i would pose to you that tomorrow but it 's within the foreseeable future we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation there 's a limb prosthetic up here similar actually one on the imagine if instead of facing that they could actually face the regeneration of that but it 's applicable again to every organ system how can we do that the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body we need to learn to speak the body 's language and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus a mammalian fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will re grow that limb dna has the capacity but it is lost as as we age in a child before the age of about six months if they lose their fingertip in an accident they 'll re grow their fingertip by the time they 're five they won 't be able to do so to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the body 's language and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today i 'm going to give you an example of three of these we heal ourselves in a natural process using cells to do most of the work they may do the healing design materials or extract materials from a natural environment then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself and finally we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active may contain all all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself and he asked a very important question he asked the question if i take that material which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine and i place it somewhere else on a person 's body i wouldn 't be telling you this story if it about to show you is a compelling picture however for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends the lights are down this is a good time to look at your feet check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen what i 'm about to show you and although it 's good to laugh before we look at this this is the reality of diabetes i think a lot of times we hear about diabetics diabetic ulcers we just don 't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment which is amputation if you can 't heal it so i 'm going to put the slide up now it won 't be up for long this is a and and that material induced the body just a few weeks after treatment this case taking that material turning it into a gel it would look great here 's a dolphin where the fin 's been re attached there are now four hundred thousand patients around the world darpa just gave steve fifteen million after treatment that 's what it looks like there are materials that do this here are the heart patches but could you go a little further could you say instead of using material can i take some cells along with the material this was done by teruo okano it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish you don 't want to watch but this one 's kind of cool this is a bypass operation just like what al gore had with a difference in this case at the end of the bypass operation you 're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient and i 'm standing up here because at one point i 'm going to show you just how early this technology is here go the stem cells right into the beating heart of the patient and if you look really carefully it 's going to be right around this point you 'll actually see a back flush you see the cells coming back out we need all sorts of new technology new devices to get the cells to the right place at the right time just a little bit of data a tiny bit of data this was a randomized trial at this time this was an n of twenty now there 's an n of about one hundred basically if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass they get a little bit better if you give them stem cells as well as their bypass for these particular patients they became asymptomatic these are now two years out this is the same procedure but now done minimally invasively with only three holes in the body where they 're taking but basically that works too you can take and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state here 's another example of stem cell therapy that isn 't quite clinical yet but i think very soon will be along with a number of colleagues around the world they 've decided that liposuction fluid which in the united states we have a lot of liposuction fluid it 's a great source of stem cells stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid so you could go in you could get your tummy tuck and in this case the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons and i think fairly soon you will see patients being treated with their i talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease here 's just one example before i close up this is equally tragic we have a very abiding and and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army who have to treat the now eleven thousand we and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take in this case here a new wearable bio reactor has been designed it should be tested clinically later this year at isr deliver other things as well at the same time and therefore we will seed that lawn as opposed to try the sodding approach it 's a completely different way of doing it and maybe a little the good news it 's very powerful work clearly the images kind of get that across it 's incredibly difficult because it 's highly inter disciplinary almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen a number of governments and a number of regions have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease the japanese government were perhaps the first when they decided to invest first three billion later another two billion in this field it 's no coincidence japan is the oldest country on earth in so they 're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this the same thing china just launched a national tissue engineering center the first year budget was two hundred and fifty million us dollars in the united states we 've had a somewhat different approach we 've had a different approach and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along but there 's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way"
