  "transcript": "planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life in this image of the tokyo skyline i 've hidden data from the newest planet hunting space telescope on the block the kepler mission can you see it this is just a tiny part of the sky the kepler stares at where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over one hundred and fifty thousand stars every half hour and very precisely and what we 're looking is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us in just over two years of operations we 've found over one thousand two hundred potential new planetary systems around other stars to give you some perspective the previous two decades of searching we had only known about four hundred prior to kepler when we see these little dips in the light we can determine a number of things for one thing we can determine that there 's a planet there but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star that distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall and that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it 's a little like you or i sitting around a campfire this is our star this is our sun it 's shown here in visible light that 's the light that you can see with your own but you 'll notice something else and that 's that the face of the sun has freckles and we can measure this very very precisely with kepler and trace their effects these are just the tip of the iceberg we had uv eyes or x ray eyes we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our sun 's magnetic activity the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well just think even when it 's cloudy outside these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time so when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable whether it might be amenable to life to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is but we want to know about its space weather and so we can 't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system i 'm showing here but what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe kepler won 't find a planet around but really every measurement it makes is precious because it 's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets"
