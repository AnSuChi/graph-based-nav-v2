  "transcript": "i joined a few months after september eleven feeling like i think most people in the country did at the time filled with a sense of patriotism and retribution and the desire to do something that coupled with that fact that i wasn 't doing anything i was seventeen just graduated from high school that past summer living in the back room of my parents ' house paying rent i can spell that later for people who are interested mishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays i did in high school and may she rest in peace i was serious enough about acting that i auditioned for juilliard when i was a senior in high school i also did that hail mary la acting odyssey that i always heard stories about of actors moving to la with like seven dollars and finding work and successful careers i got as far as amarillo texas finally made it to santa monica not even la stayed for forty eight hours wandering the beach basically got in my car drove home thus ending my acting career so cutting grass at the local 4 h fairgrounds this was my world going into september two thousand and one so after the 11th and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty and just being pissed off in general at myself my parents the government not having confidence not having a respectable job my shitty mini fridge that i just drove to california and back which was the people these weird dudes a motley crew of characters from a cross section of the united states that on the surface i had nothing in common with and over time and for me the marine corps became synonymous with my friends and then a few years into my service and months away from those never in the military may find this hard to understand but being told i wasn 't getting deployed to iraq or afghanistan was very devastating for me i have and then suddenly i was a civilian i knew i wanted to give acting another shot because someone should turn on the air conditioner this coffee line is too long i was a marine i knew how to survive i 'd go to new york and become an actor if things didn 't work out i 'd live in central park and dumpster dive behind and i was relatively healthy i can 't imagine going through that process on top of a mental or physical injury but regardless it was difficult throwing imaginary balls of energy at the back of the room doing acting exercises where i gave birth to myself my friends were serving without me overseas and i was an infantry marine where you 're shooting machine guns and firing mortars there 's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world laughter i struggled to find meaning you can 't smoke in the field because you don 't want to give away your position you don 't touch your face you have to maintain a personal level of health and hygiene you face this way when colors plays out of respect for people who went before you walk this way talk this way because of this your history and the respect you had earned in the civilian world there 's no rank and the respect civilians were giving me while i was in uniform didn 't exist when i was out of it there didn 't seem to be a how often in the civilian world life or death situation with with your closest friends they constantly demonstrate that they 're not going to abandon you and meanwhile at acting school discovering playwrights and characters and plays that had nothing to do with the military but were somehow and i felt myself becoming less aggressive as i was able to put words to feelings for the first time and realizing what a valuable tool that was and when i was reflecting on my time in the military i wasn 't first thinking on the stereotypical drills and discipline and pain of it but rather the small intimate grieving together celebrating together all within the backdrop of the military i saw my friends battling these circumstances and i watched the anxiety it produced in them and me not being able to express our feelings about it the military and theater communities are actually very similar you have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission greater than themselves it 's not about you you have a role you have to know your role within that team every team has a leader or director sometimes they 're smart sometimes they 're not you 're forced to be intimate with with complete strangers in a short amount of time the self maintenance i thought how great would it be to create a space that combined these two seemingly dissimilar communities that brought entertainment to a group of people that considering their occupation could handle something a bit more thought provoking than the typical mandatory fun events that i remember being volun told to go to in the military laughter all well intended but slightly which was a chaperoned walk around the parade deck with this pregnant cheerleader so we started this nonprofit called arts in the armed forces where we tried to do that tried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities we pick a play or select monologues from contemporary american plays that are diverse in age and race like a military audience is keep production value as minimal as possible no sets no costumes no lights just reading it to throw all the emphasis on the language and to show that theater can be created at any setting it 's a powerful thing getting in a room with strangers and reminding that prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms you can get lost in the sauce when it comes to explaining a collective experience and i can think of no better community to arm with a new means of than those protecting our country we 've gone all over the united states and the world from walter reed in bethesda maryland to camp pendleton to camp arifjan in kuwait to usag bavaria on and off broadway theaters in new york and for the performing artists we bring it 's a window into a culture they otherwise would not have had exposure to and for the military it 's the exact same and in doing this for the past six years i 'm always reminded that acting is many things it 's a craft it 's a political act it 's a business again there 's not many things better than that thank you we 're going to be doing a piece from marco ramirez called i am not batman jesse perez and matt johnson jesse perez it 's the middle of the night and the sky is glowing like and if you squint you can maybe see the moon through a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust that covers the whole city like a mosquito net that won 't let the angels in and if you look up high enough you can see me standing on the edge of building and up there a place for gargoyles and broken clock towers that have stayed still and dead for maybe like one hundred years up there and i gots and all it takes is a broom closet or a back room or a fire escape and danny 's hand me down jeans are gone and my navy blue polo shirt the one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt from when it got fence behind arturo 's but it isn 't even a big deal because i tuck that part in and it 's like all good that blue polo shirt transformational and nobody pulls out a belt and whips batman for talkin ' back or for not talkin ' back and nobody calls batman simple or stupid and nobody fires batman 's brother from the eastern taxi company ' cause they was making cutbacks neither they got nothing but respect and not like nobody 's afraid of you ' cause batman doesn 't mean nobody no harm ever ' cause all batman really wants to do is save people and maybe pay abuela 's bills one day and die happy and maybe get like and my cape is flapping in the wind cause it 's frickin ' long and my pointy ears are on and that mask that covers like half my face is on too and i got like bulletproof stuff all in my chest so somewhere in the city there 's a old lady picking styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can and she 's putting a piece of sesame chicken someone spit out into her own mouth and somewhere there 's a doctor with a wack haircut in a black lab coat trying to find a cure for the diseases that are gonna make us all extinct for real one day and somewhere there 's a 40 ounce bottles of twist off beer and the other half on a four hour visit to some lady 's house on a street where the lights have all been shot out by people who 'd rather do what they do in this city in the dark and if they don 't find a cent on him which they won 't they 'll just pound at him till the muscles in their arms start burning till there 's no more teeth to crack out grocery store brand macaroni and cheese and cut up vienna sausages ' cause they 'd rather believe i don so i swoop down like mad fast and i 'm like darkness hear what there ain 't nothing no really there ain 't no bat but then one out of the three good for nothings gets it to the head and number two swings blindly into the dark cape before him but before his fist hits anything i grab a trash can lid and but i know judo karate too so i 'm like twice but before i can do any more damage suddenly we all hear a click click like he 's holding jesus hostage like he 's threatening maybe to blow a hole in the moon and the good for nothing who got it to the head who tried to jump kick me and the other good for nothing who got it in the gut is both scrambling back away from the dark figure before ' em praying to saint anthony ' cause that 's the only one he could remember eyes glowing white cape blowing softly in the wind my heart beating right through it in a morse code for fuck with me just once come on just try and he aims it right between my pointy ears like goal posts and he 's special teams maybe i 'm gonna lose but for just a second my and i hold this thing for i could speak to the good for nothing in a language he maybe understands and i pick him up and i pull him to my face and he 's taller than me but the cape helps so he listens when i look him straight in the eyes and i say two words to him and he puts the glass back mad slow which he never does and i act like i 'm just waking up and i say ah what 's up pop and janitor man says nothing to me but i see in the dark see his arms go limp and his head turns back like towards me and he lifts it for i can see his face for i could see his eyes and his cheeks is drippin ' but not with sweat like he remembers he 's my pop and for a long time i don 't say nothin ' but i hear him mumble two words to me i 'm sorry and i lean over and i open my window just a crack if you look up high enough you could see me and from where i am"
