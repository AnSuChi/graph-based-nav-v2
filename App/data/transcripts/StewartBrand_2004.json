  "transcript": "welcome to ten thousand feet let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you once upon a time i did a book called how buildings learn today 's event you might call how for ten years i 've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare or in some cases non existent it would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter but you next ten thousand years so we have the long now foundation in san francisco it 's an incubator for about a dozen projects all having to do with continuity over the long term our core project is a rather ambitious folly i suppose a mythic undertaking to build keep good time for for that long a period and the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious go to the clock and what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago it 's the first working prototype of the clock it 's about nine feet high designed by danny hillis and alexander rose so the design problem for today is going to be how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick save time beautifully for one hundred centuries well this was the first solution and it looked like a way to go until you start thinking about what does deep time do to a building well this is what deep time does to a building this is the parthenon it 's only two thousand four and now it 's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for that 's what happens to buildings they 're vulnerable even the most durable and intactable buildings like the pyramids of giza are in bad shape when you look up close they 've been looted inside and out and they 're built to protect things but they don 't protect things how about underground with a view underground in a place that 's really solid so the obvious answer was you need absolutely the right mountain and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest we looked at mesas in new mexico led us to eastern nevada to america 's newest and oldest national park which is called great basin national park it 's right on the eastern border of nevada it 's the highest range in the state over thirteen thousand feet and you 'll notice that on the left on the it 's very steep and on the right it 's gentle and it 's inside the green line is national forest and then over to the left is bureau of land management land and some private land now as it happened that two mile long strip right in the middle this vertical was available because it was private land and thanks to jay walker who was here and mitch kapor who was here who started the process long now was able to get that two mile long strip of land look at the grand truth of what 's there we 're in pole canyon looking west which is eleven thousand six hundred feet on top and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock it would be a pilgrimage to get to it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is so last june the long now board some staff and some donors and and advisors made a two week expedition to the mountain and two if it 's the right mountain might actually work for us now danny hillis sort of framed the problem he has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work it 's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure it starts with the image then there 's the point of embarkation that is the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest then this is a nice image of it there 's the labyrinth the labyrinth is a concept it 's like a twilight zone it 's a place where it 's difficult where you get disoriented maybe you get scared then there should always be in sight the draw a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to to finish the process now brian eno who 's been in the thick of the long now process spent two years making a january seven thousand and three and it 's bell studies for the clock of the long now so that a peal of ten bells makes a different peal every day for ten thousand years the hillis algorithm ten factorial gives you that number and in january seven thousand and three there it is ok back to danny 's list this is it the climax the goal the main thing that you 're trying to get to and then danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff something you didn 't expect then there 's the return you 've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world so you have time to assimilate what you 've learned number seven at the end of it there 's something physical a kind of reward that you take away it might be a piece of a core drill how do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we 're talking about this is not a normal building project what do you look for what are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions start with borders if you look on the left side of the cliffs here that 's national park that 's sacrosanct you can 't do anything with that to the right of it is national forest there 's possibilities the borders are important were weather approaches and elevation and especially trees look at those things up on top there it turns out that mount washington is covered with bristlecone pines they 're the world 's oldest living thing people think they 're just the size of shrubs but that there are trees on that mountain that are five thousand years old and still living some of them go back ten thousand years the stone itself is absolutely beautiful sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there we had tree ring analysts from the university of arizona join us on the expedition now 's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it especially on the end that 's interesting you 'll find out why it 's called a bristlecone little sensory experience here 's danny hillis in the midst of a led by a theory edmund schulman in had been studying trees under great stress at timberline and came to the realization that he put in an article in science magazine called longevity under adversity in conifers and then based on that principle he started looking around at the various trees at timberline longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right ok onto the mines the first asking price for the property when we looked at it was one billion dollars for one hundred and eighty acres and a couple of mines because the owner said there 's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain and we said wow that 's great listen we 'll counter how about zero and we 're a non profit foundation you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction all you have to do is prove to the government years went by and there was some kind of back and forth and by and by thanks to mitch and jay we were able to buy the whole property for one hundred and forty thousand dollars this is one of the mines it doesn 't have any beryllium in it it 's called the pole adit but it a straight line due east into the range into very interesting territory except that as you 'll see when we go inside in a minute we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale and shale is not quite completely competent rock competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring the shale would like some shoring and so parts of it are caved in in there that 's ben roberts from he 's the bat specialist from the national park there are many wonders back in there like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers ok here 's another mine that 's up on top of the property and it dates back to one thousand eight hundred and seventy that 's what the property was originally built around it was a set of mining claims it was a very productive silver mine in fact it was you may recognize a couple of the miners there there 's jeff bezos on the right and paul saville on the left which is the lead silver thing they didn 't find any they both kept their day jobs here 's the last 's called the bonanza adit it 's down in a canyon and alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey the whole mine it 's a mile deep and they also found four species of bats in there but it 's something to think about they don 't quite meet let 's go to weather way more interesting than monterey even today there we were woke up in the morning the mountain was covered with snow that was a great time to go up and visit our and this is on the left there the joyful lady is pat irwin and we want a temporary use permit for the clock eventually 10 000 year temporary use permit and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in bozeman and there you see a week of weather at nine thousand four hundred feet on let 's go to approaches as it happens there are no trails anywhere on mount washington just a few old mining roads like this so you have to bushwhack everywhere and there 's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time you can hike for days and not encounter anybody well here 's a potential approach you need to come up the lincoln canyon it 's this beautiful world all of its own surrounded by cliffs and it 's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom and and from where you 're standing at six thousand feet in the valley it 's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at seven thousand six hundred feet and you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at ten thousand five hundred feet where there 's a bit of a problem check so alexander rose wanted to and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck as you gain elevation your iq goes danny hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can 't do in his head now i happened to be on the radio with alexander when he got to to this point at the base of the cliffs and he said i think i can get up a ways i know he 's going to love cliffs i 'm saying be careful be careful be careful then he starts going up and the next thing i hear is i it 's like climbing stairs i 'm going up sixty degrees it 's a secret the next thing i hear is i 've made it to the top you can see all of creation from up here and he dashed across the top of the mountains there he is that 's alexander rose first ascent of the western face to mount washington and a solo ascent at that we realized that we had to name this thing that alexander discovered how about zander 's crevice no so we finally decided on alexander 's siq zander 's siq is named after some of you have been to petra there 's this wonderful and it really is hidden i can 't find it in this image and i 'm not sure you can when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there and that brings it out now danny and i were up at this same area one day and danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view do i have to do that you can get another angle on on danny 's porch by going around to the south and looking north and and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate so even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on the clock will keep this is all and if you go up there and look back that 's eighty miles to the horizon and that 's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs that 's it 's eleven thousand four hundred feet and it 's exquisite go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs it 's six hundred foot just about a yard to the left of kurt bollacker 's foot there is a 600 foot drop he 's ambling on over to zander 's siq that 's what it looks like we should probably put in a rail or something over on the eastern side it 's gentle as you can see and that 's not snow that 's what the white limestone looks like you also see there a a bighorn sheep their herd was reintroduced from this is danny hillis and he 's figuring out a design problem he 's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley this is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak and that might be conjured with we gradually realized we have three serious design which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind danny and if you look off to the right fifteen miles across to the schell creek range there are ten ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains in fact there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch and i 'll and most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going this is their view to the west of the schell creek range and if you go out to that line of trees at the far end you 'll see what the valley used to look like this is rocky mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years because those ten ranches with their seventeen thousand acres dominate a five hundred square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on and there 's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and it would double the size of great basin national park that would be swell ok let 's take one more look at the mountain but from the outside it should be invisible now at the base of the high cliffs but what if it were deepened from inside you excavated from somewhere came up from inside and deepened it and this stone takes a perfect polish polish you 'd have a a polished set of passages and and chambers in there eventually leading to the ten thousand year clock and and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from but by what you very carefully take away so that 's what the mountain taught us most of the amazingness of the clock all we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them it 's not a clock in a mountain it 's a mountain clock indians in the southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything they say"
