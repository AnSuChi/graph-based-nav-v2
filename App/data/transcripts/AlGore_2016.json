  "transcript": "and then i found out i 'm leading off the nightmare section of it laughter and certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify and i have some bad news but i have a lot more good news i 'm going to propose three questions so the first the among other things changed the environmental movement really launched the modern environmental movement eighteen months after this earthrise picture was first seen on earth the first earth day was organized and we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space and one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists have long told us one of the most essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky as this picture illustrates the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground it is a very thin shell that right now is the open sewer for our industrial we are spewing one hundred and ten million tons of heat trapping global and there are many sources of the greenhouse gases i 'm certainly not going to go through them all i 'm going to focus on the main one but agriculture is involved diet is involved population is involved management but i 'm going to focus on the heart of the problem which is the fact that we still rely on dirty carbon based fuels for eighty five percent of all the energy that our world burns every year and you can see from this accumulated amount of man made global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by four hundred thousand atomic bombs exploding every twenty four hours three hundred and sixty five days a year it 's the truth now it 's a big planet but that is a lot of energy particularly when you multiply it four hundred thousand times per day this is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal but the entire curve has moved to the right in the 'll see in the lower right hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days in the 90s the curve shifted further and in the last ten years you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days in fact they are one hundred and fifty times more common so we 're having record breaking temperatures fourteen of the fifteen of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century the but for the first time it was more than two degrees fahrenheit warmer than the average these higher temperatures are having an effect on animals plants people ecosystems but on a global basis and the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths deep mid ocean the first few hundred this has consequences get stronger super typhoon haiyan went over areas of the pacific five and a half degrees fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into tacloban as the most destructive visited tacloban right after that superstorm sandy went over areas of the atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into new york and new the second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now the warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent and it creates these atmospheric rivers the brazilian scientists call them flying and they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive downpours this is from montana these downpours are really unusual paralyzed these record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides this one is from chile last year and you 'll see that warehouse going by there are oil tankers cars going by this is from spain last september you could call this the running of the cars and trucks i guess every night on the tv news now is like a nature hike through the book of revelation i mean really and the causality requires a moment as the great kevin trenberth says all storms are different now there 's so much extra energy in the atmosphere there 's so much extra water vapor every storm is the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper longer more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right there 's certainly been evidence of that a lot of them more lightning as the heat energy builds up there 's also have geopolitical consequences and create instability the climate related historic drought that started in syria in two thousand and six and drove one point five million climate refugees into the cities of syria where they collided with another one refugees from the iraq war and along with other factors that opened the gates of hell that people are trying to close now the us defense department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis including refugees food and water shortages and right now we 're seeing but the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can can become endemic and change the range of the the vectors like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them the zika too cool the lancet one of the two greatest medical journals in the world last summer labeled this a medical emergency now and there are many factors because of it this is also connected to the extinction crisis we 're in danger of losing fifty percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century and already land based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of fifteen feet speaking of the north pole last december twenty nine the same storm that caused historic flooding in the american midwest dark winter polar night paul nicklen 's beautiful photograph from svalbard illustrates this it 's more dangerous coming off greenland and particularly antarctica number one is miami three and a half trillion dollars at risk number three new york and newark i was in miami last fall during the supermoon one not with rain they call it sunny day flooding it comes up through the storm sewers this is a crisis that 's getting worse day by day we have to move beyond partisanship and i want to take a moment to honor these house republicans applause who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk so the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up there are many of these aspects i haven 't even mentioned it 's an enormous burden i 'll mention just one more because the world economic forum last month in davos after their annual survey of seven hundred and fifty economists said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy so you get central bankers like mark carney the head of the uk central bank saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are if you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books twenty eight trillion dollars so the rest twenty two trillion dollars risk to the global economy that 's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative so the answer to the first question second question can we change we see an exponential curve for wind installations now we see the cost coming down dramatically some countries take germany an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from vancouver 's by the way one day last december got eighty one percent of all its energy from renewable resources mainly solar and wind a lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis more good news energy storage from batteries particularly is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem with solar the news is even more exciting we beat that mark by seventeen the exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic when i came to this stage ten years ago this is where it was we have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves and the cost has come down ten percent per year for thirty years and it 's continuing because it 's crossing the grid parity point cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise grid parity is understood as that line that threshold below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels degrees fahrenheit or zero and one celsius it 's a difference of more than one degree it 's the difference between ice and water and it 's the difference between markets this is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world and two thirds of it is in the private sector we are seeing an explosion of new investment starting in two thousand and ten investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils the gap has been growing ever since the projections for the future are even more dramatic even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate forty times larger than renewables and by the way if you add the projections for nuclear on here particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break there are many but let 's look at cell phones in one thousand nine hundred and then ma bell commissioned mckinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then how many can we sell by and for the balance of the year they sold one hundred and twenty times more and now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world so and i think the answer is in three parts first the cost came down much faster than anybody expected even as the quality went up and low income countries places that did not have a landline grid well not so hot and in many solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable muhammad yunus financed this one in bangladesh enough energy from the sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world 's energy needs for an entire year it 's actually a little bit less than an hour so the answer to the second question they 're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system they will likely link up with the european union the united states has already been changing all of these coal plants were proposed in the next ten years and canceled all of these existing coal plants were retired of these coal plants have had their retirement announced all of them almost three quarters was from renewable energy mostly wind and solar we are solving this the only question is how long will it take to get there so it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change almost four hundred thousand people marched in new york city before and so this i 'll finish with this story when i was thirteen years old i heard that proposal by president kennedy to land a person on the moon and bring him back safely in ten years may well fail but eight years and two months later in the moment that neil armstrong set foot on the moon here 's a little known fact about that the average age of the systems engineers the controllers in the room that day was which means among other things their age when they heard that challenge was eighteen we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced wrote a line that has stayed with me after the final ' no ' there comes a ' yes ' and on that ' yes ' the future world depends the civil rights movement the against apartheid and more recently the movement for gay and lesbian rights here in the united states and elsewhere after the final no comes a yes when any great moral challenge fore ordained because of who we are as human beings but i say thank you very much and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language no one else can do that that 's why you led this thing it was amazing to see it ten years ago it was amazing to see it now really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until i can get can get it into simple enough language that i can understand it and that 's the key to trying to communicate know that all those graphs all that progress is enough ag i think that the crossing you know i 've only been in the business world for fifteen years but one of the things i 've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent or cheaper than turns out it makes a difference if it 's cheaper than we are regularly surprised by these developments the late rudi dornbusch the great economist said things take longer to happen then you think they will and then they happen much faster than you thought they could i really think that 's where we are some people are using the phrase when it gets below the grid parity unsubsidized in most places then it 's the default choice now and i just don 't think it 's going to work they enlisted her in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations and she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn 't understand the request and so she went and and formed an alliance with the sierra club and they formed a new organization called the green tea party laughter and they defeated the proposal the answer to your question is this sounds a little corny and maybe it 's a clich but ten years ago and christiana referred to this there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating but it kick started this global revolution and what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we that the partisan thing changes backed that 's really exciting thank you so much"
