  "transcript": "such as the classic maya in the yucatan but there were also plenty java so evidently societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas how can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies such as somalia and rwanda and the former are also societies today that what about ourselves what is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have if anyone in analyzing societal collapses i 've arrived at a five point framework by the extinction of the greenland norse society this is a european in ad nine hundred and eighty four vikings went out to greenland settled greenland and around why did they all end up dead people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend and in the case of the viking norse the vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation which was a particular problem for them because so they ended up an iron age european society virtually unable to make their own iron item on my checklist is climate change climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter in the case of the vikings in greenland the climate got colder in the late 1300s and especially in the 1400s but a cold climate isn 't necessarily fatal because the inuit the eskimos inhabiting greenland at the same time did better rather than worse with cold climates so why the third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society and if that friendly support is pulled away that may make a society more likely to collapse in the case of the greenland norse they had trade with the mother country norway and that the fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies in the case of norse greenland the hostiles were the inuit the eskimos sharing greenland with whom the norse got off to bad relationships and we know that the inuit economic social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems in the case of the greenland norse cultural factors that made it difficult their being a so that 's how the five part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the greenland norse what about a society today for the past five years i 've been taking my wife and kids and montana at first sight seems like the most pristine and montana suffers from serious problems toxic problems from mine waste cost montana nearly two hundred million dollars a year montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization problems of forest management problems of forest fires second item on my checklist climate but montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack and as the snow is melting for example as the glaciers in glacier national park are disappearing that 's bad news for montana irrigation agriculture investments and so on which makes montana vulnerable to the rest of the united states fourth relations with montanans have the same problems as do all americans in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil last item on my checklist question of how political economic social cultural attitudes play into this montanans have long held values which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems long held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture and to no government regulation values that worked well in the past but they don 't seem to be working well today but nevertheless there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that one interesting common thread has to do with in many cases the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak but they build up get richer and more powerful and then within a short time within a few decades after their peak they collapse for example the classic classic lowland maya of the yucatan and maya population was would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish say they double every generation and five generations before the end the petri dish is fifteen and then the next generation 's three 4ths empty and the next generation half empty within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty what it means to put it mathematically is that if you 're concerned about a society today you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function the wealth itself but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function that 's one general theme a second general theme many of those factors are not well understood for example it turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors some rather subtle ones that were working against the easter islanders and they involve fallout of perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central asia but that 's a factor that we didn 't even appreciate until and then finally another generalization i 'm now teaching a course undergraduates on these collapses of societies what really bugs my ucla undergraduate students is how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing what did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree didn 't they see what they were doing how could societies not perceive and i would expect that if our human human civilization carries on then maybe in the next century why on earth did these people today in the year two thousand and three not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action it seems incredible and so i 've been trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems why they fail to perceive the problems or if they perceive them why they fail to tackle them or if they tackle them why do they fail to succeed in solving them i 'll just mention two generalizations in this area making collapse likely is where there is a conflict of interest between the short term interest of the decision making elites especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions where what 's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole there 's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run forcing tenant farmers into but led to the society 's collapse in the long run those same issues especially because the decision makers in the united states are frequently able to insulate themselves from consequences by living in gated compounds by drinking bottled water and so on and within the last couple of years such as draining a few billion dollars out of enron and other businesses they are quite correct that these things are good for them in the short term so that 's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions conflicts of interest and the other generalization that i want to mention is that it 's particularly hard for a society to make quote unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances for example the greenland norse in this difficult environment were held together for four and a half centuries by their but those two things commitment to religion and strong social cohesion also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the one of the things that enabled australia to survive in this remote outpost of european civilization for two hundred and fifty years has been their british identity so it 's particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength well all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world time bombs that have fuses and any one of which can do us in the time bombs of water of soil the photosynthetic ceiling population problems toxics etc etc listing about twelve of them and while these time bombs none of them has a fuse beyond fifty years and most of them have fuses of a few decades some of them in some places have much shorter fuses at the rate at which we 're going the philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years and the solomon islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest which is their major export and that 's going to be spectacular for the economy of the solomons people often ask me jared what 's the most important thing that we need to do about the world 's environmental problems and my answer is the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do instead there are a dozen things for example if we solve our problems of water and soil and population but don 't solve our problems of toxics then we are in trouble which means by definition that it cannot be maintained and the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades that means that those of us in this room who are less than fifty or sixty years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved and those of us who are over the age of sixty may not see the resolution but our children and grandchildren certainly will the resolution is going to achieve either of two forms either we will resolve these in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial remedial action but what 's for sure is does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed i draw the reverse conclusion"
