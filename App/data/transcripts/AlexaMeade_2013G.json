  "transcript": "i painted it directly on top of the man physically on you that also means you 're probably going to end up with an earful of paint gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what 's directly below it and in this way i 'm able to take a three dimensional scene and it will still look 2d there 's no photoshop here this is just a photo of one of my three dimensional paintings you but originally this had nothing do with either people or paint it was about shadows and it would be almost invisible until the light changed i made sure to follow that very i had turned my friend into a painting i couldn 't have foreseen that when i wanted to paint a shadow i would pull out this whole other that i would collapse it that i would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting and i 'd always had this dream of going to washington d c and sitting at why did this have to get in the way of all that i made the tough decision of going home after graduation but going down to my parents ' basement i was sixteen years old at summer camp and i didn 't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and because that 's not what this project was about for me it was about space and light it 's nearly impossible impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg it just and if i wanted to paint on i was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that i spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast it just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself one of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn 't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his i was having so much fun with this process i was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles and i wanted to see what else i could do with it and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface and i began painting because i could have a very specific image about how it would turn out i could paint it to match that but the moment that sheila laid back into the milk everything would change it was in constant flux but our solution would be okay hide your and when we started out on the milk and when i started out i couldn 't have foreseen that i would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow but then again i guess it 's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar as long as you 're willing to look beyond what 's already been brought to light that you can see what 's below the surface hiding in the shadows thank you"
