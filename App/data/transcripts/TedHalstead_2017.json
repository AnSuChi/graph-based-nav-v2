  "transcript": "daughter named naya who is under the mistaken impression that this conference is named in honor of her father who am i to contradict my baby girl it was the birth of my daughter that inspired me to launch this climate organization in order to counteract the excessive polarization of this issue in the united states know what it may even be better let me try to prove that to you what we really need is a killer app to climate policy in the technology world a killer app is an application so transformative that it creates its own market like uber in the climate world a killer app is a new solution so promising that it can break through the seemingly insurmountable barriers to progress these include the psychological barrier climate advocates have long been encouraging their fellow citizens to make short term sacrifices now for benefits that accrue to other people in other countries thirty or forty years in the future it just doesn 't fly because it runs contrary to basic human nature under the current rules of global trade countries have a strong incentive to free ride off the emissions reductions including we have the partisan barrier canada are nowhere near reducing emissions at the required scale and speed why we need a killer app of climate policy to break through each of these barriers i 'm convinced that the road to climate progress in the united states runs through the republican party and the business community so in launching the climate leadership council i started by reaching out to a who 's who of republican elder statesmen and james baker and george schultz the two most respected republican elder statesmen in america the two most respected conservative economists in the country together we co authored the conservative case for carbon dividends this this represents the first time that republican leaders put forth a concrete climate solution thank you we presented our plan at the white house two weeks after president trump moved in almost every leading editorial board in the country has since endorsed our plan fortune one hundred companies from a wide range of industries are now getting behind it our carbon dividends solution is based on four pillars the first like many operating systems it by far the largest is that market prices fail to take social and environmental costs into account that means every market transaction is based on incorrect information is to blame for our climate predicament this should be an easy problem to fix otherwise known as a carbon tax this would however a carbon tax by itself has proven to be unpopular and a political dead end this would transform an unpopular carbon tax into a popular and populist solution and it would also solve the underlying psychological barrier that we discussed by giving everyone a concrete benefit in the here and now assuming a carbon tax rate that starts at forty dollars per ton a family of four would receive two thousand dollars per year from the get go the bottom seventy percent of americans would receive more in dividends than they would pay in increased and that and could fundamentally alter climate politics but there 's another revolutionary element here the amount of the dividend the more we the more our citizens benefit this creates a positive feedback loop which is crucial because the only way we will reach our the third pillar of our program is eliminating regulations that are no longer so why should we trade let me show you our plan would achieve nearly twice the emissions reductions of all and nearly three times the new baseline after president trump repeals all of those regulations that assumes a carbon tax starting at forty dollars per ton which translates into roughly an extra thirty six cents per gallon per gallon of gas our plan by itself would meet the high end of america 's commitment under the paris climate agreement and as you can see the emissions this illustrates the power of a conservative climate solution based on free markets and limited government we would end up with while helping working class americans get ahead doesn 't that sound like something we could all support the fourth and final pillar of our program is a new climate which is ultimately what we need suppose country a adopts a carbon dividends plan and country b does not well to level the playing field and protect the competitiveness of its industries country a would tax imports from country b based on their carbon content because the money raised at the border would increase the dividends going to the citizens of country a well how long do you think it would take the public in and to push for a carbon dividends plan in their own land follow suit one by one the dominoes fall in germany or another european country or even in china let 's take china as an example china is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions but what its leaders care even more about is transitioning their economy to consumer led economic development well nothing could do more to hasten that transition than giving every chinese this is the only policy solution that would enable china to meet its environmental and economic goals at the same the partisan barrier and as we 've just seen the geopolitical barrier wanted country to pioneer carbon dividends plan cost to country zero additional compensation gratitude of i 've seen a conservative get a standing o at ted before that that 's pretty cool the logic seems really powerful but some people you talk to in politics say it 's hard to imagine this still getting through congress how are you feeling about momentum behind this ted halstead so far it 's been a the pressure is going to mount for a replacement program which is where we come in and there are three reasons why which i 'll go through real quickly one the business community is fundamentally within two months we 're going to be announcing some really surprising names coming out in favor of this and three well let 's pan it out both ways if it stays in paris as many are pushing for in the administration well then that begs a question what the international pressure will be overwhelming our secretary of state will be asking other countries for nato contributions and they 'll be saying no give us our paris commitment come through on your commitments we 'll come through on ours so international business and even the republican base will all be calling for a republican replacement plan and hopefully we 've provided one"
