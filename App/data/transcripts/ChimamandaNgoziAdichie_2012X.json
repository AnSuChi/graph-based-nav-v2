  "transcript": "so i would like to start okoloma maduewesi okoloma died in the notorious sosoliso plane crash okoloma was a person i could argue with laugh with and truly talk to he was also the first person to call me a feminist i was about fourteen we were at his house arguing both of us bristling with half bit knowledge from books that we had read but i remember that as i argued and argued okoloma looked at me and said you know you 're a feminist it was not a compliment i could tell from his tone the same tone that you would use to say something like you 're a supporter of terrorism i did not know exactly what this word and i did not want okoloma to know that i did not know so i brushed it aside and i continued to argue and the first thing i planned to do when i got home was to look up the word feminist in the dictionary now fast forward to i wrote a novel about a man who among other things beats his wife and whose story doesn 't end very well while i was promoting the novel in nigeria a journalist told me he wanted to advise me and for the nigerians here i 'm sure we 're all familiar with how quick our people are to give unsolicited advice he told me that people were saying that my novel was feminist and his advice to me and he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke was that i should never call myself a feminist because feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands so i decided to call myself a happy feminist then an academic a nigerian woman told me that feminism was not our culture and that feminism and that i was calling myself a feminist because i had been corrupted by western books which amused me because a lot of my early readings were decidedly unfeminist i think i must have read every single mills & boon romance published before i was sixteen and i really struggled to finish them but anyway since feminism was un african i decided that i would now call myself a happy african feminist at some point i was a happy african feminist who does not hate men and who likes lip gloss and who wears high heels for herself but not for men of course a lot of this was you hate african culture that sort of thing now here 's a story from my childhood when i was in primary school my teacher said at the beginning of term that she would give the class a test you got to write down the names of noisemakers which was having enough power of my teacher would also give you a cane to hold in your hand and i got the highest score on the test then to my surprise my teacher said that the monitor she had forgotten to make that clear earlier because she assumed it was obvious a boy had the second highest score on the test and he now what was even more interesting about this is that the boy was a sweet gentle soul who had no interest in patrolling the class with the cane i often make the mistake of thinking that something that is obvious to me is just as obvious to everyone else now take my dear friend louis for example louis is a brilliant progressive man and we would have conversations and he would tell me i don 't know what you mean by things being different or harder for women maybe in the past but not now self evident then one evening the sprinkling of energetic men who hang around outside establishments and very dramatically you park your car i was impressed with the particular theatrics brought out my money that i had earned from doing my work and i gave it to the man and he this man who was very i didn 't give him the money then i saw realization dawn on louis ' face the man believed that whatever money i had had ultimately come from louis because louis is a man men and women are different we have different hormones we have different sexual organs we have different biological abilities women can have babies men can 't at least not yet men have testosterone and are in general physically stronger than women there 's slightly more women than men in the world put it simply and well when she said the higher you go the fewer women there are in the recent us elections it was really about a man and a woman doing the same job being equally qualified and this made sense a thousand years ago because human beings lived then in a world in which physical strength was the most important attribute for survival the physically person was more likely to lead and men in general are physically stronger of course there are many exceptions the person more likely to lead is not the physically stronger person it is the more more intelligent person the more innovative person and there are no hormones for those attributes a man is as likely as a woman to be intelligent to be creative to be innovative some weeks ago i walked into a lobby of one of the best nigerian hotels i thought about naming the hotel but i thought i probably shouldn 't and a guard at the entrance stopped me and asked me annoying questions and by the way why do these hotels focus on in lagos i cannot go alone into many reputable the waiters are products at this some women felt like yes i thought that the waiters are products of a society that has taught them but it 's one thing to know intellectually i feel upset these are little things but sometimes it 's the little things that sting the most and not long ago i wrote an article about what it means to be young and female in lagos and me it was so angry of course it was angry anger has a long history of bringing about positive change but in addition to being angry i 'm also hopeful because i believe deeply in the ability of human beings to make and remake themselves for the better but i want to focus on nigeria and i would like today to ask that we begin to dream about and plan for a different world a we do a great disservice to boys on how we raise them we stifle the humanity of boys masculinity becomes this hard small cage and we put boys inside the cage in nigerian speak hard man both of them with the same amount of pocket money would go out and then the boy would be expected always to pay to prove his masculinity and yet we wonder why boys are more likely to steal money from their parents what if both boys and girls were raised not to link masculinity with money what if the attitude was not the boy has to pay but rather whoever has more should pay now of course because of that historical advantage then in fifty years in a hundred years boys will no longer have the pressure of having to prove this masculinity but by far the worst thing we do to males by making them feel that they have to be hard is that we leave them with very man feels compelled to be the weaker his ego is we teach girls to shrink themselves to make themselves smaller we say to girls you can have ambition but not too much but not too successful otherwise you would threaten the man what if we decide simply dispose of that word and i don 't think there 's an english word i dislike more than emasculation i was not worried at all in fact it had not occurred to me to be worried because a man who would be intimidated by me is exactly the kind of man i would have no interest in i was really struck by this it can be a source of joy and love and but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don 't teach boys the same i know a woman who decided to sell her house because she didn 't want to intimidate a man who might marry her i know an unmarried woman in nigeria who when she goes to conferences wears a wedding ring because according to her she wants the other participants in the conference to give her i know young women who are under so much pressure from family from friends even from work and they 're pushed to make terrible choices a woman at a certain age who is unmarried our society teaches her to see it as a deep personal failure we just think he hasn 't come around to making his pick it 's easy for us to say oh but women can just say no to all of this but the reality is more difficult and more complex we 're all social beings we internalize ideas from our socialization even the language we use in talking about marriage and relationships illustrates this to mean something a woman shows a man but often not something a man shows a woman both men and women in nigeria will say this is an expression i 'm very amused by i did it for peace in my marriage now when men say it it is usually about something that they should not be doing anyway laughter sometimes they say it to their friends it 's something to say to their friends in a kind of fondly exasperated way something that ultimately proves how masculine they are how needed how loved oh my wife said i can 't go to the club every night so for peace in my marriage i do it only on weekends now when a woman says i did it for peace in my marriage she 's usually talking about giving up a job a dream we teach females that in relationships compromise is what women do we teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are if we have sons we don 't mind knowing about our sons but we don 't praise boys for virginity and it 's always made me wonder how exactly this is supposed to recently a young woman was gang raped in a university in nigeria i think some of us know about that and the response of many young nigerians both male and female was something along the lines of this doing in a room with four boys now if we can forget the horrible inhumanity of that response these nigerians have been raised to think of women as inherently guilty and they have been raised to we teach girls shame we make them feel as though by being born female they 're already guilty of something and so girls grow up to be women who cannot see they have desire they grow up to be women who silence themselves they grow up to be women who cannot say what they truly think and they grow up and this is the worst thing we did to girls they grow up to be women who have turned pretense into an art form i know a woman who hates domestic work she just hates it but she pretends that she likes it because she 's been taught that to be good wife material she has to be to use that nigerian word very homely and after a while her husband 's family began to complain that she had changed actually she had not changed she just got tired of pretending the problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are now imagine how much happier we would be how much freer if we didn 't have the weight of gender expectations boys and girls are undeniably different biologically but socialization exaggerates the differences now take cooking for example but why is that is it because women are born with a cooking gene i used to look up to my grandmother who was a brilliant brilliant woman and wonder how she would have been if she had the same opportunities as men when she was growing up than there were during my grandmother 's time all of which are very important but what matters even more is our attitude our mindset what we believe and what we value about gender what if in raising children we focus on ability instead of gender what if in raising children we focus on interest i know a family who have a son and a daughter both of whom are brilliant at school who are wonderful lovely children when the boy is hungry the parents say to the girl go and cook indomie noodles for your brother now the daughter doesn 't particularly like to cook indomie noodles but she 's and so she has to now what if the parents from the beginning taught both the boy and the girl to cook indomie cooking by the way is a very useful skill for boys to have i 've never never thought it made sense to leave such a crucial thing the ability to nourish oneself but what struck me about them now what if care for his child i 'm but i sometimes still feel very vulnerable in the face of gender expectations i was worried i wasn 't worried about the material i would teach because and i was going to teach what i enjoy teaching instead i was worried about what to wear but i decided not to i wore a very serious very manly and very ugly suit if a woman has to get ready for business meeting she has to worry about looking too feminine and what it says and whether or not she will be taken i wish i had not worn that ugly suit that day i 've actually banished it from my closet by the way had i then the confidence that i have now i have chosen to no longer be apologetic for my for my femininity and i want to be respected in all of my femaleness because i deserve to be gender is not an easy conversation to have for both men and women to bring up gender is sometimes to encounter almost immediate resistance i can imagine some people here are actually thinking women too do sef some of the men here might be thinking ok all of this is interesting but i don 't think like that and that is part of the problem that many men do not actively think about gender or notice gender is part of the problem of gender that like my friend louis that everything is fine now if you are a man and you walk into a restaurant with a woman and the waiter greets only you does it occur to you to ask the waiter why haven 't you greeted her we may repose part of a longer version of this talk so because gender can be a very uncomfortable conversation to have there are very easy ways to close it to close the conversation so some people will bring up evolutionary biology and apes how you know female apes bow down to apes also live on trees and some people will say well poor men but this is not what this conversation is about gender and class are different forms of oppression i actually learned quite a bit about systems of oppression and how they can be blind to one another by talking to black men i was once talking to a black man about gender and he said to me why do you have to experience as a woman ' why can 't it be ' your experience as a human being ' but we can change that bottom power non nigerians bottom power is an expression which i suppose means something like a woman who uses her sexuality to get favors from men but bottom power is not power at all bottom power means that a woman simply has a good root to tap into from time to time somebody else 's and then of course we have to wonder what happens when that somebody else is in a bad mood or sick or impotent but culture is constantly changing i have beautiful twin nieces who are fifteen and live if they had been born a hundred years ago it was our culture to kill twins so what is the point of culture i mean there 's the decorative the dancing but also culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people in my family i am the child who is most interested in the story of who we are in our traditions in the knowledge about ancestral lands my brothers are i cannot go to umunna meetings i cannot have a say because i 'm female culture does not make people people make culture so if it is in fact true so if it is in fact true that the full humanity of women is not our culture i think very often of my dear friend okoloma maduewesi may he and all the others who passed away in that sosoliso crash continue to rest in peace he will always be remembered by those of us who loved him and he was right that day many years ago when he called me a feminist i am feminist a person who believes in the social political and economic equality of the sexes she refused she protested spoke up whenever she felt she was being deprived of access of land that sort of thing my great grandmother did not know that word feminist but it doesn 't mean that she wasn 't one more of us should reclaim that word my own definition of feminist is a feminist is a man or a woman who says a feminist is a man or a woman who says yes there 's a problem with gender as it is today and we must fix it we must do better best feminist i know is my"
