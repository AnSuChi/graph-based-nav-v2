  "transcript": "america 's public energy conversation boils down to this question would you rather die of a oil wars or c nuclear holocaust or d all of the above oh none of the above 's the one we 're not normally offered what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing could we have fuel without fear could we reinvent fire of the world 's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo those fossil fuels have but they also have rising costs and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity but they 're really quite distinct less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil although almost half is made from coal so very efficient but today 's energy system is not just inefficient it is also disconnected dirty and insecure so it needs refurbishment by two thousand and fifty though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal fifty and use one third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply that is expressed as a lump sum today than business as usual assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero conservatively low estimate yet this cheaper energy system could support one hundred and fifty eight percent bigger u s economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running washington gridlock let me say that again i 'm going to tell you how to get the united states completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper in other words we 're going to use our most effective institutions private enterprise with civil society general eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing so in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy buildings industry and electricity but also design and business strategy those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of gdp our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles so let 's start by of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight epidemic obesity has made our two ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have but today ultralight ultrastrong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller indeed that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of victorian engine and steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion the sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones and just in the first two years the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers of course computers and electronics are now america 's biggest industry while typewriter makers have so vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next forty years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil america could lead this next automotive revolution volkswagen announced that by next year they 'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting two hundred and thirty miles a gallon bmw announced this carbon fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries seven years ago and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber which doubles as a carbon cap in one minute and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is tom friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to twelve times as much crash energy per pound as steel if we made all of our autos and all those mega barrels under detroit they are carbon free and inexhaustible the same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles in the five but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two thirds and combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars also today 's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military r & d has given us the internet the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries as we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving instead of just seeing the the travel grow we can use some smart it to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don 't need to go somewhere else and we can use smart those things can give us the same or better access with forty six to eighty four percent less driving so forty years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile u s economy can use no saving or displacing barrels for twenty five bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred adds up to a $ four trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero we can get efficient and then switch fuels those one hundred and twenty five to two hundred and forty autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels the trucks could even use natural gas but no vehicles will need oil and the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made two thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture we figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like ford and walmart and the pentagon and the long transition is already well under way in fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil but in demand and deutsche bank even said in other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices but the electrified vehicles don 't need to burden the electricity grid rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they 're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate varying solar solar and wind power and they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then and those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector because we 've got 21st century technology and speed colliding rules and cultures keep improving faster than we 're installing them so the but as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy america 's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos and we can do this buildings which use three quarters of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving one point four trillion dollars net present value with a thirty three percent internal rate of return or in the savings are worth four times what they cost and industry can accelerate too doubling its energy productivity with a twenty one percent internal rate of return the key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that is how our two thousand and ten retrofit is saving over of the energy in the empire state building remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved seventeen million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years but industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of the world 's electricity runs motors half of that runs pumps and fans and those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by but first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks for example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least eighty six percent less energy this is not about new technology it 's just rearranging our metal furniture of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs well from the coal burned at the power plant and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves ten units of fuel cost pollution and what hunter lovins calls global weirding back at the power plant and of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than thirty billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns everything from data centers and while the new facility designs save forty to 90 odd percent with generally lower capital cost now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables china leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost in fact these and germany now has more solar workers than america has steel workers already in about twenty states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company and this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams renewables are no longer a fringe for each of the past four years half of the world 's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries in two thousand and ten renewables particularly wind and solar cells got one hundred and fifty one billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk in fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of 100 plus percent subsidies well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and combined with renewables can displace them more than twenty three times at less than their replacement cost but we only need to replace them once 're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they 're twenty four seven whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable actually no generator is twenty four seven they all break and when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds that is exactly why we 've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants and in exactly the same way the grid can handle wind and wind and solar power 's forecastable variations hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they 're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location and that 's true both for continental areas like the u s or europe portugal was how all of europe can shift to renewable electricity dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by two thousand and fifty and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same about six trillion dollars at present value whether we buy more of what we 've got or new clean coal or renewables that are more or less centralized but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks finance technology climate and health for example our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and but that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables but can stand alone at need that is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly that approach is exactly what the pentagon is adopting for its own power they think they need that how about the rest of us that they 're defending we want our stuff to work too entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables and those utilities were rewarded as they still are in thirty four states for selling you more electricity especially where regulators are now instead rewarding the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage so our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of gdp could never go down and i suggested it could go down several fold well that 's what 's actually happened so far it 's fallen by half but with today 's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do so to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it and the results may at first seem incredible but as marshall mcluhan said only puny secrets need protection big discoveries are protected by public incredulity reinventing fire where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the united states completely off saving five trillion dollars growing the economy oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions by percent now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about so focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to america 's energy challenge this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty all of which make us now our team at rmi helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching former oil man maurice strong said not all the fossils are in the fuel but as edgar woolard who used to chair dupont reminds us hampered by old thinking won 't be a problem because he said they simply won 't be around long term we humans are inventing a new fire not transient but permanent and but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless and our new book reinventing fire describes how you can capture it so with the conversation just begun at let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other with everyone around you to help make the world richer cooler and safer by together reinventing fire"
