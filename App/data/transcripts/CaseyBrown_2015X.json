  "transcript": "and you control their thinking not like this although that would be cool instead like this anyone here want to be paid well this talk is for everyone it 's got universal applicability it 's true if you 're a business owner if you 're an employee if you 're a job seeker it 's true if you 're a man or a woman now i approach this today through the lens of the woman business owner because in my work i 've observed that women underprice more so than men the gender wage gap is a well traveled narrative in this according to the bureau of labor statistics a woman employee earns just eighty three cents what may surprise you is that this trend continues even into the entrepreneurial sphere a woman business owner earns just eighty cents for every dollar a man earns they say things like i don 't like to toot my own horn i 'd rather let the work speak for itself i don 't like to sing my own praises and i think this difference is costing women twenty cents on the dollar i 'd like to tell you the story of a consulting firm that helps their clients dramatically improve their profitability that company is my company after my first year in business i saw the profit increases that my clients were realizing in working with me and i realized that i needed to reevaluate my pricing i was really underpriced relative to the value i was delivering it 's hard for me to admit to you because i 'm a pricing consultant laughter it 's what i do i help companies price for value 's what i saw and so i sat down to evaluate my pricing evaluate my value and i did that by asking key value questions what value do i i answered these questions and defined the value that my clients get from working with me calculated their return on investment and what i saw was that i needed to double my price double it now i confess to you this terrified me what if nobody would pay me what if clients said that 's ridiculous you 're ridiculous was i really worth that not my work mind you but me was i worth that i but i know how to take my own medicine i prepared the proposals with the new higher pricing and sent them out and communicated the value how 's the story end clients continued to hire me and refer me and recommend me and i 'm still here i share this story because doubts and fears are natural and normal but they don 't define our value and they shouldn 't limit our earning potential i 'd like to share another story about a woman who learned to communicate her value she runs a successful web development company and employs several people when she she would say i have a little web design company she 'd actually use those words with clients i have a little web design company in this and in many other small ways she was diminishing her company in the eyes of prospects and clients and diminishing herself it was really impacting her ability to earn what she was worth i believe her language and her style communicated that she didn 't believe she had much value to offer and so she began her journey to take responsibility for communicating value to clients and changing her message one thing i shared with her is that it 's so important to find your own voice a voice that 's authentic and true to you don 't try to channel your sister in law just because she 's a great salesperson or your neighbor who tells a great joke if that 's not who you are what do you love about what you do what excites you about the work that you do you connect with that communicating your value will come naturally so she embraced her natural style found her voice and changed her message she 's now charging three times as much for web design and her business is growing she said in the old days that would have been a really intimidating meeting for her but her mindset was different she prepared the information sat down with the client she took them through the data through the numbers but very directly said here 's what we 've done for you the client sat up and took notice and said ok i got it and she said in describing that meeting i didn 't feel scared or panicky or small which is how i used to feel instead i feel like i got this i know what i 'm doing i 'm confident ' being properly valued is so important you can hear in this story that the implications range far beyond just finances into the realm of today i 've told two stories one about defining our value and the other about that 's the equation and if you 're sitting in the audience today and you 're not being paid what you 're worth i 'd like to welcome you into this equation how much more we could do how much more we could give back how much more we could plan for the future realize our full value thank you"
