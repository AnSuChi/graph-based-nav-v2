  "transcript": "reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year that 's just one source my question is how many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run that 's the idea behind the long news it 's a project by the long now foundation which was founded by tedsters including kevin kelly and stewart brand and what we 're looking for is news stories that might still matter fifty or one hundred or ten thousand years from now and when you look at the news through that filter a lot falls by the wayside to take the top stories from this last year is this going to matter in a decade or this or this really is this going to matter in fifty or one hundred years okay that was kind of cool so what kind of stories well let 's take science someday little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things that someday is already here if you 're a mouse some recent stories nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom what about resources what about global politics the world 's going to be very different when and if china sets the agenda and they may they 've overtaken the u s as the world 's biggest car market and they 've started doing dna tests on kids to choose their careers there 's an ant colony from argentina that has now spread to every continent but and life may no longer need us either a microbe wakes up after one hundred and twenty thousand years it seems that with or without us life will go on but my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one water found on the moon makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there and if nasa doesn 't do it china might or somebody in this room might write a big check"
