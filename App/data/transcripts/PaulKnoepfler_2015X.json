  "transcript": "what if i could make for you a designer baby what if you as a and i as a scientist decided to go down that road together what if we didn 't what if we thought that 's a bad idea but many of our family friends and coworkers and you 're a parent you have your daughter marianne next to you and in two thousand and thirty she is what we call a natural because she has no genetic modifications and because you and your partner consciously made that decision she was born a genetically modified and these enhancements were introduced using a new genetic modification technology that goes by the funny name crispr you know like something 's crisp this is crispr the scientist that jenna 's parents hired to do this for several million and they predicted that that little tiny embryo jenna 's embryo would be the best of the bunch and now jenna is an actual real person she 's sitting sitting on the carpet in your living room and your families have known each other for years now and it 's become very clear to you she 's incredibly intelligent if you 're honest with yourself she 's smarter than you and she 's five years old and the list goes on and on and in fact there 's a whole new generation and so far it looks like but you can 't help but have this sort of unsettling feeling a gut feeling that there 's something just not quite right about jenna and you 've had the same feeling about other gm kids you were also reading in the newspaper earlier this week that a study of these children who were born as designer babies indicates they may have some issues like increased aggressiveness and narcissism but more immediately on your mind is some news that you just got marianne 's been crying and last night when you took her to bed to kiss her goodnight she said daddy will jenna even i have a feeling that i may have put some of you into this sci fi frame of reference right you think you 're reading a sci fi book or maybe like in halloween mode of thinking i 'm a stem cell and genetics researcher and i can see this new crispr technology and its potential impact consider that the world of science had a huge shock researchers in china just a few months ago reported the creation of genetically modified but i still think they sort of cracked the door ajar and i think some people are going to run with this technology and try to make designer babies now before i go on some of you may hold up your hands and say stop paul wait a minute you can 't just go off and create a designer baby and in fact to some extent you 're right in some countries you couldn 't do that you could do it and there was another development this year that resonates it was illegal there they passed a new law allowing the creation of genetically modified humans with the noble goal of trying to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease so i 've been talking about this crispr technology what actually is crispr so if you think about the gmos that we 're all more familiar with like gmo tomatoes and wheat and things like that so what is it it 's actually like a genetic swiss army knife we can pretend this is a swiss army knife with different tools in it and one of the tools is kind of like a magnifying glass or a gps for our dna so it can home in which came on the scene just three years ago has taken science by storm that i think someone is going to go that extra step and they 're doing important they 're studying human disease and other important elements of science so there 's a lot of good research going on with crispr and the fact that we can now do genetic modifications that used to take years and cost millions of dollars in a few weeks for a couple thousand bucks to me as a scientist that 's fantastic but it opens the door to people going too far and i think for some people the focus is not going to be so much on science that 's not what 's going to be driving them it 's going to be so why should we be concerned about this we know from imagine those trends those forces with a and in fact we can just go back one century to the last century to see the power that eugenics can have he was viennese and he was born here in one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine and when my grandparents had little baby peter the world was very different right it was a different vienna the united states was different the world was different there was a eugenics rising and my grandparents realized pretty quickly i think that they were on the wrong side of the eugenics equation and so despite this being their home and their whole extended family 's home and this area being their family 's home for generations they decided because of and i 'm not sure my dad ever really got over leaving vienna he left when he was just eight years old in one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight it 's supposed to be positive eugenics but i think even though it 's focused on trying to improve people so i have you know eugenics we talk about making better people it 's a tough question what is better when we 're talking about a human being but i admit i think maybe a lot of us could agree that human beings maybe we could use a little betterment look at our politicians here you know back in the us god forbid we go there right now maybe even if we just look in the mirror there might be ways we think instead of baldness some people might wish they were taller have a different weight a different face but there would be risks to so if we forget about enhancing people and we just try to make them healthier using genetic modification this technology is so new and there 's another risk and that all of the legitimate important genetic modification research going on just in the lab again no interest in designer babies that entire field i also think it 's not that unlikely so for example our imagined gm jenna child who is healthier if there 's a generation that looks like they have lower health care costs it 's possible that governments may start trying to compel their citizens it 's thought that in our digital age viral videos social media and they kind of become the new glitterati the new kardashians or something are those trends that we really could control i 'm not convinced that we could so again today it 's halloween and when we talk about genetic modification there 's one halloween associated character that is talked about or invoked more than anything else and that is frankenstein if we about this now and we think about it in the human context on a day like halloween if parents can i don 't think so i don 't think it 's going to get to that extreme but when we are going about hacking the human code i think all bets are off in terms of what might come of that there would still be dangers can look in the past to other elements of transformative science and see how they can basically go out of control and permeate society so i 'll just give you one example and that is in vitro fertilization test tube baby number one louise and that 's a great thing and i think bringing immeasurable happiness a lot of parents now can love and the same kind of thing could happen so depending on the decisions we make in the next few and there 's a difference there too because if we you in the audience or i if we decide to have a designer baby then their children will also be genetically modified and so on because it 's heritable so that 's a big difference so with all of this in mind what should we do there 's actually going to be a meeting a month from tomorrow in washington d c by the us national academy of sciences to tackle that exact question i believe at this time we need a moratorium we have to ban this we should not but there 's a lot of people thanks and let me say just as a scientist it 's a little bit scary for me to say that in public because science generally and things like that and so it 's very possible there may be no and i think part of the problem that we have is that all of this trend this revolution in genetic modification applying to humans the public hasn 't known about it nobody has been this and this could affect you in very personal and depending on the decisions we literally we don 't have a lot of time in the next few months the next year or so because this technology is spreading like wildfire let 's pretend we 're back in that reality we 're at a park and our kid is swinging on the swing and there 's our kid swinging on the swing and their hair is all over the place like mine they 're not the best student in the world but there on the swing next to them their best friend and the two of them are kind of swinging like this and you can they don 't have that stuffy nose you need to wipe how is that going to make you feel and what decision might you make next time"
