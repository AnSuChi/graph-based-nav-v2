  "transcript": "first of all i would like to say that i 'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on tv at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look it seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids like me to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn 't good for us or the planet i also used to think that all of our food came from these happy little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day first there 's genetically engineered seeds and organisms that is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature like taking the dna of a fish and putting it but this is just creepy then grown the food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s and most folks don 't even know did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity and let me tell you corn is in everything and don 't even get me started on the confined animal feeding operations called cafos laughter conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow poisoning our water too i decided that i 'd rather be an organic farmer instead i can have a greater impact on the world since i 'm home schooled i went to go hear him speak one day this man this lunatic farmer doesn or genetically modified seeds and so for that he 's called crazy by the system i want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices by buying our food directly from local farmers or our neighbors who we know in real life but is it really it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer or we can pay the hospital i want you to know i try to share this everywhere i go not too long ago my uncle said that he offered my six year old cousin cereal he asked him if he wanted organic toasted o 's or the sugarcoated flakes you know the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic toasted o 's cereal because birke said he shouldn 't eat sparkly cereal thank you"
