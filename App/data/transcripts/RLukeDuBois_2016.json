  "transcript": "i can 't draw my shop teacher in high school wrote that i was a menace on my report card you probably don 't really want to see my photographs folks like me didn 't exist that it was impossible that art made with data is a new thing it 's a product of our age it 's something that 's really important to think of as something that 's very but there is an art form that 's been around for a very long time that 's really about using information abstract information right and if you think about what music is notes and chords and keys and harmonies and melodies these things are algorithms these things are systems that are designed to unfold over time i came to the arts through music i was trained as a composer and about fifteen years ago i started making pieces that were designed to look at the intersection between sound and image to use an image to unveil a musical structure or to use a sound to show you something interesting about something that 's usually so what you 're seeing on the screen is literally being drawn by the musical structure of the musicians onstage and there 's no accident that it looks like a plant because the underlying so once you know how to do this once you know how to code with media you can do some pretty cool stuff we 've got casablanca on the right we 've got chicago and you can see that casablanca is a little easier to read that 's because the average length of a cinematic shot in the this is a project that was inspired by some work that was funded by the us federal government in the early 2000s to look at video footage and find a specific actor in any video and so i repurposed this code to train a system on one person in our culture who would never need to be surveilled in that manner which is britney spears i downloaded two thousand paparazzi photos of britney spears and trained my computer to find her face i can run any footage of her through it and will center her eyes in the frame and this sort of is a little double commentary about surveillance in our society we are very fraught with anxiety about being watched but then we obsess over celebrity what you 're seeing on the screen here is a collaboration i did with amaris what she did is is very simple to explain and describe but very hard to do she took seventy two minutes of activity getting ready for a night out on the town and stretched it over three days and performed it on a traffic island in slow motion in new york city i was there too with a film crew we filmed the whole thing and then we reversed the process speeding it up to seventy two minutes again so it looks like she 's moving normally and the whole world is flying by at a certain point i figured out that what i was doing was making portraits when you think about portraiture you tend to think about stuff like this the guy on the left is named gilbert stuart he 's sort of the first real portraitist of the united states and on the right is his portrait of george washington from lansdowne portrait and if you look at this painting there 's a lot of symbolism right we 've got a rainbow out the window we 've got a sword we 've got a quill on the desk all of these things are meant to evoke george washington as the father of the nation this is my portrait of george washington and what the words are is the sixty six words in george washington 's state of the union addresses that he uses more than any other president this is the eye chart for george these pieces bill clinton spent a lot of time talking about the century in which he would no longer be president but maybe his wife would be lyndon johnson was the first president to give his state of the union addresses on prime time television he began every paragraph with the word tonight and richard nixon or more accurately his speechwriter a guy named william safire spent a lot of time thinking about language and making sure that his boss portrayed a rhetoric of honesty this project is shown as a series of monolithic sculptures and it 's important to note that they 're to scale so if you stand twenty feet back and you can read between those two black lines you have twenty twenty vision and there 's a lot of these there 's a lot of ways to do this with with data i started looking for a way to think about something that 's more about my country and how it we make a census in the united states we literally count people find out who lives where what kind of jobs we 've got the language we speak at home and this is important stuff really important stuff but it doesn 't really tell us who we are it doesn 't tell us about our dreams and our aspirations and so in and i started looking for a corpus of data that had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary americans and it turns out that there is such a corpus of data that 's just sitting there for the taking it 's called online dating i joined twenty one different online dating services as a gay man a straight man a gay woman and a straight woman in every zip code in america and downloaded about nineteen million people 's dating profiles percent of the adult population of the united states i have obsessive compulsive disorder this is going to become really freaking obvious just go with me so what i did was i sorted all this stuff by zip code and i looked at word analysis these are some dating profiles from two thousand and ten with the word lonely highlighted you can also see that this is the kinky map so what this is showing you is that the women in alaska need to get together with the men in southern new mexico and have a good time and i have this at a pretty granular level so i can tell you that the men in the eastern half of long island are way more interested in being spanked than men in the western half of long island this will be your one takeaway from this whole conference you 're going to remember that fact for like thirty years when you bring this down to a cartographic level you can make maps and do the same trick i was doing with the eye charts you can replace the name of every city in the united states with the word people use more in that city than anywhere else if you 've ever dated anyone from seattle this makes perfect sense i grew up somewhere between and new york city 's number one word is now as in now i 'm working as a waiter but actually i 'm an actor the best place to eat in syracuse new york is a hell 's angels barbecue joint called dinosaur barbecue that 's where you would take this is you can think of this as a quantified so what i 'm doing is running a a physics equation based on my personal data you have to imagine everybody i 've ever corresponded with it started out in the middle and it exploded with a big bang and everybody has gravity to one another gravity based on how much they 've been emailing who they 've been emailing with and it also does sentimental analysis so if i say i love you you 're heavier to me and all the names are handwritten sometimes you do this data and this work with real time data to illuminate a specific problem in a specific city this is a walther ppk 9mm semiautomatic handgun that was used in a shooting in the french quarter of new orleans about two years ago on valentine 's day in an argument over parking those are my cigarettes this is the house where the shooting took place this project involved a little bit of engineering i 've got a bike chain rigged up as a cam shaft with a computer driving it that computer and the mechanism are buried in a box the gun 's on top welded to a steel plate there 's a wire going through to the trigger and the computer in the box is online it 's listening to the nine hundred and eleven feed of the new orleans police department so that anytime there 's a shooting reported in new orleans the gun fires there 's a blank so there 's no bullet there 's big light big noise and most importantly there 's a casing there 's about five shootings a day in new orleans so over the four months this piece was installed the you guys know what this is you call this data visualization when you do it right it 's illuminating when you do it wrong it 's piece for you i spent the last summer as the artist in residence for times square and times square in new york is literally the crossroads of the world one of the things people don 't notice about it is it 's the most instagrammed place on earth and i have them all laughter these are some of them with their eyes centered every civilization will use the maximum level of technology available to make art and it 's the responsibility of the artist to ask questions about what that technology means and how it reflects our culture so i leave you with this we 're more than numbers we 're people and we have dreams and ideas and reducing us to statistics is something that 's done at our peril thank you very much"
