  "transcript": "please think of your biggest personal goal imagine deciding right now that you 're going to do it imagine telling someone that you meet today what you 're going to do imagine their congratulations and their high image of you doesn 't it feel good to say it out loud don 't you feel one step closer already like it 's already becoming part of your identity well bad news you should have kept your mouth shut because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it the repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen there are some steps that need to be done some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it ideally you would not be satisfied until you 'd actually done the work but when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it psychologists have found that it 's called a social reality the mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it 's already done and then because you 've felt that satisfaction you 're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary let 's look at the proof one thousand nine hundred and twenty six kurt lewin founder of social psychology called this substitution mahler found when it was acknowledged by others it felt real in the mind one thousand nine hundred peter gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in two thousand and nine he did some new tests that were published it goes like this sixty three people across four separate tests then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room and half didn 't but they were told that they could stop at any time now those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire but those who had announced it quit after only thirty three minutes on average so if this is true what can we do well you could resist the temptation to announce your goal you can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing okay what will you say"
