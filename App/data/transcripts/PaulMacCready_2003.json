  "transcript": "but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that i 'm working in now as a ornithopters autogyros helicopters gliders and and then navy pilot and but got tangled up with some great professor types who convinced me and everybody else in the field that this was a good way to get into i was in the field of weather modification although getting the weather modification subject was getting and as a graduate student i could go around to the various talks that were being given on a hitchhiker ride to the east coast and and as a result i got the absolutely unique background in that field and started a company which did more research in weather modification than anybody and there are a lot of things that i just can 't go into but then and so we did our small the thing that is exciting was in one thousand nine i made a loan to a friend of one hundred thousand dollars or i guaranteed the money at the bank he needed them he needed the money for starting a so i had a $ one hundred thousand so suddenly i was interested in and did not first was just like they 'd been doing in england and not succeeding and i gave it up i and was studying bird flight just for the and estimate the bank angle and the turning radius and so on which i could do in the car as we 're driving along on a vacation trip with but ridiculing the whole thing very much but that began thinking about how birds went around and the idea of the airplane quickly emerged was so logical one should have thought of it in the first place but one didn 't and it was just keep the weight down seventy pounds was all it weighed but let the size swell up like a hang glider but three times the span three times the cord you 're down to a third of the speed a third of the power and a good bicyclist can put out that power and and we won the prize a year later we a lot of and ones that did work and the plane kept getting a little better a little better got a good but unfortunately about sixty five thousand dollars was spent on the project and there was only about thirty to help retire the debt but fortunately henry kramer who put up the prize for that was a one mile flight put up a new prize for flying the english channel twenty one miles and he thought it would take another eighteen years for somebody to win that we realized that if you just cleaned up our gossamer condor a little bit the power to fly would be decreased a little bit and brian allen was able in a miraculous flight to get the gossamer albatross across the english channel so i only had to pay one third income tax so there were good economic reasons for the project and we have not been involved in any human powered flight since then because the prizes are all over but because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world we didn 't want the and we thought a solar powered plane wouldn 't really make sense but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that i got a prize from the lindbergh foundation their annual prize and i to prepare a paper on it this was the one chance that i had to focus on what i really was after and what was important and i realized the importance which charles lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to and preparing that paper did me a lot of good i thought back about and for a few thousand visits i would see the same thing but this last time and it was just unbelievable the amount of all the the change in one of the biggest changes is two hundred years ago we began using and and and we wonder i wanted to show the slide i think is the most important one any of you will see the year two thousand you see there and this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on are the red line goes up that 's the humans and the green line goes down that 's the wild nature portion humans livestock and pets are now ninety eight percent of the total world 's mass of vertebrates on land and air and you don 't know what the future will hold but it 's not going to get a the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and ninety eight percent and it shows human domination of the earth i give a talk to some remarkable high school students ask them after they 've asked me questions and i give them a talk and so on then i ask them questions what 's the population of the earth what 's the population of the earth going to be when you 're the age of your parents and then what population of the earth would be an equilibrium most of them are saying about two billion and they don 't have any clue about how to get down to two billion nor do i but i think they 're right and this is a rachel carson was thinking of these and came out with silent spring way back solar manifesto by hermann scheer in germany claims all energy on earth can be derived for every country from solar energy and water and we can do things much more efficiently let 's have the next slide so this just summarizes it over billions of years on a unique sphere chance has painted a thin covering of life complex and probable wonderful and fragile suddenly we humans a recently arrived species no longer subject the checks and balances inherent in nature have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush we 're in charge it 's and this is the last one and over the triangle we now get to i have no idea of what comes next so i just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future as a little warning and two weeks after this drawing was done we actually had our first project contract and we produced products and we developed the impact car that general motors made the ev1 out of and got the air resources board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars but they 've we 've done a lot of i have a helios we have the first video narrator with a wingspan of two hundred and forty seven feet this makes her larger than a boeing seven her designers ' attention to detail and her construction gives helios ' structure the flexibility and strength to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere this enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she 's sliding along on the ocean waves paul maccready the wings could touch together on top and not break turning her back to the sun to maximize the power from her solar array and the outside air temperatures drop below minus one hundred degrees fahrenheit except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors p m helios is standing on top of ninety eight percent of the earth 's atmosphere this is more than ten thousand feet higher than the previous that plane has many purposes but it this shows it sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator and it is rugged enough to self land without damage pm okay and let 's have the next applause that plane is widely used by the going to end our visit with paul maccready 's flying circus by meeting his son tyler who with his two brothers helped build the gossamer condor twenty five years ago tyler maccready you can chase it like this for hours aa when they got bored with their father 's project they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own tm and i can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing or on the other aa they called it their walkalong glider the production version seemed to dive a little bit and so i would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit before you try flying it like a seagull soaring on a cliff it goes around your body some has to go over you the launch and you can control it like that you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another so i can do it oops that was going to be a right turn okay this one will be a left wherever you want and it 's just hours of fun and these are no longer in production so you have real collector 's items laughter and this we just wanted to show you if we can get the video running on this yeah just an example of a little video surveillance laughter this was flying around in the party last night and you can see how it just can fly around and you can spy on anybody you want"
