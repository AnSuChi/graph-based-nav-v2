  "transcript": "but have you seen anything in nature an animal that has three legs probably not so why do i call this biologically inspired robot how would it work but before that let 's look at pop culture so you know worlds novel and movie and what you see over here is a very popular this is an actual dynamic simulation animation it flips its body one hundred and eighty degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall so that 's how it walks but when you look at us human being bipedal walking what you 're doing what you 're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall stand up again swing your leg and catch the fall potential energy to kinetic energy what you see over here this is what we want to do next we want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long range motion and it deploys legs it looks almost like star wars when it lands it absorbs the shock and starts walking what you see over here this yellow thing this is not a death ray this is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors because it is tall it 's one point eight meters tall can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things so we have two prototypes the first version in the back that 's strider i the one in front the smaller is strider ii the problem that we had with strider i is it was just too heavy in the body we had so many motors you know so we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors and with a single motor we can coordinate all the it 's still not perfected its coffee falls down so we still have a lot of work to do it stands for intelligent mobility platform with actuated spoke system so it 's a wheel leg hybrid robot let me demonstrate how it works so in this video we 're using an approach called the reactive approach it 's trying to walk over a changing terrain a soft terrain where it in this case where it uses a laser range finder and camera systems to identify the obstacle and it plans carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility you probably haven 't seen anything like this out there this is a very high mobility robot that we developed called impass ah when you steer your car you use a method called ackermann steering the front wheels rotate like this for most small wheeled robots they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel we just simply change the length of the spoke nasa jpl scientists at jpl they are famous for the mars rovers and the scientists geologists always tell me that the real interesting science the science rich sites are always at the but the current rovers cannot get there so inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb it has three legs it 's probably difficult to see but it has a winch and a cable at the top and and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing also for search and rescue applications as well five years ago i actually worked at nasa jpl during the summer as a faculty fellow and they already had a we actually have a very interesting payload on there the students like to have fun and here you can see that it 's walking over size of the sand the foot 's soil sinkage model changes so it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things and also it does some fun stuff as can imagine we get so many visitors visiting our this robot is we store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward it we also have been working with some scientists and engineers from upenn to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot to something and just like magic it this robot is a very recent project it 's called raphael robotic air powered hand with elastic ligaments so for prosthesis applications it 's probably not too practical because it 's not affordable we wanted to go we 're using compressed air we developed these novel actuators for joints it is and it can actually crush an empty soda can it can pick up very delicate objects like a the cable and this student probably the first time using it but she can articulate it many different ways so for example in iraq you know the war zone there is roadside bombs currently it takes really a lot of time and it 's expensive to train the operator to in this case it 's very intuitive this student probably his first time using it doing very complex picking up objects and doing manipulation just like that very intuitive this robot is currently our star robot we actually have a fan club for the robot darwin as you know we are very interested in humanoid robot human walking so we decided to build a small humanoid robot this was in two thousand this was more of a feasibility study what kind of motors should we use you know what happens so based on that success the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics and thus darwin lithium artificial intelligence let 's see how it does this was our very first trial and international autonomous robot soccer competition and the goal of robocup the actual goal is by the year two thousand and fifty we want to have full size we were the very first team in the united states that qualified in the humanoid this is this year in austria this is the beautiful louis vuitton cup trophy so this is for the best humanoid and we would like to bring this for the very first time to the united states next year so wish us luck thank darwin also has a lot of other talents last year it actually conducted the roanoke symphony orchestra for the and it 's trying to show off its ability i 'm macho i 'm strong i can also do some jackie martial art movements this is darwin stay tuned all we have we also have the world 's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind we call it the blind driver challenge very exciting and many many other robotics projects i want to talk about these are just the awards that we won in two thousand and seven fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things so really we have five secrets i lie down close my eyes and i see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around and they assemble and they form these kinds of mechanisms and then i think many times it 's empty sometimes i have something there if something 's junk but most of the time i can 't even read my handwriting and so and i have this eureka moment i directly run at our lab romela the robotics and mechanisms laboratory we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions so we gather around we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it but before we start we set this golden rule this is important because many times students they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts so once you do this it is amazing how the students open up they have these wacky cool crazy and this is how we well we 're running out of time one more thing i want to talk about is i think it was sir ken robinson was it he gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity well actually there are two sides there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition if you want to go beyond a tinkering if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that this is where school comes in scientists these tools these are the courses and classes you take in class physics even nowadays chemistry and biology as you 've seen these are all the tools that we need so the for us more tools to attack these"
