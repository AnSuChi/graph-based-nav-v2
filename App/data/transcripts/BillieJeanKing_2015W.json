  "transcript": "bobby riggs he was the former number one player he wasn 't just some hacker by the way he was one of my heroes and that 's the reason i beat him actually because i respected him ever but i knew it was about social change and i felt like the whole world was on my 's going to put women back fifty years at least title ix had just been passed the year before june and women 's professional tennis one dollar contract in one thousand nine hundred and seventy now remember the match is in ' seventy three so there were nine of us that signed that our dream was for any girl born any place in the world if she was good enough there would be a place for her to compete and we were under the control of organizations so we really wanted to break away from that but we knew it wasn 't really our generation so much we knew it was about the future generations we do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us there is no question but every generation has the chance to make it better i really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to title ix title ix in case anybody doesn 't know which a lot of people probably don 't said that any federal funds college or either public or private had to finally give and that changed everything so i wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds but two things they actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise some women have waited ten fifteen years to ask i said more importantly did you get it and they did and for the men a lot of the men today don 't realize it but if you 're in your 50s 60s or come up to me and i am so happy i saw that as a young man and one of those young men at twelve years old was president obama and he actually told me that when i met him he said and it has made a difference in how i raise them so both men and women got a lot out of it but different things pm and now there are generations at least one or two who have experienced the equality they got to play team sports in a way they hadn 't before so you you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes and the women 's sports foundation what now are you looking to accomplish with at eleven i wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world and a friend had asked me to play and i said what 's that tennis was not in my family basketball was other sports fast forward to twelve years old and i 'm finally starting to play in tournaments where you get a ranking at the end of the year so i was daydreaming at the los angeles tennis club and i started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was but also that everybody who played wore white shoes white clothes played with white balls everybody who played was and that tennis if i was fortunate enough to become number one and i knew being a girl it would be harder to have influence already at that age i had this platform and tennis is global and i thought you know what but making it is a whole other discussion that 's who i truly am unfortunately women and so my attentions where did they have to go it was just you have to you hear the same words keep coming out all the and i think if you can see it you can be it you know if you can see it you can because everyone everyone can do something extraordinary every single person pm and your story billie has inspired so many women everywhere now with the billie jean king leadership initiative you 're taking on an even bigger cause because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice but what you 're talking about is even bigger than that it 's inclusive leadership and this is a generation that has grown up thinking more but the billie jean king leadership initiative is really about the workforce mostly and trying to change it so people can actually go to work and be their authentic selves because most of us straightens her hair in the bathroom goes to the bathroom probably four five six times a day to keep straightening her hair to keep making sure she fits in whatever that may be but she 's also trying to fit in or this poor man who kept his diploma he went to ever just would not mention it so he made sure and then you see a gay guy who has an nfl which means american football for all of you out there it 's a big deal it 's very macho and he talked about football all the time because he was gay and my wish and we catch ourselves i mean i catch myself to this day even being gay i catch myself like feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin so i think you have to ask yourself and the first research the leadership initiative did showed many of us have the problem of being authentic but what you 've just looked at is this millennial generation who have benefited from all these equal opportunities which may not be equal but exist everywhere bjk first of all i 'm really lucky partnership with teneo a strategic company that 's amazing and then deloitte the one thing i wanted was data so deloitte sent out a survey and going to get representation so if you walk into a room you see everybody represented that 's not good enough anymore so the millennials are fantastic they want connection just want you to tell us what you 're feeling what you 're thinking and get into the solution you 've got the information at your fingertips compared to when i was growing up pm bjk well in percent of the global workforce is going to be millennials i think they are going to help i think they have the wherewithal to do it i know they care a lot they have big ideas and they can make big things happen i want to stay in the now with the young people mini survey i 've been talking to the boomers who are their bosses and i go she gets a text from one of the workers just starting she goes oh by the way i 'm going to be late because i 'm at the hairdresser 's that 's what scares the boomers i 'm just telling you so i think it 's good for us to share no it is good for us to share because we 're our authentic selves and what we 're really feeling so we 've got to take it both ways you know but i have great faith because if you 've been in sports like i have every generation gets better it 's a fact with the women 's sports foundation being the it 's in a tenuous position always so we really are concerned and we do a lot of research but we really have to protect what title stands for worldwide and you heard president carter talk about how title ix is protected and do you know that every single lawsuit that girls at least in sports have gone up against whatever but we we still have to get the hearts and minds the hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge huge pm so what gets you up every morning extending it always exploring new areas trying to find new ways bjk well i always drove my parents crazy because i was always the curious one i 'm highly motivated my younger brother was a major league baseball player my poor parents did not care laughter and we drove them crazy because we pushed we pushed because we wanted to be the best and i think to listen to these different women to listen to different people to listen to president carter ninety years old by the way and he that 's amazing i 'm sorry these are things that for some people are very hard to hear but always remember every one of us is an individual a human being with a beating heart who cares but everyone has i think we all have an obligation to continue to keep moving the needle forward you out there listening out there in the world plus the people here every single person 's an influencer never ever forget that ok so don 't ever give up on yourself"
