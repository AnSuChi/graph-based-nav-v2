  "transcript": "it 's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof you know that kids this is how the rooftop looks and why did we design this the principal of this kindergarten said no i don 't want a handrail i said it 's impossible but so that it can catch the children falling off i said it 's impossible and of course the government official said of course you have to have a handrail but we could keep that idea around the trees there are three trees were allowed to call this rope and you get more he loves the tree so he is eating the tree and at the time of an event they sit on the edge it looks so nice from underneath monkeys in the zoo you see only the ceiling and the leg washing place there are many kinds of water taps and the one in front is quite normal but if you look at this the boy is not washing his boots he 's putting water into his boots and also there is no boundary when you put many children in a quiet and the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn 't want to stay in the room we let him go he will come back eventually because it 's a circle just and you know that children they need noise and you know you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar these days we are trying to make everything under control you know it 's and you should know that we can go skiing in minus twenty degrees in winter in summer you go the sand is fifty degrees you never melt so that is how we should treat them this is how they divide classrooms they are and there are always and this is where santa claus comes down at the time of christmas the building is only five meters tall so we put our children he hit his head he 's okay his skull is quite strong he is resilient it 's my son and then we put other children traffic jam is awful in tokyo as you know the driver in front she needs to learn how to drive now and in this kind of occasion to help each other this is society this is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days but the surprise is yet to come the don 't train them we leave them on top of the just like sheep they keep running my point is don 't control them they need to get some injury i think architecture is capable of changing this world and people 's lives and this is one of the attempts thank you very much"
