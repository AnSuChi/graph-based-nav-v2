  "transcript": "invented something they got a patent in to assist women in giving birth round table and some machinery when the woman is ready to deliver her child she lies on her back she is strapped down to the table and the table is rotated at high speed the child comes flying out through centrifugal force if you look at their patent carefully you may decide that you see one or two points where the design is not doctor ivan schwab in california is one of the people one of the main people who helped answer the question why don 't woodpeckers get headaches and it turns out the answer to that is because their brains are packaged inside their skulls in a way different from the way our brains we being human have our brains packaged typically will peck they will bang their head on a piece of wood thousands of times every day and as far as anyone knows that doesn 't bother them in the slightest how does this happen their brain does not slosh around like ours does their brain is packed in very at least for blows coming right from the front not too many people paid attention to this research until the last few years when in this country especially people are becoming curious about what happens to the brains of football players who bang their heads repeatedly and the woodpecker maybe relates to that there was a paper published in the medical journal the lancet in england a few years ago called a man who pricked his finger and smelled putrid for five years dr caroline mills and her team received this patient and then he started to smell really really bad so bad that when he got in a room he in new zealand dr lianne parkin and her team tested an old tradition in and in the winter there it gets very cold and very icy there are lots of injuries the tradition that they tested they tested by asking people who were on their way to work in the morning to stop and try something out try one of two conditions the tradition is that you wear your socks on the outside of your boots and what they discovered by experiment and it was quite graphic when they saw it was that it 's true that if you wear your socks on the outside rather than the inside you 're much more likely now i hope you will agree with me that these things i 've just described to you each of them deserves some kind of prize and that 's what they got each of them got an ig nobel prize in every year we give it 's that you 've done something that makes people laugh and then think what you 've done makes people laugh whatever it is there 's something about it that when people encounter it at first their only possible reaction is to laugh and then a week later it 's still rattling around in their heads and all they want to do is tell their friends about it that 's the quality we look for every year we get consistently between ten percent and twenty percent of those nominations are people who nominate it 's very difficult numerically to win a prize if you want to we offer them the chance to if they want to almost everyone who 's offered a prize decides to accept you get several things you get an ig nobel prize the design is different every year these are always handmade from extremely two thousand and thirteen most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash some money we don 't have any money so we can 't give them in fact the winners have to each of the ten ig nobel prize winners received from us bill from zimbabwe you may remember that zimbabwe had a little adventure for a few years there of inflation the man responsible who runs the national bank there by the way won an ig nobel prize in mathematics the other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony which happens at harvard university you come to harvard 's biggest meeting place and classroom it fits one thousand one hundred people it 's jammed to the gills and up on the stage waiting to shake your hand waiting to hand you your ig nobel prize are a bunch of nobel prize winners that 's the heart of the ceremony the winners are kept i am going to tell you about just a very few of the other medical related prizes we 've given keep in mind we 've given two hundred and thirty prizes there are lots of these people who walk among you maybe you have one a paper was published about thirty years ago called injuries due to falling coconuts by dr peter barss who is canadian dr barss came to the ceremony and explained that as a young doctor he wanted to see the world so he went to papua new guinea when he got there he went to work in a hospital and he was curious what kinds of things happen to people that that bring them to the hospital he looked through the records and he discovered that a surprisingly large number of people in that hospital were there because of injuries due to falling coconuts one typical thing that happens is people will come from the highlands where there are not many coconut trees down to visit their relatives on the coast where there are lots and they 'll think that a coconut tree is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down a coconut tree that is ninety feet tall and has coconuts that weigh two pounds that can drop off at any time you 're all familiar with colonoscopies one way or another they in these papers explained to their fellow doctors who perform colonoscopies how to minimize the chance that when you perform a colonoscopy your patient will explode where he explained the history of this when colonoscopies were becoming a common and there were some difficulties at first basic problem i 'm sure you 're familiar with that dark place and so you want to have a larger space you add some gas to inflate it so you have room to look around now that 's added to the gas the methane gas that 's already so you had methane gas which is flammable oxygen they stopped using oxygen pretty quickly now it 's rare that dr elena bodnar dr elena bodnar invented a brassiere that in an emergency can be quickly separated into a pair of protective face masks one to save your life one to save the life of some lucky bystander why would someone do this you might wonder dr bodnar came to the ceremony and she explained that she grew up in ukraine she was one of the doctors who treated victims of and they later discovered that a lot of the worst medical problems came from the particles people breathed in so she was always thinking after that about could there be some simple mask that was available everywhere when the unexpected happens years later she moved to america she had a baby one day she looked and on the floor her infant son had picked up her bra and had her bra on his face and that 's where the idea came from she came to the ig nobel ceremony with the first prototype of the bra and she demonstrated"
