  "transcript": "let me share with you today but i want to tell it to you the way it really happened not the way i present it in a scientific meeting or the way you 'd read it in a scientific paper story about beyond biomimetics to something i 'm calling biomutualism i define that as an association between biology and another discipline where each discipline reciprocally advances the other but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field but then integrating that with the best human engineering ultimately to make something actually better than nature now and what we found was structures on their toes with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug and each of those hairs has the worst case of split ends possible about one hundred to one thousand split ends that are nano size and the individual has two billion of these nano size split ends they don 't stick by velcro or suction or glue they actually stick by intermolecular forces alone van der waals forces and i 'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self cleaning dry adhesive has been made from the simplest version in nature one branch my engineering collaborator ron fearing at berkeley had made the first synthetic version but used the same general principles and here is its first test 's kellar autumn my former ph d student professor now at lewis and clark literally giving his first born child up for this test lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of hollywood and science man so you 're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko lynn verinsky ha wow and what a privilege that has been robert full that 's what she did on rough surfaces but she actually used these on smooth surfaces two of them to climb up and pull herself up and you can try this in the the gecko inspired material well i 'm really excited today to show you the newest version here is what it does able to do in designing this incredible robot oh one thing i want to point out is look at stickybot it has a tail and just when you think you 've figured out nature this kind of thing happens they fall off the wall so what they did was they asked us an important question they said well it kind of looks like a tail even though we put a passive bar there do animals use their tails when they climb up walls what they were doing was returning the favor by giving us a hypothesis to test in biology that we wouldn 't have thought of we know that you can grab onto things with them and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance it can also act as a counterbalance so watch this kangaroo now mostly tails limit maneuverability like this human inside this dinosaur suit my colleagues actually went on to test this limitation so they had a tail and running them through and obstacle course and found a decrement in performance like you 'd predict this is a passive tail and you can also have active tails and when i went back to research that one of the great ted moments in the past from nathan we 've talked about an active tail video myhrvold thinks tail cracking dinosaurs were interested in love not war robert full and see what it does with its tail this is what we discovered or a tree and they get to the top and let 's say there 's some leaves there and what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf and there was some wind or we shook it and we did that experiment that you see here and this is what we discovered now that 's real time you can 't see anything but there it is slowed down what we discovered was the world 's fastest air righting response for those of you who remember your physics that 's a zero angular momentum righting response so they do it with this active tail as they swing around and then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture so for ted we actually built a robot with a robot if we could have the lights on it and show the video so all you need is a swing of course we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations so we thought oh that 's okay we 'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel we and see what it does so we did and here is what it does so the wind is coming from the slowed down ten times but actually it 's quite beautiful when you take a picture of so we can maneuver this way and then we had to film this several times to believe this but watch its front legs can you see what they are doing what does that mean for the origin of flapping flight maybe it 's evolved from coming down from trees and trying to control a glide stay tuned for that so then we wondered can they actually maneuver with this so there is the landing target could they steer towards it with these capabilities here it is in the wind tunnel and it definitely moving towards the landing target watch the whip of its tail as it does and see if it actually does this completely opposite of the way you 'd see it on a nature film of course there is a red trajectory line look at the end to see the animal so there it comes down there is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line you see it there there watch it come down now watch up there and you can see the landing did you see it hit it actually uses its tail too just like we saw in the lab"
