  "transcript": "that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy there 's only one good thing i can think of when it gets to mosquitos when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife why and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos some of us are just more attractive than others so my wife smells nicer than i do i just stink more than she does either way mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out they smell us and during my ph d i wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used african malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night and there 's a whole range of compounds that they do use and this was not going to be an easy task because half the world 's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite and paul levy this morning he was talking about the metaphor of the seven we have the equivalent of seven jumbo now solving this puzzle was not an easy because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed first we observed strange so we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer and we found some remarkable differences on the left here you see the bites they had a very strong preference for biting on the face in contrast the african malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and that of course we should have known all along and so we started focusing on the smell of feet on the smell of human feet until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse think of it and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment we tried with a tiny little piece which smells badly after feet to attract african malaria mosquitos and you know what it worked it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of limburger cheese that we 're using in tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos be proud of your cheese as it is now used in the fight against malaria that 's the cheese just to show you my second story it 's about man 's best friend it 's about dogs and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria one of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults it 's to kill them when they 're still in the water why because they are just like the cia in that pool of water these larvae are concentrated they 're all together there they are immobile they can 't escape from that water they can 't fly so the problem that we face with this is that throughout the landscape all these pools of water with the larvae they are scattered all over the place and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae and then did something very remarkable which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria this lady is ellen van der zweep she 's one of the best dog trainers in the world and she believes that we can do a lot more since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites smell different compared to people that are uninfected she 's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite man 's best friend in the fight against malaria has never been shown to the public until today but i believe it 's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever in fact people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos and the answer i have right here in my pocket and when i take it with water here in this box i have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitos that i 'm just about to release just kidding what i 'm going to show you is i 'm gonna stick my arm into it and i will show you how quickly they will bite don 't worry i do this all the time in the lab there we go now on the video on the video here i 'm going to show you exactly the same thing except that what i 'm showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tablet have a look that doesn 't work sorry about that i 'm sticking in my arm i 'm giving them a big juicy blood meal i 'm shaking them off and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very very sick indeed here shown in fast motion and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos and i 'm going to say ladies and gentlemen we have swapped the cards with mosquitos don 't kill us we kill now maastricht be prepared now think of what we can do with this we can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito born diseases of epidemics that would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease"
