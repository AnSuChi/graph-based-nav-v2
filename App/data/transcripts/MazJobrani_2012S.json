  "transcript": "it 's such an international place it feels like the united nations you land at the airport and you 're welcomed by an indian lady who takes you to al maha services where you meet a filipino lady who hands you off to a south african lady who then takes you to a korean who takes you to and then then a swedish guy showed me my room i said where are the qataris but they don 't know it that well and i asked him to take me to the i was on my way home from the airport i got a job i 'm working already the middle east has been an adventure the past couple of years it is going crazy with with the arab spring and revolution and all this are there any lebanese here tonight by applause lebanese yeah the middle east is going crazy you know the middle east is going crazy when lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region would have thought oh how many kisses are we going to do every country is different and it 's confusing okay in lebanon they do three i went for three he wasn 't into it next time you see a saudi look closely they 're just a little bit tilted why is that are you too tired to go all the way around i need to rest iranians sometimes we do two sometimes we do three a friend of mine explained to me before the ' seventy nine revolution it was two so with iranians you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you yeah if you go one two three i can 't believe you support this regime with your three kisses laughter but no guys really it is exciting to be here and like i said you guys are doing a lot you know and it 's amazing and it helps change the image of the middle east in the west a lot of americans don 't know a lot about us about the middle east i 'm iranian and american i 'm there i know i it came out on comedy central i went online to see what people were saying i ended up on a conservative website one guy wrote another guy he said i never knew these people and i wish more americans would travel here i always encourage my friends travel see the middle east there 's so much to and it helps stop problems of of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening for example i don 't know if you heard about this a little while ago in the us there was a muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane talking about the safest place to sit on the plane some passengers overheard them somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk it was a family apparently we can 't even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane so my advice to all my middle eastern friends and muslim friends and anyone who looks middle eastern or muslim so to you know indians and latinos everyone if you 're brown here 's my advice to my brown friends just speak your mother tongue that way no one knows what you 're saying life goes on granted some mother tongues might sound a little threatening to the average american if you 're walking down the aisle speaking arabic you might freak them out what 's he talking about the key to my arab brothers and sisters is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as you 're walking down the aisle just as you 're walking down going to hijack the plane with some ice cream thank you very much have a good night thank you"
