  "transcript": "i was born in switzerland marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in ghana but then by the end of the decade the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine i witnessed my first military coup it was a dimly lit shack there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded fired and i think i started feeling the need to and it worked so here i was in two thousand and eight and i felt i was being typecast as an actor i was always playing the exotic african and i was thinking how many terrorists could i possibly play before turning into one myself and i and fortunately i decided in two thousand and eight to return to ghana after twenty eight years of absence i wanted to document on film the two thousand and eight presidential elections and before i even knew it i was suddenly on a stage surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political and i realized that when i 'd left the country free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a were a dream and i was thinking was ghana searching for its identity and it was as if through the standards of my now in ghana was the first sub saharan country to gain its independence i mean today singapore is a first world country and ghana is not but maybe it was time to prove to myself yes it 's important to understand the past it is important to look at it in a different light but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present so here i was december 7th two thousand and eight the polling stations opened to the to the voters at seven eager to take their own political fate into their hands and i asked one of the voters i said whom are you going to vote for and he said i 'm sorry i can 't tell you he said that his vote was in his heart and i understood this was their election and weren 't going to let anyone take it away from them now the first round of the voting didn 't bring forth a clear winner so nobody had achieved the absolute majority so voting went into a second round three weeks later the rhetoric of the candidates of course changed the heat was on and then the cliche came to haunt us inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets people were being beaten brutally because i thought here we are again here is another proof and not only that i am documenting it documenting my own cultural shortcomings so when the echo of the gunshots we want peace and i realized it had to come from the people and they did so the sounds that were before distorted and loud were suddenly a melody the sounds of the voices were harmonious so it could happen a democracy could be upheld peacefully now here 's an interesting comparison we in the west we preach the but when it comes down to it ghana found itself in the same place but instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide and its people it didn 't leave it up to the supreme court to decide the people did now the electoral commissioner declared with the consent of the parties to run an so the people went back to the polls the defeated candidate they did not abuse their power the belief in true democracy now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted now i have learned that my but i saw ghana create democracy better ghana taught me we africans can thank you"
