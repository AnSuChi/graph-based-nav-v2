  "transcript": "or maybe an owl out of the air i was preaching in san jose some time ago and my friend mark kvamme who helped introduce me to this conference brought several ceos to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion because he made that decision but some years ago i was on an elevator in philadelphia coming down i was to address a conference and on that elevator a man said i hear billy graham is staying in this hotel and another man looked in my direction and said there he is he 's on this elevator with us and he said my what an anticlimax after all these tremendous but i was on an airplane in the east some years ago and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte north carolina his name was john belk some of you will probably know him and he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by and john belk said do you know who 's sitting here and the man and he turned to me and he said put her there he said your sermons have certainly helped me and i suppose that that that 's true with thousands of people i would like to live in that age and i know that my time is brief and that 's the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here because i have parkinson 's disease in addition to that and some other problems that i won 't talk about laughter but and there 's one that i want to talk about the nation of the people of israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the near east and king david became one of the great leaders of his generation he was a brilliant soldier with strategies in battle and conflict that people study but about two centuries before david the hittites had discovered the secret of smelting but they wouldn 't allow the israelis but david changed all of that and he introduced the iron age to israel and the bible says that david laid up great stores of iron now instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones israel now had iron plows and sickles and hoes and military weapons israel was completely changed the introduction of iron in some ways had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation that there were many problems that technology could not solve there were many problems and i haven 't heard anybody here speak how do we solve these three problems that i 'd like to mention the first one that david saw was human evil how do we solve it over again which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world and yet he says he restores have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are on one hand we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology as this conference vividly demonstrates we 've seen under the sea three miles down or galaxies but on the other hand something is wrong our battleships almost ready to go to war now what causes this and revolutions racism even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle i would like to see oracle take up that or some other technological geniuses work on this how do we change man so that he doesn 't lie and cheat our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever within our hearts and our souls our problem is that we are separated from our creator which we call god and we need to have our souls restored something only god do jesus said for out of the heart slander but he said it 's in our hearts that the and it 's from our hearts that it must be plucked out albert einstein and i met mr einstein he didn 't have a doctor 's degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him one but he made this statement it 's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man and many of you i 'm sure have thought about that and puzzled over it you 've seen people and twist them into something the oklahoma city the problem is the person or persons using it king david said that he knew the depths of his own soul he couldn 't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery yet king david sought god 's forgiveness and said you can restore my soul you see the bible teaches that we 're more than a body and a mind and there 's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding that 's the part of us that yearns for god or something more than we find your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life i find [ that ] young people all over the world are searching for something and i have many questions and answer periods and whether it 's cambridge or harvard or oxford i 've spoken at all of those universities i 'm going to harvard in about three or four no it 's about two months from now to give a lecture and i 'll be asked the same questions that i was asked the last few times i 've been there and it 'll be on where am i going what 's life all about why am i here thomas edison also said when you see everything that happens in the world of science and in the working of the universe you cannot deny that there 's a captain on the bridge i remember once i sat beside mrs gorbachev i went to ambassador dobrynin whom i knew very well and i 'd been to russia several times and i knew mr dobrynin very well and i said i 'm going to sit beside what shall i talk to her about and he surprised me with the answer he said talk to her about religion and philosophy that 's what she 's really interested in i was a little bit surprised but that evening and it was a stimulating conversation but i know that there 's something up there the second problem that king david realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering and he said man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward yes to be sure science has done much to push back certain types of human be eighty years of age i admit that i 'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years my doctors at the mayo clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this to be here i haven 't given a talk in nearly and when you speak as much as i do three or four times a day get rusty that 's the reason i 'm using this podium and using these notes every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere i 'm ad libbing i i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture i talk ad but tonight i 've got some notes here so that if most we have poverty i 've never met a person in the world that didn 't have a problem it 's an age old question yet david again and again said that he would turn to god he said the lord is my shepherd the final problem that david knew he could not solve was death most people live as if technology projects the myth of control over our mortality and our many young people think she 's still alive or clark gable or whoever it is the old stars they come to life and they 're they 're just as great on that screen as they were in person i spoke some time ago to and i said there 's one thing that we have in common in this room all of us together whether republican or democrat or whoever and we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us and it 's often difficult for young people to understand that it as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote he said i 've stood at the deathbed and yet a few years earlier i talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor she said he and he said for the first time in his life he 'd thought about a few years ago a university student asked me surprise in your life and i said the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life it passes so fast wernher von braun in the aftermath of world war ii concluded quote science and religion are not antagonists on the contrary he put it on a personal basis i knew dr von braun very well i can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator he also said i 've come to believe that the life of jesus christ the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind i 've done a lot of speaking in germany and i was invited one day to visit chancellor adenauer and he once and he said to me he said young man he said do you believe in the resurrection of jesus christ and i said sir i do he said so do i he said when i leave i 'm going to spend my time writing a book on why jesus christ rose again and why it 's so important to believe that alexander solzhenitsyn who says to those gathered around his bed the moment when it 's terrible to blaise pascal pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization he was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics even as a teenager he is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory and a creator of the first model of a computer he was astounded at the phenomenon we 've been considering self hatreds pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and two centuries later seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to but he believed he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason which reason knows not of essentially he said this if you bet on god then you can lose it all in this life and the life to come the knowledge of god was far beyond he was ready to face him when he died at the age of thirty nine king david and he wrote these words words even though i will fear no evil for you are with me it can be yours as well as you seek the living god and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future when i was seventeen years of age and i worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies i didn 't make them in college until something happened in my heart one day i was faced with christ he said i am the way the truth and the life can you imagine or he was what he claimed to be which was he i couldn 't take it to a laboratory but by and he came into my heart and changed my life and now thank you and god bless all of you"
