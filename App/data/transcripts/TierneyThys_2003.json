  "transcript": "asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment ninety percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean and it 's where life the title of and it 's a lively and a lovely place but we 're rapidly changing the oceans with our not only with our our overfishing our irresponsible fishing but also most recently with climate change and steve schneider i 'm sure will be going into greater detail on this now as we continue to tinker with the oceans and this might be the kind of seas we 're headed for and you 'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up about one hundred grams of jellyfish equals so it may be good for the waistline but it probably won 't keep you satiated for very long and a sea that 's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn 't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans that is unless you eat jellyfish and that predator is the giant ocean sunfish the mola mola whose primary prey the guinness world book of records for being the world 's heaviest bony fish it reaches up to almost five thousand pounds and i think it 's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the mola mola its common name is sunfish that its favorite food is even if one is eating the other now this is typically how you see but that 's a typical behavior they lie out and bask on the surface mola mola you know you look at sharks and they 're like torpedoes they just give away their agenda they 're about migration and strength and then you look at the sunfish and this is just so elegantly mysterious it 's just it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than so i was just intrigued with what you know nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution the mola 's no exception they appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction oblige me a little kipling esque storytelling here of course evolution is somewhat random and you know about fifty five million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said oh the heck with the coral reefs we 're going to head to the high seas and we turn they look maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished abridged perhaps but in fact in fact they are the they vie for the top position of the most fish in the sea right up there with and they 're pretty modern just fifty million years ago so and they 're in the guinness world book of records again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet a single four foot female had three hundred million eggs can carry three hundred million eggs in her ovaries imagine and they get to be over ten feet long imagine what a ten foot one has they pass through this spiky they school as adolescents and that 's a little diver up there in the corner they 're in the guinness world book of records again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world from their little hatching size of their egg into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood they put on six hundred million times an increase in weight six hundred million now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby and you had to feed this thing that would mean that your child you would expect it to gain the weight of six titanics feed a child like that but we don 't know how fast the molas grow in in the wild but captive growth studies at the monterey bay aquarium one of the first places to have them in captivity they had one i said now that 's a true american even though they don 't school they still get caught in nets as by catch if we 're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination then we 've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators how they live their lives like the mola and unfortunately they make up a large portion of the california by catch up to twenty six percent of the drift net and in the mediterranean in the they make up up to ninety percent so and how do you do that how do you do that with an animal very few places in the world this is an open ocean creature it knows no boundaries it doesn 't go to land how do you get insight how do you and it 's pictured right here that little tag can upload all and we didn 't even have we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and i think donne wrote and so we figured just one more parasite won 't be too much of a problem and they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment so what are we trying to find out we 're focusing on the pacific we 're tagging on the california coast and we 're tagging over in taiwan and japan and we 're interested in we 'd love to tag in monterey monterey is one of the few places in the world where molas come in large numbers and we 'd love to tag here this is an aerial shot of monterey but unfortunately the molas here the california sea lion takes and you know the locals think it 's terrible behavior it 's just horrible watching this happen day after day the poor little molas coming in getting ripped to shreds so as soon as they get under those rafts of kelp cleaner fish come and they come and give the molas you can see they strike this funny little position that says i 'm not threatening but i need a massage and they 'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head and the fish come up and they just clean clean clean because the scratch me right there you truly can swim up to a mola they 're very gentle and if you approach them right you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it so we 've also tagged one part of the pacific we 've gone over to another part of the pacific and we 've tagged in taiwan and we tagged in japan and everything from the kidney to the to the back bone to the fin muscle to i think that s pretty much the whole fish so the hardest part of tagging now is after you put that tag on you have to wait and you 're just wondering oh i hope the fish is safe i hope i hope it 's going to be able to actually and so the waiting is really the hardest part so it 's totally privy information just for ted and in showing and we found that they kind of are homebodies they 're not big migrators this is their track we deployed the the tag off of tokyo and the mola in one month kind of got into the kuroshio current off of japan and after four months but also what 's important is that they 're not slacker lazy fish they 're super super industrious and this is a day in the life of a mola and if we they 're up and down and up and down and up and down and up and up and down up to forty times a day they start their dive they 've got to come up warm and then plunge back into the depths and go up and down and up and down and they 're hitting a layer down there it 's called the deep scattering layer which a whole variety of food 's in that layer so they 're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through through temperature we see the same pattern now with these tags we 're seeing a similar pattern for for swordfishes manta rays tunas a real three dimensional play this is part of a much larger program called the census of marine life where they 're going to be tagging all over the world and the mola 's going to enter into that and what 's exciting you all travel and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals well now with the census of marine life we 'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore ninety percent of our living space with local knowledge it 's never it 's really never been a more exciting or a vital time to be a biologist"
