  "transcript": "i did something that i regret something that i 'm not but here i feel kind of obliged to reveal in a moment of youthful indiscretion i went to law school law is a professional degree after your university degree you go on i didn 't do very well to put it mildly i didn 't do very well i in fact graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top ninety % possible thank i never practiced law a day in my life i pretty i want to make a dare i say lawyerly case for rethinking how we run our some of you might know it it 's created in one thousand nine hundred and forty five by a psychologist named karl duncker karl duncker he created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science and here 's how it works and i say to you your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn 't drip onto the table now what would you do many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall doesn i saw somebody kind of make the motion over here some people have a great idea where they light the match but it can also have this other function as a platform for the candle the candle problem i want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem done by a scientist named sam glucksberg who is now at princeton university us this shows the power averages for how long it typically takes someone to this sort of problem to the second group he offered rewards he said if you 're in the top of the fastest times you get twenty dollars it 's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work it 's a nice motivator question how much answer it took them on average three and a half minutes right laughter if you want people to perform better you reward them right bonuses what 's interesting about this experiment is that it 's not an aberration this has been replicated over and over and over again for nearly forty years these contingent motivators if you do this then you get that work in some circumstances if you look at the science there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does what 's alarming here is that our business operating system think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses how we motivate people how we apply our human resources but for 21st century tasks that mechanistic he presented the problem in a slightly different way like this up here attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn 't drip onto the table same deal you we 're timing for norms you we 're incentivizing what happened this time the incentivized group kicked the other group 's butt tacks are out of the box it 's pretty easy isn 't it laughter if then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to rewards by their very nature narrow our focus concentrate the mind that 's why they work in so many cases so for tasks like this but for the real candle problem you don 't want to be looking like this let me tell you why this is so that routine work certain kinds of accounting financial analysis computer programming has become fairly easy to outsource fairly easy to automate software can do it faster so what really matters are the are the problems that you face or even the problems we 've been talking about here everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem and for candle problems of any kind in any field those if then around which we 've built so many of our businesses don 't work it makes me crazy i 'm an american i don 't believe in philosophy as we say in my hometown of washington d c a true fact let me give you an example let me marshal the evidence here i 'm not telling a story he and three colleagues did a study large reward if you do really well you get the large reward on down what the better the performance okay same deal a bunch of games three levels of rewards what happens people offered the medium level of rewards they did the worst of all in eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments higher incentives led to worse performance is this some kind of socialist conspiracy going on here no these are economists from mit from carnegie mellon from the university of chicago do you know who sponsored and friedrich hayek and mick jagger we find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does and what worries me as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse is that too many organizations unexamined and rooted more in folklore than in science and if we really want to get out of this economic mess if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century the solution is not to do more of the wrong things to entice people with a sweeter carrot or threaten them with a sharper stick we need a whole new approach it 's built much more around intrinsic motivation around the desire to do things because they matter because we like it they 're interesting mastery the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves i want to talk today only about autonomy somebody invented it it doesn 't mean it 's going to work forever management is great traditional notions of management are great and then giving people lots of autonomy some examples how many of you have heard of the company atlassian it looks like less than half atlassian and they do something incredibly cool a few times a year they tell their engineers go for the next twenty four hours and work on anything you want as long as it 's not part of your regular job work on anything you want engineers use this time to come up with a cool then they present all of the stuff that they 've developed to their teammates to the rest of the company in this wild and woolly all hands meeting at the end of the day being australians everybody has a beer it 's pretty not bad it 's a huge trademark violation but it 's pretty clever famously at google where engineers can spend twenty % of their time working on anything they want and at google as many of you know about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that twenty % time let me give you an even more radical example of it something called the results only work environment in place at a dozen companies around north america meetings in these kinds of environments almost across the board autonomy mastery and purpose the building blocks of a new way of doing things some of you might look at this and say hmm that sounds nice but it 's utopian and i say nope the mid 1990s microsoft started an encyclopedia all the right incentives they paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles well compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time a right do it for fun no one gets paid a cent or a euro or a yen do it because you like to do it gone to an economist anywhere hey i 've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia if they went head to head who would win ten years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet earth this is the titanic battle between these two approaches and who wins in a knockout let me wrap up there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does here is what science knows one those 20th century rewards those motivators we think are a natural part of business do work but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances two those if then rewards but that unseen intrinsic drive the drive to do things for their own sake the drive to do things cause they matter and if we we can solve a lot of those candle problems and maybe maybe maybe i rest my case"
