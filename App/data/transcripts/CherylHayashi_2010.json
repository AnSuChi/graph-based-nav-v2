  "transcript": "'m here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them this red dot marks the great basin of north america 'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle spiders are not just here 's a graph so what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost three hundred and eighty million years this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees a mere seven million years ago most spiders use copious amounts of silk and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction so this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for three hundred it doesn 't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life protective there are many kinds of spider silk for example this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks when you look at this orb web you 're actually seeing many types of silk fibers while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks the filament and the sticky droplet how does an and for those of us spider silk biologists this is what we call the that 's my life we spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider and this is what we see because each spinneret has many spigots on it each of these silk fibers exits from what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland a silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside and i hope you do what you would find is a bounty sometimes thousands these can be grouped into seven and what i have depicted here in this picture let 's start at the one o 'clock position there 's tubuliform silk glands which are used to make the outer silk and the most studied silk line of them all major so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk has duplicated and then diverged specialized over and over and over again to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today there are several features that all these silks have in common they all have a common design such as they 're all very long they 're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins they 're very repetitive and they 're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine this is the kind of sequence that i love looking at day and night and i 've colored in the glycines with and so you can see it 's just a lot of g 's and a 's you can also see that there 's so for example there 's a lot of what we call polyalanines or iterated a 's there 's ggy you can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences at the top of the screen and you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are so this is and you can and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple it 's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body this makes because we 're actually you know testing it in air that 's exactly the environment that spiders are are using so this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing which is basically you know tugging on one end of the fiber very amenable specifically if you look on the vertical axis that 's stress you can see that there 's a lot of variation and in fact dragline or major ampullate silk is the strongest of these fibers needs to be very strong on the other hand if you were to look at strain this is how much a fiber can be extended if you look at the maximum value here again so silk fibers vary in their strength if it wasn 't able to stretch so much then basically when an insect hit the web so if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk there 's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make we call that the tool kit of a spider that 's what the spider has to interact with their environment this is the comparison of the toughness of the what you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph the higher the toughness and i 've colored in yellow the orb web weaving spiders draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus these are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate yet their draglines are not the toughest scytodes doesn 't use instead scytodes sort of lurks that 's how scytodes forages we don 't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline but it 's unexpected results like this now i 'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber bombyx or domesticated silkworm silk it 's the combination of strength extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications for example as a component of artificial tendons and for scaffolds for tissue growth spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti ballistic capabilities silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today in addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks personally i find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself i love when i 'm in the laboratory a new spider silk sequence and that 's why i 'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk pause and look a little closer you 'll be seeing one of the most high performance materials known to man to borrow from the writings of a spider named charlotte silk is terrific"
