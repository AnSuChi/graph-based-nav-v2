  "transcript": "communist regime was moved away the berlin wall came down and one year later the german democratic republic the gdr in the east was unified with the federal republic of germany in the west among many other things germany inherited the archives of the east german secret police only two years after its dissolution to the public and historians such as me started to study these documents to learn more about perhaps you have watched the movie the lives of others this movie made the stasi known as we live in an age where words such as i would like to speak about how the stasi really worked at the beginning let 's have a short look at the history of the stasi because it 's really important for understanding its the russian communists founded the emergency commission for combating shortly cheka it was led by felix the cheka was an instrument of the communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing the cheka was the idol of the stasi officers they called in fact the secret police of russia was the creator and instructor it immediately expanded there and soon it started to train the german communists to build up their own secret police in this hall the ruling party of the gdr was founded five years later the stasi was established and step by step the dirty job of oppression was handed over to it for instance the central jail for political prisoners which was established by the russians at the beginning every important step took place and already the number doubled in each decade this meant that one employee was responsible for one hundred and eighty inhabitants which was really unique in the world at the top of this tremendous apparatus there was one man erich mielke he ruled the ministry of state security for more than thirty years he was a scrupulous functionary in his past he killed two policemen not far away from here who in fact personalized because it united different functions in one organization it used all the imaginable instruments for getting information secretly the stasi was a secret police it could stop people on the street and arrest them in it had the right to open preliminary investigations and to interrogate people officially the stasi had its own armed forces more than eleven thousand soldiers were serving in its so called guards regiment was founded to crash down protests and uprisings the stasi was called a state in the state but let 's look in more and more detail please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented the stasi used all kinds of technical instruments to survey people including the phone of the german chancellor in the west and often also the apartments the stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one this picture you can see me as a young man just in front of this building photographed by a stasi agent the stasi even collected the smell of people it stored samples of it in closed jars which were found after the peaceful revolution for all these tasks specialized departments were responsible the one which was tapping phone calls was completely separated from the one which controlled the letters contrast that but the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of empathy with the object of observation the agent who shadowed me didn 't know who i was or why i was surveyed in fact i smuggled forbidden books from west to east germany but what was even more typical for the stasi was the use of human intelligence people who reported for the minister of state security these so called unofficial employees were the most important tools more than one percent the population because technical instruments can only register what people are doing but agents and spies can also report what people are planning to do and what they are thinking therefore the stasi recruited so many informants the system of how to get them and how to educate them as it was called was where the methods were explored and taught to the officers this guideline gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betray their fellow citizens because a forced informant is a bad informant only someone who wants to give you the information you need the main reasons why people cooperated with the stasi were political political conviction and material benefits the officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the informant the example of the stasi shows that it 's not so difficult to win someone in order to betray others he was the leader of the peaceful revolution and he nearly became the first freely elected prime minister of the gdr until it came out that he was an informant the net of spies was really broad there were many of them i would surely have recognized him his answer was we didn 't send anyone we took those who were around you and in fact two of my best friends reported about me to the stasi in her case it was her husband who spied on her a famous writer was betrayed by his brother this reminds me of the novel the main purpose was to control the society in nearly every speech the stasi minister gave the order to find out who is who which meant who thinks what he didn 't want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime he wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and planning the east germans knew of course that they were surrounded by informers in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust and a state of widespread fear the most important tools to oppress people in any dictatorship why not many east germans tried to fight against the communist regime the stasi often used a method which was really diabolic it was called zersetzung and it 's described in another guideline the word is difficult to translate because it means originally biodegradation but actually it 's a quite accurate description the goal was to destroy secretly the of people for example by damaging their reputation considering this east germany was a very modern dictatorship the it preferred to paralyze them and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions detaining someone was used only as a last resort for this the stasi owned seventeen remand prisons one in every district here the stasi also developed quite modern methods instead he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure in which strict isolation was central nearly no prisoner resisted without giving a testimony if you have the occasion do visit the former stasi prison in berlin and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner who will explain to you how this worked one more question needs to be answered if the stasi were so well organized because these officers were kept busy during the peaceful revolution with only one thing to destroy the documents fortunately they had been stopped by human rights activists that 's why today we can use the files to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state a couple of questions because i have here der spiegel from last week the spies and the informant from east germany so there is a direct link between these two stories or there isn 't what 's your reaction as a historian when you see this hubertus knabe i think there are i think there 's a difference why you are collecting this data are you doing that for protecting your people against terrorist attacks doing that for oppressing your people so that makes a fundamental difference but on the other hand and that is something where we really have to be aware to stop that and that also the intelligence services are respecting the rules we have but nobody speaks about that because nobody could do that last july last the rules are for everybody they are made for everybody so it 's not allowed that any institution doesn 't respect the rules in the criminal code of germany it 's written that it 's not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the so if it 's not respected then and it took a very long time that the public prosecutor of germany started this and he started it only in the case of angela merkel and not in the case of all the other people living in germany because of the story you told seen from the outside i live outside of germany and i expected the germans to react the reaction really came only when chancellor merkel was revealed as being wiretapped why so hk i take it as a good sign because people feel secure in this democracy will be arrested and if you leave this hall after the conference nobody has to be afraid that the secret police is standing out and is arresting you so that 's a good sign i think people are not really scared as they could be the institutions are responsible to stop illegal actions in germany or wherever they happen bg a personal question there has been a debate in germany about granting asylum to edward snowden would you be in favor or against hk oh and if i answer honestly i would give him the asylum because i think it was really brave what he did and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything so i think for these people we should do something and especially where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn 't get it so it would be a good sign to give him"
