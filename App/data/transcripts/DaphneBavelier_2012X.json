  "transcript": "and i 'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter better and faster when we say video games most of you think about children it but when the kids are in bed who is in front of the playstation the average age of a gamer is thirty three years old not eight years old and in fact if we look at the projected demographics of video game play the video game players of tomorrow are older adults it has an amazing impact on our everyday life consider these statistics released by activision after one month of release of the game call of duty black ops it had been played for thousand years so i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games and i 'm almost sure most of you have you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies i 'd like you to put this kind of knee jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku most parents would find that great well i 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health but i 'm going to argue that in reasonable doses actually the very game i showed you at the beginning those action packed shooter games there 's not one week that goes without some major headlines in you 're all bombarded with that and so i 'm going to take a there may be vision scientists among you we actually know how to test that statement we can step into the lab and measure how good your vision guess what guess what their vision is really really good it 's better than those that and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription the other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve imagine you 're driving in a fog and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better clearly when it comes to action video games screen time doesn 't make your eyesight worse we know how to measure attention in the lab i 'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so i 'm going to ask you to participate so you 're going to have to actually play the game right so this is the first example because i introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color how good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict so the young guys here at the top of their game probably like did a little better than some of us that are older what we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games they actually resolve the conflict faster so clearly playing those action games doesn 't lead to attention problems actually those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world this is something we use all the time when you 're driving the running dog and that 's how you can actually be safe driving right we get people to come to the lab sit in front of a computer screen and we give them little tasks that i 'm going to get you to do again you 're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces these are children in the schoolyard in geneva during a recess during the winter it 's actually recess but a few kids are sad and blue because they 've forgotten their coat everybody begins to move around and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn 't so i 'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid it 's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes you can track you can track and then when it stops and there is a question mark and i ask you did this kid have a coat i hear a few yellow good so most of you have a brain i 'm now going to ask you to do the task but now with a little more challenging task there are going to be three of them that are blue keep your eyes fixated and expand pull your attention that 's the only way you can actually do it if you move your eyes you 're doomed yellow or blue audience yellow db good so your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention that 's what we just did your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention which is that 's for you guys we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain and we do find many changes but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention the other one is the frontal lobe which controls how we sustain attention and another one is the anterior cingulate which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict now when we do brain imaging we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action you all have been faulty of multitasking when you 're driving and you pick up your cellphone why because as your attention shifts to your you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you and so you 're much more likely to get we obviously don 't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have that would be a little costly but we design tasks on the computer where we can measure to millisecond accuracy how good they are at switching from one task to another when we do that we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really really good they switch really fast very swiftly they pay a very small cost now i 'd like and put it in the context of another group of technology users a group which is actually much revered by society which are people that engage in that 's a there was a first study done by colleagues at stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high you can 't compare the effect of and the effect of playing action games they have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition perception different video games have a different effect on your brains the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight i showed that to you already like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time those action gamers have a lot what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high so you show them their data you show them they are bad and that 's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain now in a sense when we think about the effect of video games on the brain it 's very similar to the effect of wine on the health there are some very poor uses and at the right age wine can be very good for health there are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater etc and so we need and we 're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them patients we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform i 'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game i can actually change your vision for the better whether you want to play that action game or not right that 's the point of rehabilitation or education most of the kids don 't go to school saying great two hours of math so that 's really so let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation mental rotation is a task where i 'm going to ask you and again you 're going to do the task i want you to tell me which one third one or fourth one okay i 'll help you fourth one one more get those brains third good we then force them to they don 't play ten hours of action games in a row they do distributed practice so little shots of forty minutes several days over a period of two weeks then so this is work from a colleague in toronto what they showed is that initially they actually perform better and why because i told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation we need to have effects that are going to be long lasting now at this point a number of you are probably wondering well what are you waiting for to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has five months after"
