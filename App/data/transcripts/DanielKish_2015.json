  "transcript": "retinal right eye was removed i was thirteen months when they removed my left eye the first thing i did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes the problem it 's impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself think for a moment about your own impressions or the prospect of your own blindness or a loved one going blind the terror is incomprehensible to most of us because blindness is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness hapless exposure how poetic fortunately for me my parents were not poetic they were they understood that ignorance and fear were but matters of the mind and the mind is adaptable they believed that i should grow up to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else in their own words i would move out which i did when i was eighteen i will pay taxes thanks and they knew the difference between love and fear fear immobilizes how do i manage today longer than the canes used by most blind people i call it my freedom staff it will keep me i don 't care to set a new precedent but beyond that many of you may have heard me clicking as i came those are flashes of sound that go out thanks to my parents i call this process flash sonar it is how i have learned to see through my blindness to navigate my journey through the dark unknowns of my own challenges which has earned me the moniker the remarkable batman now batman but i was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable i have always regarded myself much like anyone else who navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges is that so must think that 's remarkable or i wouldn 't be up here but let 's consider this for a moment raise your hands lots of hands going up a moment let me do a head count this will take a while okay lots of hands in the air keep okay anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own so we all face challenges and we all face the but we all have brains that allow us that activate to allow us to navigate the journey through these challenges wouldn 't tell me where the lectern was so you can 't trust those ted folks find it yourself they said so and the feedback for the p a system is no help at all so so if you 'd all close your eyes for just a moment okay and i 'm going to make a sound i 'm going to hold this panel in front of me but i 'm not going to move it just listen to the sound for a moment listen to what happens to that same exact sound when i move the panel you do not know the power of the dark side now keep your eyes closed just say now when you hear the panel start to move okay we 'll relax into this open your eyes all right so just a few centimeters you would notice the difference you 've experienced sonar you 'd all make great blind people let 's have a look at what can happen when this activation see with your eyes and we can see with our ears brian bushway it 's not a matter of enjoying it more or less wouldn 't go back to being sighted jr the bigger the goal the more obstacles you 'll face and on the other side of that goal is victory these people look terrified not so much we have delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly forty countries when blind people learn to see sighted people seem inspired to want to learn to see their way better more clearly with less fear because this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all to navigate any type of challenge through any form of darkness to discoveries unimagined when we are activated i wish you all a most activating journey spectacular standing ovation at ted thank you for an extraordinary talk just one more question about your world your inner world that you construct we think that we have things in our world you as a blind person don 't have but what 's your world like what do you have that we don 't have dk three hundred and sixty degree view it works through surfaces three dimensional geometry one of after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house conversations x ray vision ca what do you picture that you 're from a sonar perspective the size of the room the it 's the height of the room like i say it 's all that kind of three dimensional surface geometry all around me ca well daniel you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way"
