  "transcript": "you may be wondering why a marine biologist from oceana would come here today to talk to you about world hunger i 'm here today because saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire it 's more than a thing we 're doing because we want to create jobs for fishermen or preserve fishermen 's jobs it 's more than an economic pursuit saving the oceans can feed the world let me show you how as you know there are already more than a billion hungry people on this planet and this is a big concern especially considering where we are now we know that we 're headed for climate change which is going to change rainfall patterns causing droughts in our breadbaskets in places like the midwest and central europe and floods and that 's something the oceans have been doing for us for a long time it just seemed like it was continuing to increase until about when we started to see a decline maybe this is peak fish and this is a big problem it 's continuing this red line is continuing to this doesn 't have to be peak fish if we do a few simple things in targeted places we can bring our fisheries back and use them to feed people so let 's look where the fish are it turns out the fish conveniently are located for the most part in our coastal areas of the countries in coastal zones and these are areas that national jurisdictions have control over and they can manage their fisheries in these coastal areas and this is a good thing that they can control their fisheries in these areas because the high seas which are the darker areas on this frustrating tedious process and so controlling things nationally is a great thing to be able to do well you can see here about seven times as many fish in the coastal areas than there are in the high seas so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing because we can actually get a lot done we can restore a lot of our fisheries but so we asked ourselves how many countries do we need to focus on keeping in mind that the european union conveniently manages its fisheries through a common fisheries policy so if we nine other countries how much of our fisheries would we be covering turns out so we think we can work in a limited number of places to make the fisheries come well based on our work in the united states and elsewhere we know that there are three key things we have to do to bring fisheries back and they are we need to set quotas or limits on how much we take we need to reduce bycatch which is the accidental catching and killing of fish that we 're not targeting we need to protect habitats the nursery areas the spawning areas that these fish need to grow and reproduce successfully so that they can rebuild their populations if we do those three things we know the fisheries will come back we know because we 've seen it happening in a lot of different places this is a slide that shows the herring population in norway that was crashing since the was coming down and when norway set limits or quotas on its fishery what happens the fishery comes back when they set the discard limit the fishery came back and it 's not just in norway we 've seen this happening in countries all around the world time so there 's a lot of promise here what does this mean for the world fish catch this means that if we take that fishery catch that 's on the decline and we could turn it upwards we could increase it so we didn 't have peak how many more right about now we can feed about four hundred and fifty million people a fish meal a day based on the current world fish catch which of course you know is going down so that number will go down over time if we don 't fix it but if we put fishery management practices like the ones i 've described in place in ten to twenty five countries we could bring that number up and feed as many as seven hundred million people a year a healthy fish meal but it 's also cost effective it turns out fish is the most protein on the planet if you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all of the other animal proteins and it doesn 't need a lot of fresh water it it also has a very low carbon footprint but it can be a bigger part of our diet which is a good thing because we know that it 's healthy for us it can reduce heart disease and obesity in fact our ceo andy sharpless who is the originator of this concept actually he likes to say fish is the perfect protein andy also talks about the fact that our ocean conservation movement really grew out of the land conservation movement and in land conservation we have this problem where biodiversity is at war with food you have to cut down the biodiverse forest if you want to get the field to grow the corn to feed people with and so there 's a constant push pull there there 's a constant tough decision that has to be made between two very important things maintaining biodiversity and feeding people but in the oceans we don 't have that war in the oceans biodiversity is not at war with abundance in fact they 're aligned when we do things that produce biodiversity and that 's important didn 't anyone get that illegal fishing illegal fishing undermines the type of sustainable fisheries management i 'm talking about it can be when you catch fish using gears that have when you fish in places where you 're not supposed to fish you catch fish that are the wrong size or the wrong species illegal fishing cheats the consumer and it also cheats honest fishermen and it needs to stop the way illegal fish get into our market is through seafood fraud you might have heard about this it 's when fish are labeled as something they 're not think about the last time you had fish what were you eating are you sure that 's what it was because we tested hundred different fish samples and about a third of them were not what they were labeled to be snappers nine out of ten snappers were not snapper fifty nine percent of the tuna we tested seafood has a really complex supply chain and at every step in this supply chain there 's an opportunity unless we have traceability traceability is a way where the seafood industry can track the seafood from the boat to the plate to make sure that the consumer can then find out where their seafood came from this is a really important thing it 's being done by some in the industry but not enough so we 're pushing a law in congress called the safe seafood act and i 'm very excited today to announce the release of a chef 's petition where four hundred and fifty chefs it has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know anthony bourdain mario batali barton seaver and others and they 've signed it because they believe that people have a right to know about what they 're eating fishermen like it too so there 's a good chance we can get the kind of support we need to get this bill through and it comes at a critical time because this is the way we stop and this is the way we make sure that quotas habitat protection and bycatch reductions can do the jobs they can do we know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably we know that we can produce healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people and we need to start now"
