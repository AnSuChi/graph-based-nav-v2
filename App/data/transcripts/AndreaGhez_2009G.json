  "transcript": "because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it not even light so you can 't see it directly and the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist and second it gives us the opportunity and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in well in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object because but in another sense it 's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding and that 's known as the schwarzschild radius it 's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the schwarzschild radius because the size of a sugar cube and it turns out that it 's actually pretty simple to figure out it depends only on the mass of the object bigger objects have i only need and since the mass determines the schwarzschild radius there is actually only one thing i really my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that 's confined to within its schwarzschild so i 'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole i 'm going to talk about supermassive black holes so i wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole an ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star 's life it 's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here and inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the sun on an astronomical scale that 's a very almost every object in that picture and there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left and there are a hundred billion and all the light that we see from a typical galaxy which is the kind of galaxies that we 're seeing here comes from the light from the stars so we see the galaxy because of the star light and we call them active galactic nuclei and we call them that because their nucleus or their are very active so at the center there that 's actually where most of the starlight comes out from and yet what we actually see is light that can 't be explained by the starlight it 's way matter is falling on to so you can 't see the black hole itself but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see so there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies but it 's a kind of indirect it 's given rise to the notion that maybe it 's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes but rather all galaxies might harbor these what we need to assume because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei and what we see is a line of stars because the next closest galaxy is one hundred times further away and as you 'll see in a moment the ability to see detail is key to this experiment so how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume which is the job that i have to show you today stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun it 's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit if there were no massive objects these things would go flying off or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit so this is great so i want to see and that 's the reason that for this experiment we 've used the world 's largest telescope this is the keck observatory it hosts two telescopes with a mirror ten meters which is roughly because the but it turns out these telescopes or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge and that is because but it 's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere pebble on the bottom of the of the stream very much in the same way it 's very difficult to see astronomical sources because of the the atmosphere that 's continuously moving by so i 've spent a lot of my career you 've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot say your you 'd notice or your kids you 'd notice and this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use called adaptive optics you 're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don 't use this technique in other words just a picture that shows the stars and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy where we think with this technology all of a sudden you can see it this technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that 's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you so it 's kind of like although we 've looked at all of them so i want to see how these things have moved and over the course of this experiment these stars have moved a tremendous amount so we 've been doing this experiment for fifteen years and we see the stars go all the way around and to give you a sense of how take five hundred years and as you can see there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle you can see a lot of stars but with this experiment we 've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that 's ten thousand times and because of that we 've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there to give you a sense of how small that size is that 's the size of our solar system so we 're cramming four truth in advertising right i have told you my job is to get it down but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass and in fact it 's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy but any in our universe so what next i actually think what i want to tell you very briefly is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy and the fun phase of this experiment is while we 've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole and that 's the fun let me give you the two examples you can ask what do you expect for the old stars stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time they 've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole what you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole you should see a lot of old stars next to that and what does the big black so in fact my graduate students are at this very moment making observations to get us where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars and so few old stars to make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away to do that we 'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have and what we think we can do and on a much longer and we hope to be able to test some of einstein 's theories of general relativity some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form so we think the future of this experiment is and this means that these things do exist in our universe and we have to contend with this we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world and understand maybe the role in which"
