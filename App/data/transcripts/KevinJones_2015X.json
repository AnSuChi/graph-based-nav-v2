  "transcript": "the very word for many of you conjures unhappy memories of boredom in high school biology or physics class it was the history of what other people had discovered what i 'm most interested in as a scientist is the how of science and then make a prediction that we can test with an experiment or other observation a couple of examples this was first really tested when galileo got his hands on one of the first telescopes and as he gazed into the night sky what he found there was a planet jupiter with he then used those moons to follow the path of jupiter and found that jupiter also was not going around the earth but around the sun sir isaac newton noticed so did we discard gravity gravity pulls things to the earth unless there is an equal and opposite force in the other direction the outliers teach us what we don 't know and lead us hopefully science remains curious enough to look for and humble enough to recognize when we have found teaches us what we don 't actually know we 're going to change gears here for a second the caduceus or the symbol of medicine means a lot of different things to different people but most of our public discourse on medicine really turns it into an engineering problem we have the hallways of congress and the boardrooms of insurance the ethicists and epidemiologists try to figure out how best to distribute medicine and the hospitals and physicians are absolutely obsessed with their protocols and checklists trying to figure out how best to safely apply medicine these are all good things however they also all we start to measure the quality of our health care by how quickly we can access it it doesn 't surprise me that in this climate many of our institutions for the provision of health care start to look a heck of a lot like jiffy lube i didn 't get one of those little doohickeys that your mechanic has to plug into your car and find out exactly what 's wrong with it because the textbook of medicine is not closed and then we make a prediction that we can test now the testing ground of most predictions in medicine is populations and you may remember from therefore in medicine after we make a prediction from a guessed explanation we test it in a population that means that what we know in medicine our knowledge and our from populations sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer it and i would tell you that every one of my patients is an outlier is an exception what we do have as we take a bath in the uncertainty and unknowns and exceptions and outliers that surround us in sarcoma humility and curiosity and i don 't know the answer i 'll ask a colleague who may have a similar albeit distinct patient with sarcoma we it 's through this kind of humbly curious communication that we begin to try and learn new things as an example this is a patient of mine who had a cancer near his knee because of humbly curious communication in international collaborations we have learned that we can repurpose the ankle to serve as the knee when we have he can then wear a prosthetic and run and jump and play and so exceptions and outliers in sometimes the outliers and the exceptions teach us things that matter quite a lot to the general population like a tree standing outside a forest the outliers and the exceptions draw our attention but the tree that stands out by itself makes those relationships that define a tree the relationships between trunk and much more apparent it nonetheless draws our attention i told you that sarcomas are rare they make up about one percent of all cancers you also probably know that cancer is considered a genetic disease by genetic disease we mean that cancer is caused by oncogenes that are turned on in cancer and tumor suppressor genes that are turned off to cause cancer but you 'd be and tumor suppressor genes for the first time in that itty bitty little one percent of cancers called sarcoma harold varmus and mike bishop discovered what that transmissible element was it was a virus the outlier drew our attention and led us to something that taught us very important things about the rest of i told you that sarcoma is rare remember that a one in a million diagnosis if it happens twice in one family the very fact that these are rare draws our attention this is a person this outlier this exception may lead to the advancement of science but this is a person i have conversations with these patients with rare and deadly diseases i write about these conversations these conversations are terribly fraught they 're fraught with horrible phrases like i have bad news or there 's nothing more we can do sometimes these conversations turn on a single word terminal silence can also be rather uncomfortable where the blanks are in medicine can be just as important as the words that we use in these conversations what are the unknowns what are the experiments that being done do this little exercise with me up there on the screen you see this phrase no where notice where the blank is if we move that blank one space over no where just by shifting the blank never forget the night that i walked into one of my patients ' rooms he was a boy i had diagnosed with a bone cancer a few days before but i found his mother reading by flashlight next to his bed she came out in the hall to chat with me for a few minutes it she had memorized it she said dr jones you told me that we don 't always win with this type of cancer but i 've been studying this protocol and i think i can do it i 'm going to quit my job i 'm going to move in with my parents i 'm going to keep my baby safe she was trusting in i didn 't fill in that blank but a year and a half later should i have told her now many of you may say so what i don 't and this is all fine and well but but where the blanks are in medicine i told you that in medicine we test predictions in populations but i didn 't tell you and so often medicine never tells you that every time we 're fine with sometimes we want something different he was concerned about this brimming with confidence he said i got it all and you 're good to go she and her husband were thrilled they went out opened a bottle of champagne the only problem was a few weeks later she started to notice another nodule in the same area it but what happened at this juncture absolutely fascinates me would you mind looking after this patient for me i said why you know the right thing to do as well as i do you haven 't done anything wrong look after this patient for me so i performed a much more invasive surgery and had a very different conversation with the patient afterwards i said most likely this is what i 'm going to watch for and we 're going to work together to find out if this surgery will work but she was now a scientist not only a subject in her experiment and so i encourage you to seek humility and curiosity in your physicians almost twenty billion times each year a person walks into a doctor 's office and that person becomes a patient you or someone you love will be that patient sometime very soon how will you talk to your what will they tell you they cannot tell you but they can tell you when they don 't know join the conversation thank you"
