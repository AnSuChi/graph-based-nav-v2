  "transcript": "years ago my grandfather a young man walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that none other than mae west heartthrob of the ' 30s and he could never forget her in fact when he had his daughter many years later he wanted to name her after mae west but can you imagine an indian child name mae west no way so when my twin brother kaesava was born he decided to tinker with the spelling of keshava he decided to spell or rather misspell raehan with an a e but his love for mae west lives on as a misspelling in the dna of his progeny that for me is legacy you know 200 year plan because you know we both come from families that but we both like to live larger than life i believe in the concept of a raja yogi be a dude well two hundred years we calculated is at the end of our direct contact with the world there 's nobody i 'll meet in my life will ever live beyond two hundred years you know i never really believed in legacy what am i going to leave behind i 'm an artist a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week now i 'm in the business of creating art and i think about what i want to leave behind through those paintings the nine eleven cartoon upset me so much perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings most important things in my 200 year plan that netra and i write insecurities and our 200 year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire we actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems i am going to expire my fear of my leftist feminist mother in law and this today is the date laughs she 's watching i really make decisions all the time about how i want to remember myself and that 's the most important kind of decisions i make youtube name it i 'm on it it 's so easy to think of technology and if technology is not a metaphor for memory what is it netra and i use our technology as a tool in our and i 've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my facebook page and i actually untagged myself first then i picked up the phone i said mom you will never put a picture of me in a bikini whether you agree with you know legacy or not we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time so netra and i really wanted to use our and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future how you may ask i never see myself moving forward in time i actually see time moving backward towards me i can dodge what i don 't want and pull in what i want i actually imagine and i see whether they 're feeling it from their gut are they feeling it from their heart or is it just a cerebral thing and it really informs my even when i do an art show i really think about what should people walk away with i could imagine people coming in dressed up looking beautiful my paintings with all the light and in my visualization i actually saw a very famous who was that i couldn 't tell if it was shabana azmi or rekha two very famous indian actresses like the meryl streeps of india and we can curate not only the future but also the past this is a picture of my family and that is netra my wife she 's the co creator of my you live in the past while i 'll create the future and when i 'm done you can study about it and you are sitting in it and i 'm grading you she started by giving students pakistan from britain and i said wow then she asked them to separate fact from bias as an imaging tool and she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn 't have if this is so it occurred to me that maybe just maybe the primary objective of our brains netra and i don 't write for someone else to come and execute it in one hundred and fifty years imagine receiving a parcel saying you know i used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy education is great it really teaches us who we are and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world but it 's really my creativity that 's taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am i 'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have it lets us create who we are and curate what is to come i like to think thank you i like to think of myself as a storyteller where my past my future waiting to be told and retold i hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own 200 year story thank you so much"
