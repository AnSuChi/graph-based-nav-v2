  "transcript": "his inaugural address barack obama appealed follow in the footsteps of invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things and he appealed it seems a little out of place in a cutting edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising how many things there are but it 's not surprising what they are but the one thing i want you to notice about them is this even though this is a very long list there isn 't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one and yet when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered mike who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because jones was out of his bed and charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor 's admonition and didn 't vacuum the visitor 's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap and then there was luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man 's room twice from nurses and if we 're lucky now and then from doctors doesn 't just make people feel a little now not all janitors are like this but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings will to do right by other people and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as luke did when he re washed the floor but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people perhaps most important a wise wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you 're serving you need permission to be allowed to improvise try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures when you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones i described how hard it is to learn to do and they don 't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people it 's scary you a little story it 's a story about lemonade a dad and his seven year old son were watching a detroit tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was mike 's hard lemonade which was five percent alcohol being an academic had no idea that mike 's hard lemonade so he brought it back and the kid was drinking it and a security guard spotted it and called the police who called an ambulance that rushed to the whisked the kid to the hospital the emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood but not so fast the wayne county child welfare protection agency said no and the child was sent to a foster home for three days at that point after two weeks i 'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure but they spare you from thinking and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is better ones more of them after all is there the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic it 's preposterous on its face but they create a downward downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations and moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing the lemonade story is one second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern american education scripted curricula here 's an example from chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say items in this script to teach a 25 page picture book we know why these scripts are there we don 't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster but what they assure in its place is mediocrity don 't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you 're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting and they make people less likely to do it i 'll just give you one example because time is racing in switzerland back years ago they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community they knew it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks ' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it 's my responsibility and i 'm getting paid what happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking what is my responsibility all we ask is what serves my interests when ceos ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains that will lead to massive bonuses but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word barack obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just ' is it profitable ' but ' is it right ' and when professions are demoralized everyone in them becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in medicine we ought to try to work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you 're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about atticus but we learn that with sophistication comes celebrate them and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too that 's one thing we can do i don 't know how many of why because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them maybe on paper our company is worth less to wall street but i can tell you it 's worth more we 're doing fine just at this ted we heard talks from several moral heroes two were particularly inspiring to me one was ray anderson who turned and a bonus he 's discovering is he 's actually going to make even more money yesterday we heard willie smits talk about i 'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the are behind you this will fail and there isn 't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on bill gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that kipp is doing to take inner city kids and turn them in the direction of college they need to learn to respect their they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning the way you teach these things to the kids obama appealed to virtue and i think he was right courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right i think people want to be allowed to be virtuous it 's what ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly thank you very much"
