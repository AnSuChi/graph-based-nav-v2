  "transcript": "i woke up in the middle of the night i do not remember what time it was i just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking everything in my room was shaking everything i looked out the windows and i saw a full i thought it was just like the movies but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that i was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray and a full circle of explosion and i kept and i secretly thanked god that that missile did not land on my family 's home and i still feel guilty about that prayer for the next day i learned that that missile landed on my brother 's friend 's home and killed him and his father but did not kill his mother or his sister his mother showed up the next week at my brother 's classroom and begged kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son for she had lost this is not a story of a nameless survivor of war and nameless refugees whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv dirty face scared eyes this is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war who we do not know their hopes their dreams their accomplishments i i am another image and vision i am that refugee and i am but there 's another side i grew up with the colors of war the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile so bright i grew up with the sounds of war these are the sounds you would expect but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night the high pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous iraq and founded a group called women for women international that ends up working with women survivors of wars in my travels and in my work from congo but the fears of and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid it is very scary to go through that feeling of i am about to die or i could die in this explosion but there 's also the fear of losing loved ones and i think too painful you don 't want to think about it but i think the fear of losing the ' i that 's what my mother in iraq used to tell me it 's like dying from a palestinian woman once told me it is not about the fear of one death she said sometimes i feel i die ten times she said but it 's not fair and there should only be one death we have been drawdown timelines surges and sting operations when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage we have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics tactics weapons dollars and this is the language of sterility how casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic this is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children of modern war casualties hundreds of thousands of congolese women are getting raped and mutilated how interesting these just become numbers that we refer to the front of wars is increasingly non human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist it is a chess game we are missing my mother 's story who made sure with every siren with every raid we are missing the story of fareeda a music teacher a piano teacher in sarajevo who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in sarajevo and walked despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her and kept with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats missing the story of nehia a palestinian woman in gaza who the minute there was we are missing the stories of violet who despite surviving genocide in the church we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars do you know do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going and the ones who are keeping that life are women and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open and there is a side that is there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting and there is a side that is led by women and in order for us we must have a full picture of what that means in order for us to understand what actually we need to understand as one sudanese woman once told me is the fact that my toenails are growing back again where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees many women were taken as slaves by rebels and as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers so that woman walked for twenty years so she would not be kidnapped again we need to understand peace from a toenail 's perspective i find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping and the group of people who are mostly though not exclusively who are keeping life going in the midst of war are not included in the students the men who refuse to pick up the guns they are too excluded from the negotiating tables there is no way we can talk about a lasting peace building of democracy not one but fifty percent there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we we don 't start investing in women and girls did you know that one year of the world 's military spending equals seven hundred years of the u n budget and equals two thousand nine hundred and twenty eight years of the u n budget allocated for women perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world last but not least we need to invest in peace and women not only because it is the right thing to do but it is for the future a congolese woman who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them and her children saw their nine year old sibling killed in front of them she got into women for women international 's program she got a support network she learned about her rights we taught her vocational and business skills we helped her get a job she was earning four hundred and fifty dollars she was doing okay she was sending them to school have a new home and when they want to grow up they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother we need to invest in women because that 's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future that mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do and if they can who are we not to dance that girl that i told you about ended up starting women for women international group that impacted one million people sent eighty million dollars and i started this from zero nothing nada [ unclear ] think of how the world can be a much better place both from the you there ideas language even the phrase ' each other ' no longer makes any sense i humbly add humbly add that out beyond the worlds of war and peace there and there are many women and men [ who ] are meeting there let us all thank you"
