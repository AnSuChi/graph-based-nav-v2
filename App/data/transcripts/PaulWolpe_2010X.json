  "transcript": "talk about design but not design as we usually think about it we have the power to design bodies to design animal bodies to design human bodies in the history of the first wave of evolution is what we think of as darwinian evolution so as you all know species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments and the pressures of those environments selected which changes through random mutation in species were going to be preserved we altered our ecological niche by creating civilization and that has been the second great couple one hundred thousand years one hundred and fifty thousand years flow of our evolution we have changed our own evolution now we 're entering a third great wave of which has been called many things intentional evolution evolution by design very different than intelligent design so i want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications because of this change now we actually have been doing it for a long time we started selectively breeding animals many many and if you think of dogs for example this is a beefalo a beefalo is a this is a geep a and they are now using these in certain cultures this is the largest cat in the world the it 's bigger than a but and so one of the things we 've been doing is using genetic enhancement and if that were all this was about then it would be an interesting thing but something much much more powerful is happening now these are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep sea jellyfish we all know that some these are normal cells and what you see here is these cells so they did it with mouse pups they did it with monkeys and if you can do it with monkeys though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes they can do it in monkeys they can probably figure out how to do it in apes which means they can do it in human beings it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark and in fact right these are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to and they are actually available now in certain states other states have banned them nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures there is no area of the government not the and so some states have decided to allow them some states have decided to ban them some of you may have read about the fda 's consideration right now of salmon the salmon on top is a genetically engineered chinook salmon using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat make it grow much faster using a lot less feed the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has ralph the rat the first cloned rat cc the cat for cloned cat snuppy the first cloned dog snuppy for seoul national university puppy created in south korea by the very same man that some of you may remember the first cloned horse it 's a haflinger horse cloned in italy a real gold ring of cloning because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings but if you can clone that horse you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud alexis janie and dotcom we 've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species this is the use of now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create so with antithrombin in that goat that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that gtc genetics wants to create knockout pigs from the national institute of animal science in south korea are pigs that they are going to use in fact to try to create all instead of producing them in an industrial way the guar is an endangered southeast asian ungulate gestated in the ovum of a cow and then that cow gave birth to a guar same thing happened with the mouflon where it 's an endangered species of sheep it was gestated in a regular sheep but we but a guar with cow mitochondria and therefore cow mitochondrial dna and a mouflon with another species of sheep 's mitochondrial dna these are really hybrids not pure animals and it raises the question of how we 're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology a question that we 're not really sure yet and what they 've done here is they 've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain they can send this creature around the lab it gets worse than that or perhaps better than that this actually is one of darpa 's very important darpa is the defense research agency one of their projects these and they can fly these creatures around the lab they can make them go left right they can make them take off they can 't actually make them land they put them about one inch above the ground and then they shut everything off and they go pfft but and in fact this technology has gotten so developed that this creature this is a moth this is the moth in in its pupa stage and that 's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth it is already prewired the wires are already in its body and they and now they 've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance they can put little cameras on them and perhaps it 's got technology it 's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres it 's got a camera on top of its head the scientists can make this creature they have it running through mazes controlling where it 's going they 've now created an organic the graduate students in sanjiv talwar 's lab said is this ethical we 've taken away the autonomy of this animal i 'll get back to that in a minute there 's also been work done with monkeys this is miguel nicolelis of duke he took owl monkeys wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they they then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm which you see here in the picture put the arm in another room pretty soon the computer learned by reading the monkey 's brainwaves to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey 's arm did then he put a video monitor in the monkey 's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm and the monkey got fascinated the monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm this prosthetic arm would do and eventually she was moving it and moving it and eventually stopped moving her right arm and staring at the screen could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms this is thomas demarse at the university of florida he took twenty thousand and then sixty thousand disaggregated rat neurons so these are just individual neurons from rats so now we have organic computer chips made out of living eel brain this is a brain from a lamprey eel it is living attached photosensitive sensors to the brain put it into a cart when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart the cart moves toward so now we have a complete living sitting there in its nutrient medium but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding this is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts he altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with where he took a cell took a dna synthesizer which is a machine created an artificial genome put it in a different cell the genome was not of the cell he put it in and that cell then reproduced as the other cell and so asks the economist the first artificial organism and its consequences so you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that and here at the bottom are just bottles of a t c and g the four chemicals that make up our dna chain and it confers on us a responsibility is everything okay is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want do we have free reign to design the body of a retriever maybe some pink fur and let 's make it glow in the dark does industry get to create creatures who in their milk in their blood and in their saliva and other bodily fluids create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines and then the final step of this once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then 's already happening it 's not science fiction we are not only already using these things in animals some of them we 're already beginning to use on our own bodies we are directly designing the future of the species of this planet it confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now it is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future"
