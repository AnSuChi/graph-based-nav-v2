  "transcript": "i want you to imagine this for a moment rahul and rajiv living in the same neighborhood rahul is offered but rajiv is sent home even in the the most obvious example is suicide it might surprise some of you here as it did me when i discovered that suicide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people but beyond the impact of a health condition on life expectancy we 're also concerned about the quality of life lived now which stands for a we discover that for example mental illnesses are amongst the leading causes of disability around the world depression for example is the of disability alongside conditions such diarrhea and pneumonia in children but beyond the world health organization estimates that there are nearly four to five hundred million people living on and i 'm pretty sure that each and every one us present here today can think of at least one person what 's truly important from a global health point of view what 's truly worrying from a global health point of view we do have robust evidence that a range of and social interventions can make a vast difference and yet an astonishing ninety percent the chances are but perhaps most heartbreaking of all are the stories even in the very institutions that were built to care for people with mental illnesses the mental hospitals it 's this injustice that has really driven my mission to try to do a little bit and a particularly critical action that i focused on is to bridge the gulf between the knowledge we have that can transform lives the knowledge of effective treatments and how we actually use that knowledge and an especially important challenge that i 've had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals such as psychiatrists and psychologists particularly in now i trained in medicine in india any case i went on i soldiered on with psychiatry and found myself training in britain in some of the best hospitals in this country i was very privileged i worked in a team of incredibly this was a reality of a world in which there were almost no mental health professionals at all in zimbabwe for example there were just about a dozen psychiatrists most of whom lived and worked in harare a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the countryside take a guess the actual number is about three thousand about two i had to think out of the box about some other model of care and in these books i discovered the idea of task shifting in global health the idea is actually quite simple the idea is when you 're short of specialized health care professionals use whoever is available in the community diagnose and treat early pneumonia to great effect and it struck me that if you could train ordinary people to deliver such complex health care interventions then perhaps they could also do the same with mental health care well today i 'm very pleased to report to you and i want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments all three of which focused on depression the most common of all mental illnesses demonstrated that they could deliver interpersonal psychotherapy for depression and using a randomized control design showed that ninety percent of the people receiving this intervention recovered as compared to roughly forty percent in atif rahman and his colleagues showed that lady health visitors who are community maternal health workers in pakistan 's health care system could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers who were depressed again showing dramatic differences in the recovery rates roughly seventy five percent of mothers recovered as compared to about forty five percent in the leading to seventy percent recovery rates as compared to fifty percent in the comparison primary health centers i have coined this particular acronym sundar what sundar stands for in hindi is attractive it seems to me that there are five key lessons that i 've shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting the first is that we need to simplify the message that we 're using stripping away all the jargon that medicine has invented around itself we need to unpack complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less trained individuals we need to reallocate the few specialists who are task shifting is an idea with truly global significance because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries i think it has why is that because health care in the developed world the health care costs in the [ developed ] world are rapidly spiraling out of control but equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it 's become very remote and removed from local communities what 's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting though isn 't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering it empowers ordinary people indeed for me task shifting is the ultimate example of the democratization of medical knowledge and therefore medical power just over thirty years ago the nations of the world assembled at alma ata and made this iconic declaration i think all of you can guess that twelve years on we 're still nowhere near that goal in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregivers it is for this reason that some years ago the movement for global mental health was founded as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals like myself and receive the care that we know can transform their lives"
