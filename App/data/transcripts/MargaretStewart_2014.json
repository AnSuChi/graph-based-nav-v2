  "transcript": "what do you think of when i say the word design you probably think of things like this finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things classic icons of timeless design but i 'm not here to talk about that kind of design i want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket i 'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically consider the fact that google processes over one billion search queries every day and facebook transmitting the photos messages and stories of over one point two three billion people that 's almost half of the internet population and a sixth of humanity but what is really hard about designing at scale is this it 's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things audacity and humility audacity to believe that the thing that you 're making is something that the entire world wants and needs there 's no school that offers the course designing for humanity one hundred and one and today i 'd like share some of the things that we 've learned over the years now the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter here 's a really good example of how a very the team at facebook that manages the facebook like button decided that it needed to be redesigned the button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand and it needed to be modernized now you might think well it 's a tiny little button it probably is a pretty straightforward turns out there were all kinds of constraints for the design of this button you had to work within specific height and width parameters you had to be careful to make it work in a bunch of different languages and be careful about using fancy gradients or borders because it has to degrade gracefully in old web browsers the truth is designing this tiny little button was a huge now this is the new version of the button and the designer who led this project estimates that he spent over two hundred and eighty hours redesigning this button why would we spend so much time on something so small it 's because when you 're designing at scale there 's no such thing as a small detail this innocent little button is seen on it 's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created now when you 're working let me give you an example so that you can understand what i mean only a small percentage were let 's say my friend laura hypothetically uploads a picture of me from a drunken night of karaoke you know how some people are kind of worried that their boss or employee is going to discover embarrassing photos of them on facebook do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at facebook and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch he really thought there was something else going on and he was now this was a scenario which i didn 't even actually know existed until this research happened and they found something really interesting so i report it and i say i 'm in this photo and i don 't like it and i select it 's embarrassing now the team found that this relatively small change had a huge impact before only twenty percent of people were sending the message and now sixty percent were and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result that same survey showed that ninety percent of your friends want to know if they 've done something to upset you now i don 't but we also rely very heavily sometimes the designers who work on these products are called data driven which is a term that totally drives us bonkers but data analytics will never be a substitute for design intuition data can help you but it will never made a bad design good now i often have joked that i spend almost as much time designing the introduction of change as i do the change itself and i 'm sure that we can all relate to that when something that we use a lot changes and then we have to adjust the fact is people can become very efficient at using bad design it 's still incredibly frustrating when it happens and this is particularly true with user generated content platforms because people can rightfully claim a sense of and it was interesting because when we looked into the data we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five star rating so we decided to simplify into an kind of voting binary model it 's going to be much easier for people to engage with but video creators really loved their ratings millions and millions of people were accustomed to the old design so in order to help people prepare themselves for change and acclimate to the new design we actually published the data graph sharing with the community the rationale for what we were going to do and it even engaged the larger industry in a conversation which resulted in my favorite techcrunch headline of all time its ratings are useless it 's impossible to completely avoid change aversion when you 're making changes to products that so many people use even though we tried to do all the right things and it 's because these products this work really really matters to them now you have to understand who you are and you start to engage in that goal in earnest at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you 're living in but what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity what if you had no access to public libraries what if your country had no free press what would these products start to mean to you and it 's what they 'll look like to most of the next five billion people to come online designing for low end cell you have to design for where people are and not where you are so how do we keep this big big picture in mind we try to travel outside of our bubble to see hear and understand the people we 're designing for we use our products it means difficult and sometimes exasperating work to try to improve and evolve products and the humility part it 's a little tough on the design ego because these products are always changing"
