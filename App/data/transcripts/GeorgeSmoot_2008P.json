  "transcript": "and so i have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and and then following it up and trying to understand it and so you see this space that 's created how did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped and so forth how did the universe begin and shape what was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it this is a star everything else is a galaxy ok so there 's there 's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here and when i look out at particularly this galaxy which looks a lot like ours i wonder if an art design college conference going on and because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky we think there 's on the order visible to the hubble space telescope if you had the time to scan it around about one hundred billion galaxies right it 's a very large number of galaxies so the question should come to your mind is what kind of design you know what kind and that 's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big we draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it and the moon is only two seconds away so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light it 's the moon two seconds ago and who cares two seconds is like the present the sun is eight minutes ago that 's not such a big deal right unless there 's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way you 'd like to have it 's a problem you hear about mars it 's a problem communicating to mars because it it takes light long enough to go there but you go and look to the center if you took a picture of the earth two million years ago there 'd be no evidence of humans at all because we don 't think there were humans yet i mean it just gives you the scale but if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further there 's some things even further and that was what i did in a lot of my work was to develop the techniques back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different and so that 's the sort of sequence and so i have a more artistic impression of this there 's the galaxy in the middle which is the milky way the beginning of time is funny and the universe gets that way and you can see that but there are these very tiny variations which and from them in the time sequence we 're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced so it 's a big design job so there was the cobe satellite the and later this year this is the cool stealth version the one that that actually has some beautiful design features to it and that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe and what we saw both about the structure of space time and about the contents of the universe and about how so we have this picture which is quite a spectacular picture and i 'll come back to the beginning where we 're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the and they evolve into galaxies and then later they get to the so let me show you some of nature 's patterns that are the result of this i always think of as being the real substance of space and the galaxies and the stars just so here is the sloan digital sky survey showing the location identify what are stars and throw them away look at the galaxies estimate how far away they are and plot them up and just put radially they 're going out that way and you see these structures this thing we call the great wall but there are voids and those kinds of stuff now i 'm going to show you this in 3d what happens is you take pictures as the earth rotates you get a fan across the or because there are no fan like and you see this thing we call the great and you see these voids there are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together there 's another survey which is very similar to this called the two degree field of view now we 're going to fly through it it at warp a million which we do because there 's a redshift measurement and everything and when you 're in the middle of the galaxies it 's hard to see the pattern it 's like being in the middle of life it 's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience it 's hard to see the pattern of this so we 're going to go out and swing around and look back at this first the structure of the survey and then you 'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there and you say well how did this happen how are you going to do that what 's the kind of technique what 's the kind of thing you 're going to do so i 'm going to show you the results of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like using essentially some of the play principles and some of the design principles that that you know humans have labored so hard you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules and realize a whole bunch of different representations so what i 'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales we 're going to zoom in but this is a and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right it 's called dark matter that is matter that doesn 't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does the way the light 's shining on me or on the that is the dark matter it should be called invisible matter but the dark matter we 've made visible so this we 're going to zoom in notice this pattern we 're going to zoom in and zoom in and you 'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids and when so we live in we don 't live in the center of the solar system we don 't live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy 's not in the center of the cluster so we 're zooming in this is a region which probably has more than one hundred thousand and so i forgot to tell you the scale a so it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance now we 're into a distance sort of between now we 're going to zoom back out and you can see this this structure that when we get very far out looks very regular but it 's made up of a lot of irregular there 's a very simple fluid to begin with it 's got dark matter it 's got it 's got photons and it 's got neutrinos which don 't play much role and so you know when you first saw this picture didn 't mean quite so much to you here you 're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you 're seeing billions of galaxies right so let 's fly through it and you can see how much harder it is when you 're in the middle of something to figure this out so here 's that same end result you see a filament you see the light is the invisible matter and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up and we 're going to fly around and we 'll fly around and you 'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect and you get a large cluster of galaxies it 's only when you look at you realize it 's a very intricate complicated kind of a design right and it 's grown up in so the question is how hard would it be to assemble this right how big a contractor team would you need to put this universe therefore making this this supercluster of galaxies and you have to understand this is not how it would actually look if you first you can 't travel this fast everything would be distorted but this is using simple rendering and this is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to you you could see invisible matter too and how would you put together the universe in a very simple way we 're going to start and realize it started with tiny and then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies so i 'm going to show you a smaller simulation this simulation was run on one thousand processors for a month in order to make this simple visible one so i 'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days and you start seeing these networks this cosmic web and this is a simple one because it doesn 't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter and you see how the dark matter lumps up and the ordinary matter just trails along behind the fluctuations are a part in one hundred thousand there pulls the material around in that pulls in more material and pulls in more material but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time and it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now in terms of its expansion and at that point the universe and then but this is two days so we have an idea of how to play seriously creating the universe by starting with and we create everything we can see in any direction right from something extremely tiny extremely small and it which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see that is galaxies and so we have a model and that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations and actually fluctuations on several scales and on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the earth what kind of a map we would have got of the earth you can see well you can kind of pick out all the major continents but that 's about"
