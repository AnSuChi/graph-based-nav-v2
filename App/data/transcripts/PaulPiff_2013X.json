  "transcript": "talent and luck that helped earn you success in games as in life has been rendered irrelevant because this game 's been rigged and you 've got the upper hand you 've got more money and as you think about that experience i want you to ask yourself how might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game change the way you think about yourself and regard that other player and with the flip of a coin randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game they got two times as much money and they got to roll both dice instead of one so they got to move around the board a lot more and over the course of fifteen minutes we watched through hidden cameras what happened what i want to do today for the first time is show you a little bit of what we saw so we 've provided subtitles so it was quickly apparent to players that something was up and yet as the game unfolded we saw very notable differences dramatic differences begin to emerge between the two players the rich player started to move around the board louder literally smacking the board with the piece as he went around we were more likely to see signs of dominance and nonverbal signs displays of power and celebration among the rich players we had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side it 's on the bottom right corner that allowed us to watch participants one even asks like you just saw is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick despite that the power of the situation seems to inevitably the game went on one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns that we observed begin to emerge was that the rich players actually started to become ruder toward the other person and more and more demonstrative of their material success more likely to showcase how well they 're doing and when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of monopoly they talked about what they 'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game and they became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation including that flip of a coin that had randomly now this game of monopoly can be used as a metaphor for understanding society wherein some have a lot of wealth and a lot of status and a lot of people don 't they have a lot less wealth and and what my colleagues and i for the last seven years have been doing is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies what we 've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country is that as a person 's levels of wealth increase their feelings of and their feelings of entitlement of deservingness and their ideology of and that the pursuit of now what i want to do today is talk about some of the implications of this ideology self interest talk about why we should care about those implications and end with what might be done some of the first studies that we ran in this area looked at helping behavior something social psychologists call pro social behavior and we were really interested in who 's more likely to offer help to another person we told the participants they could keep these ten dollars for themselves or they could share a portion of it if they wanted to with a stranger who 's totally anonymous they 'll never meet that stranger the stranger and we just monitor how much people give we 've had people play games in one of the games we actually rigged a computer so that die rolls over a certain score people would be inclined to take candy from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified as being reserved for children not kidding i know it sounds like i 'm making a joke we explicitly told participants this candy is for children participating in a developmental lab nearby they 're in studies this is for them we 've even studied cars not just any cars but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk now in california as you all know because i 'm sure we all do this it 's the law to stop for a pedestrian who 's waiting to cross so here 's an example of how we did it that 's our confederate off to the left posing as a pedestrian he approaches as the red truck successfully stops in typical california fashion driving through and a bmw doing the same so we did this for hundreds of vehicles on several days just tracking who stops and who doesn 't what we found was as the of a car increased none of the cars none of the cars in our least expensive car category broke the law close to fifty percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category now i don 't mean to suggest that it 's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior not at all in fact i think that struggle with these competing motivations of when or if to put our own interests above the interests of other people and that 's understandable because the american dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper as long as we apply ourselves and work hard and a piece of that means that sometimes you need to put your own interests above the interests and well being of other people around you but what we 're finding is that the wealthier you are the more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success of achievement and accomplishment to the detriment of others around you here i 've plotted for you the mean household income received by each fifth and top five percent of the population over the last twenty years the differences between the different quintiles of the population in terms of income are fairly egregious but over the last twenty years that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else in fact the top twenty percent of our population own close to ninety percent of the total wealth in this country we 're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality what that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select group of individuals but the american dream is becoming increasingly unattainable for an increasing majority of us and if it 's the case as we 've been finding that the wealthier you are the more entitled you feel to that wealth and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests above the interests of other people and be willing to do things to serve that there 's no reason to think that those patterns will change and that 's what it would look like if things just stayed the same at the same linear rate now inequality economic inequality is something we should all be concerned about and not just because of those at the bottom not just the people at the bottom there 's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world showcasing the range of things that are undermined things we really care about physical health social trust all go down as negative things in social collectives and societies exacerbated but that resound across all strata of society even people at the top experience these outcomes so what do we do this cascade of certainly nothing we as individuals could do we 've been finding in our own laboratory research small nudges in certain directions can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy for instance reminding people of the benefits of cooperation or the advantages of community cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people in one study we had people watch a brief seconds long about childhood poverty and after watching that we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time an hour later rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person a stranger someone who 's poor bill gates one of our nation 's wealthiest individuals in his harvard commencement speech talked about the problem of inequality facing society as being the most daunting challenge and talked about what must be done to combat it saying humanity 's greatest advances are not in its discoveries but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity and there 's the giving pledge in which more than one hundred of our nation 's wealthiest individuals and there 's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements like we are the one percent resource generation or wealth for common good in which the most privileged members of the population members of the one percent and elsewhere people who are wealthy are adults and youth alike that 's what 's most striking to me leveraging their own privilege their own economic resources to combat inequality by advocating for social policies changes in social values and changes in people 's behavior that work against their own economic interests but that may restore the american dream thank you"
