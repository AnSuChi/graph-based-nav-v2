  "transcript": "i have a confession to make i am addicted to adventure and as a young boy i would rather look outside the window at the birds in where time stands still and even sometimes dies my teachers thought there was something wrong with me because i wasn 't paying attention in class but they didn 't test to me is about our connection with the world with the universe it but until we can go there i think the oceans still hold if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is we need to build a log cabin if you will at the bottom of the sea and so there was a great curiosity in my soul when i went to go visit a ted [ prize winner ] by the name of dr sylvia earle maybe she was staked out at the last undersea marine laboratory to try and save it to try and petition for us not to scrap it we 've only had about a dozen or so scientific labs at the bottom of the sea there 's only one left in the world it 's nine miles offshore and aquarius in some fashion is a dinosaur an ancient robot chained to the bottom this leviathan and so with that visit i realized that my time is short if i wanted to experience what it was like to become an aquanaut swam towards this after many moons of torture and two years of preparation this habitat waiting to invite us was like a new home it wasn 't about at something the size of a school bus it was about giving us the luxury of time outside to wander to explore to understand more about this oceanic final frontier we had megafauna come and visit us this spotted eagle ray is a fairly common sight in the oceans why this picture is up is because this particular animal brought his friends around and instead of being the pelagic animals that they were they started getting curious about us these new doing things with plankton and because of the luxury of time these animals these residents of the coral reef were starting to get used to us and these pelagics that normal travel through stopped full days during our mission it was about that human ocean connection because of the luxury of time we were able to study animals such as sharks and grouper in aggregations that we 've never seen before it 's like seeing dogs and cats behaving well together even being able to commune with animals that are much larger than us such as this endangered goliath grouper after a while if they get tired the goliath grouper barks at us and this bark is so powerful that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all within a split second now and again because of the luxury of time we were able to do over three years of science in thirty one days in this particular case we were using a pam or let me just see if i can get this straight a pulse and from northeastern were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do when we 're not around gauges the fluorescence of corals we used all sorts of other cutting edge tools such as this sonde or what i like to call the the sponge or the redwoods of the [ ocean ] and this gives us a much better gauge of what 's happening underwater with regard to climate and finally we looked at predator prey behavior and predator prey behavior is an interesting thing because as we take away some of the predators on these coral reefs around the world the prey or the forage fish act very differently darting in grabbing a little bit of algae and going back into their homes they start spreading out and disappearing from those particular coral reefs well within that thirty one days we were able to generate over ten scientific papers on each one of these topics but the point of adventure is not only to and with that thanks to a couple of engineers at mit we were able to and that particular camera gives us an insight into what fairly common animals do but we can 't even see it in the blink of an eye let me show you a quick video of what this camera can see the silky bubble come out of our hard hats it gives us an insight into some of the animals that we were sitting right next to for thirty one days and never normally would have paid attention to cordon it back to the lab and actually man the trigger from the lab itself but what this gives us is the foresight to look at and analyze in scientific and engineering terms some of the most amazing behavior that the human eye just can 't pick up such as this manta shrimp impossible but now we can see things such as these christmas tree worms pulling in and fanning out in a way that the eye just can 't capture or in this case a fish throwing up grains of sand and if you look at it in real time it actually doesn 't even show its fanning motion because it 's so quick one of the most precious gifts that we had underwater is that we had wifi days straight we were able to connect with the world in real time from the bottom of the sea and share all of these experiences quite literally right there i am skyping in the classroom with one of the six continents and some of the seventy thousand students that we connected every single day to some of these experiences as a matter of fact i 'm showing a picture that i took with my smartphone from underwater and maybe just maybe if we push the boundaries of adventure and we share that knowledge with others out there we can solve all sorts of problems my grandfather used to say people protect what they love my father how can people protect what they don 't understand and i 've thought about this my whole life and we all need to have an adventure and whether it 's about climate change or eradicating poverty or giving back to future generations thank you very much"
