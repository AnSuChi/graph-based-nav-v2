  "transcript": "when i was a young officer they told me to follow my instincts to go with my gut and what i 've learned is that often our instincts are wrong in the summer of two thousand and ten there was a massive it shook up the american government and it made people ask a lot of questions because the sheer amount of information that was let out and the potential impacts were significant and one of the first questions we asked ourselves was why would a young soldier have access to that much information why would we let sensitive things be with a relatively young person and our specified mission and we focused on fighting a war that was unconventional and it was difficult and it was bloody and it often claimed its highest price among innocent people we did everything we could to stop al qaeda and the foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers and as accelerants to the violence we took small boats we drove and we walked to objectives night after night to to stop the killing that this network was putting forward and we killed to stop that organization from the violence that they were putting largely against the iraqi people how we had grown up and one of the things that we knew that was in our dna was secrecy it was security and we had a sense that as we operated within our organizations it was important to keep information in the silos within the organizations particularly only give information to people had a demonstrated need to know but the question often came who needed to know who needed who had to have the information so that they could do the important parts of the job that you needed and in a tightly coupled world that 's very hard to predict it 's very hard to know who needs to have information and who doesn 't i used to deal with intelligence if i knew that we wouldn 't have a problem we had to change from who needs to know to the fact that who doesn 't know and we need to tell and tell them as quickly as we can it was a significant culture shift for an organization and in the summer of two thousand and seven something happened which demonstrated this we captured the personnel records and when we got the but as i was talking to my intelligence officer i said what do we do but as we passed that information around suddenly you find that information is only of value if you give it to people who have the ability to do something with it the fact that i know something has zero value if i 'm not the person who can actually make something better because of it so as a consequence what we did was we changed the idea it was the because in your somebody 's going to get my college grades out a that 's going to be a disaster and i will tell you that i am more scared thank i don 't know if you were here this morning if you were able to catch rick ledgett the deputy director of the nsa who was responding to edward snowden 's talk earlier this week i just wonder do you think the american government should give edward snowden amnesty"
