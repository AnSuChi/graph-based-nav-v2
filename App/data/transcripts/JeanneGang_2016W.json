  "transcript": "i 'm a relationship builder when you think of a relationship builder don 't you just automatically think architect probably not that 's because most people think architects design buildings climate change together with political and economic troubles are having an impact they 're adding up and stressing out cities and us the people who live in them and it 's actually this balance this web of life that sustains life my team and i have been applying insights from ecology to architecture the projects i 'm going to show you today use the idea of building relationships as the key driver for design we were asked to design a center for social justice they asked us for a building that could break down traditional barriers between different groups and in doing so create possibilities for meaningful conversations around social justice they thought a place for preparing food together could do that and they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community they thought a fireplace could draw people in and help start conversations everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world so we looked around the globe and found examples of community meeting houses community meeting houses are places the low roof keeps everybody seated and at equal eye you can 't stand up and take over the meeting you 'd actually bump your head so we designed a space just like that right in the middle of the arcus center and we anchored it with a fireplace and a kitchen it and now the central space works for big social gatherings it 's almost like this three way intersection that encourages bumping into people and starting a conversation you can study together in big groups or in small ones because the architecture sets up these opportunities and it 's good for the planet but is it working is it creating relationships and nurturing them how can we know well more and more people are coming here for one and as a result of the fireside chats and a full calendar of programming people are applying for the arcus fellowships in fact it 's working so i 've shown how architecture can connect people on this kind of horizontal campus scale upward in tall buildings you might only see people in those awkward elevator rides i 've been designing tall buildings it 's a residential high rise in chicago aimed at young urban professionals and empty nesters many of them new to the city with over seven hundred apartments we wanted to see if we could use architecture to help people get to know their neighbors even when their homes are organized in the vertical dimension the shapes of the floor slabs vary slightly and they transition as you go up the tower the result of this is that you can actually see people from your balcony the balconies are misregistered you can lean over your balcony and say hey just like you would across the backyard to make the balconies more comfortable for so the effect of the balcony shapes breaks up the wind and confuses the wind and makes the balconies more comfortable and less windy you can be connected to the outdoors and people are starting to meet each other on the building surface and we 've heard laughter they 've even starting getting together as couples but besides romantic relationships the building has a positive social effect on the community as evidenced by people starting groups together and starting big and why is it important public architecture is just not as successful if it comes from the top down and they built this identical model all over the city the communities didn 't feel invested in the process or feel a sense of ownership of these buildings it was equality in the sense that everybody gets the same police station but it wasn 't equity in the sense you know in my field but i believe that we need architecture and every tool in our tool kit to improve but my team and i wondered if so we reached out to community members and police officers in north lawndale it 's a neighborhood in chicago where the police station is perceived as a scary fortress surrounded by a parking lot lot it 's based on the idea that if you can increase opportunities for positive social interactions between police and community members instead of the police station as a scary fortress you get highly active spaces on the public side of the station that spark conversation like a barbershop a coffee shop both cops and kids said they love sports these insights came directly from the community members and the police officers themselves and as designers our role was just to we were able to raise funds and design and but is it rebuilding trust the but now they even have basketballs inside the station that kids can borrow and recently they 've asked us to expand the courts and build a park on the site you might be able to drop in for a haircut at the barbershop or reserve the community room for a birthday party or renew your driver 's license or get money out of an atm it can be a place for neighbors to meet each other and to get to know the officers and vice versa libraries but reimagining the buildings for the future is going to require engaging the people who live there engaging the public can be intimidating and i 've felt that too but maybe that 's because in architecture school we don 't really learn how to engage the public in the act of design but i think that can change so if we can focus the design mind on creating positive reinforcing relationships in architecture and through architecture i believe we can reduce the stress and the polarization in our urban habitats we can help steady this planet we all share see architects really are relationship builders"
