  "transcript": "is what my last week looked like what i did who i was with or if i could have just but clearly from this visualization you can learn much more about me than from this other one pie charts for the quality of your sleep the path of your morning runs in my day job i work with data and we design and develop ways to make information accessible through visual representations sometimes we actually have to forget about them and see through them instead but let me step back for a moment to when i first understood this personally in i was too young to be interested in politics and i remember the feeling very vividly it was a complete surprise as my dad promised that in my town he knew nobody who voted for him this was the first time when the data i had gave me a completely distorted image of reality my data sample was actually pretty limited and skewed so probably it was because of that i thought i lived in a bubble and i didn 't have enough chances to see outside of it now fast forward to it looked like we had enough information this time and many more chances to see outside the closed circle we lived in but we clearly didn 't the feeling felt very familiar i had been there before we believed even with the most respected newspaper is that the obsession to reduce everything to two simple percentage numbers to make a powerful headline made us focus on these two digits and them alone stories stories of human beings behind these numbers in a different context but to a very similar point a peculiar challenge was presented to my team by this woman she came to us with a lot of data but ultimately she wanted to tell one of the most humane stories possible she 's samantha cristoforetti she has been the first italian woman astronaut and she contacted us before being on a six month long expedition to the international space station and i want to do something meaningful with the data of my mission to reach out to people a mission to the international space station comes with terabytes of data about anything you can possibly imagine the orbits around earth we had all of the hard data we could think of just like the pundits before the election but what is the point of all these numbers and that you can actually see her with your naked eye on a clear night we designed and developed what we called friends in space a web application that simply lets you say hello to samantha from where you are and hello online at the same time from all over the world and all of these hellos left visible marks on the map as samantha was flying by and as she was actually waving back every day at us using twitter from the iss this made people see the mission 's data from a very different perspective it all suddenly became much more about our human nature and our curiosity rather than technology the very positive response of its thousands of users taught me a very important lesson that working with data means designing ways to transform the abstract and the uncountable into something that can be seen felt and directly reconnected to we can remove technology completely stefanie posavec a london based designer who shares with me the passion and obsession about data we didn 't know each other but we decided and we opted for using no technology whatsoever to share our data in fact our only means of communication would be through the old fashioned post office we used our personal data to get to know each other personal data around weekly shared personal information that we would then manually hand draw on a postcard size sheet of paper that we would every week send from london to new york where i live and from new york to london where she lives the front of the postcard is the data drawing the very first week into the project we actually chose a pretty cold and impersonal topic how many times do we check the time in a week so here is the front of my card and you can see that every the different types of symbols indicate why i was checking the time what was i doing was i bored was i hungry was i late did i check it on purpose and this is the key part representing the details of my days and my personality through my data collection stefanie and i spent one year collecting our data manually to force us to focus on the nuances that computers cannot gather or at least not yet using data also to explore our minds and the words we use and not only our activities where we tracked the thank yous we said and were received and when i realized that i thank mostly people that i don 't know apparently i 'm a compulsive thanker to waitresses but i definitely don 't thank enough the people who are close to me the process of actively noticing and counting these types of actions became a ritual it actually changed adding the contexts of our very personal stories to them but i 'm asking you to consider data all kind of data as the beginning of the conversation and not the end while the real stories what we missed looking at these stories only through models and algorithms is what i call data humanism european intellectuals placed the human nature instead of god at the center of their view of the world i believe something similar needs to happen with the universe of data now data are apparently treated like a god keeper of infallible truth for our present and our future the experiences that i shared with you today taught me that to make data faithfully representative of our human nature and to make sure they will imperfection and human qualities in how we collect process and display them i do see a place where ultimately instead of using data only to become more efficient we will all use data to become more humane"
