  "transcript": "i 'm going to present three projects in rapid fire i don 't have much time to do it and i want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation the first is what i like to call a hyper rational process it 's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call sort of a rational conclusion to something and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn 't expect as being the result of rationality the second the second this is something that has editing and it has teams but in fact we no longer see within this process the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out connect all these things high modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic almost anything can happen within them i call turn your head this way shoot and you 're bound to kill something so this is the promise of high modernism within a single space actually any kind of activity can happen but as we 're seeing operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters and so with this sort of idea what happens is whatever actually is in the building on opening day or whatever seems to be the most immediate need starts to and so we 're proposing a different kind of flexibility something that we call compartmentalized flexibility and the idea is that you within that continuum identify a series of points and you design specifically to them they can be pushed off center a little bit but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped with high modernist that doesn 't really work now i 'm going to talk about i 'm going to build up the seattle central library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams and i truly mean this is the design process that you 'll see with the library staff and the library board we settled on two core positions this is the first one and this is showing over the last nine hundred years the evolution of the this diagram was our sort of position piece about the book and our position was books are technology that 's something people forget but it 's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media the second premise and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first is that libraries since the inception of carnegie library tradition in america had a second responsibility and that was for social roles but something actually the librarians at first said no this isn 't our mandate our mandate is media and particularly the book so what you 're seeing now is actually the design of the building the upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility sort of any activity could happen anywhere and what we saw were buildings that were very generic and worse not only were they very generic so not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it and in this simply compartmentalize put those things whose evolution we could predict and i don 't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future so that was the core idea important to media in order to get them to accept this what you 're seeing here is actually their program on the left that 's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory but only one third of your own program is dedicated to media and of it is already dedicated that 's the white band below the thing you said isn 't important is already dedicated to social functions and then we started making new decisions what you 're seeing on the right is the design of the library specifically in terms of square footage on the left of that diagram so that literally was the design of the building they signed it and to their chagrin we came back a week later and we presented them this and as you can see it is literally the diagram on the right we just sized no really i mean those are the boxes we sized them into five compartments they 're super efficient we had a very low budget to work with we pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships the reading room should be able to see the water so you see the five platforms those are the boxes within each one a very discrete the area in between is sort of an urban continuum these things that we can 't predict their evolution to the same degree to give you some sense of the power of this idea the biggest block block is what we call the book spiral it 's literally built in a very inexpensive way it is a parking garage for books it just so happens to be on the and it allows us to organize the entire dewey decimal system on one continuous run no matter how it grows it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we 've all experienced in public libraries and so this was the final operation which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter and to hold onto them with a skin that skin serves double duty again for economics is the lateral stability for the entire building it 's a structural element but its dimensions were designed not only for structure but also for holding on every piece of glass the glass was then i 'll use the word impregnated but it had a layer of metal that was called stretched metal that metal acts as a microlouver so from the exterior of the building the sun sees it as totally opaque but from the interior it 's entirely transparent so now i 'm going to take you on a tour of the building let me see if i can find it for anyone who gets motion the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego and it was defended believe it or not by the librarians they said look we don 't know what it is but we know it 's everything that we need it to be based on the observations that we 've done about the program is so now we 're going into what we call the living room this is actually a program that we invented with the library it was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space there are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in but there are not so many now we 're moving up into what we call you 'll have to tell me if i 'm going too fast for you and now up this is actually the place that we put into the building so i could propose to my wife i can very quickly get into the book spiral because i think it 's as i said the most this is the main reading room you dizzy yet ok so here this is the book spiral one city block go up one full floor so that it 's on a continuum ok now i 'm going to go back and i 'm going to hit a second project i 'm going to go very very quickly through this now this is the dallas theater it was an unusual client for us because they came to us and they said but because of that temporary space we 've become an infamous theater chicago and seattle with the exception of the dallas theater company so it was a very daunting task for us to do a and the second is they were what we call a multi form theater they do different kinds of performances in repertory so they in the morning will do something in arena then they 'll do something in proscenium and so forth and so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations and for operational budget reasons this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi form theater in the united states so we needed to figure out a way so our thought was to literally put the theater on its head to take those things that were previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them above house and below house and to create what we called a theater machine we invest the money in the operation of the building it 's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere wherever you place it the area under it is charged for theatrical performances allowed us to go back to first principles and redefine fly tower acoustic enclosure light enclosure and so forth it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium thrust and in fact arena and traverse and flat floor in a very quick transfiguration so in fact using operational budget we can sorry capital cost we can actually achieve what the artistic director now has the intermission in a greek procession second act in arena and so forth any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely the light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure so you can do beckett with dallas as the backdrop portions can be opened so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance or you can even just have an open air performance or for intermissions the proscenium line can also disappear you can bring enormous objects in so in fact the dallas theater company their first show will be a play about charles lindbergh and and then it also provides them in the off season the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things this is it from a distance this is a monster truck show i 'm going to show now the last this also is an unusual client they inverted the whole idea of development they came to us and they said unlike normal developers they said we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville that 's our main goal and so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money they saw and the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma so they worked in and that pro forma led us to a mixed use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within and it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of this is louisville 's skyline and i 'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project and there 's a levee behind our site similar to the ones that broke in new orleans a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites so we 're starting to build a sort of and there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings and a view corridor because this is the historic district that they didn 't want to obstruct with a new building and now we 're going to add one one million square feet and if we did the traditional thing that one point one million square feet place them on sites and now we 'd have a really terrible situation a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods and we create something that was unviable in fact and you know this this is called the time warner building reposition them so that 's the basic concept and now i 'm going to show you what it leads to ok it seems a very formal willful gesture but something derived entirely out of the constraints and again when we unveiled it there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems now within that center zone as i said we have the they told us the dimensions the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all the public components the lobbies the bars everything that different commercial elements would have and combined it in the center so it creates a situation like this where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the it allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art and so forth it also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool so they 're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary so how it 's a chair so we begin by building the cores as that allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency this is not a high budget building we finish the art museum we put all the mechanical equipment in it and then we jack it up into the air this is how they build really large aircraft hangars for instance the ones that they did for the a380 finish the meat and you get something that looks like this now i only have about thirty seconds so i want to start an animation and we 'll conclude with that thank you chris asked me to add and finish in two thousand and ten"
