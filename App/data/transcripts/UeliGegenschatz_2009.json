  "transcript": "i started with paragliding paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider with the possibility to fly cross country distance just with the use of thermals to soar also different aerobatic maneuvers are four people flying together and on the left hand side it 's the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump for the film itself and also for the judging from regular relative skydiving skydiving i went on to freeflying freeflying is more the stand up position carving around the whole formation freefall also with the helmet cam to film this jump from freeflying i went on to skysurfing skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet you can imagine with this big a skysurfing board there is a lot of force a lot of power of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning we call it i can make it fly and as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface with a proper body position i 'm able to really move forward to quite some distance this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro you can see the copacabana on the left hand side from there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving i went on to base jumping base jumping is skydiving from fixed objects earth meaning mountains cliffs it 's for sure for me it 's the ultimate feeling of so my goal soon was to so in summer two thousand i was the first to base jump the eiger north face in switzerland two years after this i was the first to base jump from matterhorn a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here three very famous mountains in switzerland the special thing on these i hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day in two thousand and eight i jumped the eiffel tower in paris so with all this this knowledge i also so with some friends we started to do different tricks like for example this jump here i jumped from a paraglider or here everybody ready to slide down with my or this jump from a moving truck on the highway extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step if you really work hard on your skills of course you need to and probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills mental preparation and all this so for two thousand and nine i 'm training hard for my two new projects the first one i want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit and i want to set a new record with the longest distance ever flown so now on the and thank you very much the the i think we all might have some questions so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does because it it looks like it might ueli gegenschatz pretty much i believe this is probably the closest the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly i would say impact it 's but people are trying are you among those you 're not going to commit are you among those trying to do it ue it 's a dream it 's a dream yeah we 're still working on it and we 're developing the wingsuits to and what is the there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing that 's reason number one and reason number two it 's much easier for the camera guy to film if i 'm using smoke jc ah i see so the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked one more question what do you do to to cover your face because i just keep keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards are you in a helmet feeling would be with only goggles jc and is that how you usually fly ue usually i 'm wearing a helmet in the mountains i 'm always wearing a helmet because of landings usually it 's difficult it 's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings so you have to be prepared jc right now is there anything you don 't do do people come to you with projects and say"
