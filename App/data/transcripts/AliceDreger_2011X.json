  "transcript": "i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of on the exact same day at the exact same moment each conceiving a baby ok so two couples each conceiving one baby now i don 't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception because both take off we so i wear two hats in most of what i do and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy meaning the other hat that i 've worn in my work is as an activist as a patient advocate say as an impatient advocate for people who are patients of doctors so some of what i 've worked on for example is people who are conjoined twins two people within one body some of what i 've worked on is people who have dwarfism so people who are much shorter than typical and a lot of what i 've worked on is people who have atypical sex and as a general term we can use the term intersex for this so in one instance you can have somebody who has an xy but because this she is raised as a girl and it 's often not until she hits puberty and she 's growing and developing breasts now what 's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male but they 're really not and the adrenal glands make androgens which are a masculinizing hormone most females like me i believe myself to be a typical female i don 't actually know my chromosomal make up but i think i 'm probably typical most females like me are actually and we 're responding to androgens the consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens so sex is really complicated it 's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum in some ways they can be all over the place another example a few years ago i got a call from a man who was nineteen years old and had just found out that what he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia and in the womb his adrenal glands were in such high gear and as a consequence his genitals were masculinized his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones and he was born looking like a boy nobody suspected ok so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex which is when you have ovarian tissue with the reason that children with these kinds of bodies whether it 's dwarfism or it 's conjoined twinning or it 's an intersex type are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health in many cases people are actually perfectly healthy the reason they 're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity what it means to be a black person is allegedly to have an african anatomy in terms of your history and when we 're faced with a body that actually presents us and our nation 's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body where i ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when south african runner caster semenya had her sex called into question at the international games in berlin i had a lot of journalists calling me asking me which is the test they 're going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female and i had to explain to the journalists there isn 't such a test in fact we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories and it 's not just in terms of sex it 's also in terms of race turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed ninety five percent of our dna with chimpanzees and as we get farther and farther with our science we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge in our culture in the united states today is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human such that it has a different right than a fetal life nowadays probably not out in the open as much as within medicine about the question of when somebody 's dead in the past our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead at most they 'd stick a feather on somebody 's nose and if it twitched they didn 't bury them yet if it stopped twitching understanding that these but they were great i mean they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that cheesy musical one thousand seven hundred and seventy six every few years and it 's not because of the music which is totally forgettable it 's because of what happened in and this is why what they rejected what our founding fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of but they did have a concept of birthright they had a concept of blue blood they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth the founding fathers rejected that idea and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept and that concept was was all men are created equal they leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy not the difference and that was democracy growing up but it was also science growing up at the same time and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world they were moving away from supernatural explanations and if you look for example in the declaration of independence they talk about nature and nature 's god they don 't talk about god and god 's nature they 're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are so as part of that they were coming to us with a concept so what happened years afterwards what happened was women for example who wanted the right to vote took the founding fathers ' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said the fact that we have a uterus and like sojourner truth talking about ain 't i a woman we find men on the the marching lines of the civil rights movement saying i am a man again people of color appealing to we see the same thing with the disability rights movement of course that as we begin to look at all that commonality we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning so let 's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk so she 's born henry by contrast is born at term so he 's born on march that mary was born prematurely three months she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than henry does henry by virtue of being assumed to be male although i haven 't told you that he 's the xy one but mary can only marry today in a few states and the question to me becomes what do we do as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that 's been based on anatomy i don 't want to give up the but at the same time it feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us so where do we go it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude we have to draw the line somewhere so we will draw the line somewhere texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don 't have a y chromosome and what it means to marry a woman means you have a y chromosome in practice they don 't test people for their chromosomes but this is also very bizarre because of the story i told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome but on the content of their character moving beyond i also want to point out that i 'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans because i have to admit that there are some golden retrievers i know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans i know i also want to say there are probably also some yellow labradors that i know that are more capable of mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40 year olds that i know so how do we operationalize what if content of character turns out to be something that 's scannable in the future able to be seen with an fmri do we really want to go there what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead we don 't have a situation that iran has for example where a man who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them partly to make a name for himself but when i was on the phone with him asking why he 'll do this surgery this was a very high risk surgery his answer was that in this other nation these children were going to be treated very badly and so he had to do this my response to him was well have you considered political asylum instead instead of a separation so i think we have to be in the lead and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies particularly when we have people thinking in groups but on average are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and so if we think about that we have an interesting situation in hands years ago when i was in graduate school one of my graduate advisors who knew i was interested in feminism i considered myself a feminist as i still do asked a really strange question he said tell me what 's feminine about and i thought well that 's the dumbest question i 've ever heard feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender so there 's nothing feminine about feminism but the more i thought about his question the more i thought there might be something feminine about feminism that is to say there might be something on average different about female brains from male brains us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state it 's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept what we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect but how to care for each other and maybe that 's where we need to go in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy is to think less about the so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union we 're thinking about what we do for each other"
