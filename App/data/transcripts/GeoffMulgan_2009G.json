  "transcript": "to believe that it 's less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance the credit which drives our economies froze the payback perhaps for years of vampire predators like bernie madoff whom we saw earlier and it 's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat and we 're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone where no one quite knows what 's worked or what doesn 't we don 't have any we don 't know which experts to believe anymore what i 'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what i think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis what things we should be looking out for there 's a definition of leadership which says it 's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect and i want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis which is by no means small really is used to the full i want to start just by saying a bit about where i 'm coming from i 've got a very confused background which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times i 've got a ph d in telecoms as you can see i trained briefly as a buddhist monk under this guy i and i 've been in charge of policy for this guy as well but what i want to talk about begins when i was at this city this university as a student beautiful people many of whom took to heart ronald reagan 's comment that even if they say hard work doesn 't do you any harm why risk it but when i was here a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation leaving school at time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment and they were people who were not short of of wit or grace or energy but they had no hope no jobs no prospects and when people 't allowed to be useful they soon think that they 're useless and although that was great for the music business at the time it wasn 't much good for anything else and ever since then i 've wondered why it is that capitalism now since that time we 've actually been through an extraordinary boom the longest boom ever in the history of this country unprecedented wealth and prosperity but that growth hasn 't always delivered what we needed h l mencken once said that to every complex problem there is a simple solution and it 's wrong but i 'm not saying growth is wrong but it 's very striking that throughout the years of growth many things didn 't get better rates of carried on up right across the western world if you look at america the proportion of americans with no one to talk to about important things went up from a tenth to a quarter we commuted longer to work but as you can see from this graph the longer you commute the less happy you 're likely to be and it became ever clearer that economic growth doesn 't automatically translate into social growth or human growth we 've got to do whatever we can to help them but we 've also got to ask i think a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind and i think one of the lessons of history is that even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity and you saw that in the ' 30s when great depression paved the way for bretton woods welfare states and i think you can see around us now some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow you can see it in daily life omsk turning barges into temporary farms and i 'm very small part of this i have sixty thousand of these things in my garden a few of these this is atilla the hen but about things which matter to and everywhere too you can see a proliferation of time banks and parallel currencies people using smart technologies to link up all the resources freed up by the market and i 'm here to help but i think last year when governments did step in people were quite glad that they were there that they did act because it 's already clear how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy really went into fixing the past bailing out the banks the car companies not preparing us for the and everywhere as people think about the unprecedented we should be using this with a longer term vision to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs to civil society for people able to create the new not clunky government programs fish don 't overdo it rather than change what we consume like the mayor of so paulo who 's banned advertising billboards or the many cities like san francisco putting in infrastructures for electric cars you can see a bit of the same thing happening in in the business world some i think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing but ask yourselves what will be the biggest sectors of the economy in ten twenty thirty years time it won 't be the ones lining up for handouts like cars and aerospace and so on the biggest sector by far will be health already eighteen percent of the american economy predicted to grow to thirty even forty percent by care child care already much bigger employers than cars education six seven eight percent of the economy and growing environmental services energy services the myriad of green jobs they 're all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn 't just about products but is using distributed networks and it 's founded above all on care on relationships on what people do to other people we know go back to where we were before that we 'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city how to care for a much older population how to and here 's the problem in science we do experiments systematically our societies now spend four percent of gdp to invest systematically in new discovery in science in technology to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this it 's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago maybe they are but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did and what 's striking though is that in society there 's almost nothing comparable no comparable investment no systematic experiment in the things capitalism isn 't very good at like compassion or empathy or relationships or care now i didn 't really understand that until i met this guy who was then an 80 year old slightly shambolic man who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated he had helped shape britain 's post war but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur became an inventor of many many different the university of the third age which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people as well as strange things like diy garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs and he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer and his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers not from a theory not doing things at people for them but i think it 's rapidly becoming quite 's what we do in the organization named after him where we try and invent create launch new ventures whether it 's schools web companies health organizations and so on and we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation using ideas from design or technology or community organizing to develop the germs of a future world but through practice and through demonstration and not through theory they 're spreading from korea to brazil to india to the usa and across and they 've been given new momentum by the crisis by the need for better answers to joblessness community breakdown and so on some of the ideas are strange these are complaints choirs people come together to sing about the things that really bug them others are much more pragmatic health coaches learning mentors job clubs and some are quite structural like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime or helping and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress president obama what if we put let 's say one percent of public perhaps we 'd achieve similar productivity gains in perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition stopping trafficking why don 't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today 's citizens now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade but only with radical and but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too now i want to end by saying a little bit about what i think this means for capitalism i think what this is all about this whole movement which is growing from the margins remains quite small nothing like the resources of a cern or a darpa or an ibm or a dupont us is that capitalism is going to become more social it and social care and in industries where the value but it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the dna of restless continual innovation into society trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work now i think this future will be quite surprising to many people in recent years a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won history was over and society would inevitably have to take second but i 've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy just after the french revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in france we were naturally we needed hierarchy only now it 's individualism inquisitiveness and so on even fidel castro now says that the only thing worse than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism and whereas then monarchies palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident today it 's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city i 'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost though that might be quite tempting the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end and it 's going to steadily move to the sides the margins of our society transformed from being a master into a servant a servant to the productive economy and of human needs will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism which is that unlike what you read in economics textbooks it 's not a self sufficient system and our human nature isn 't just it 's also compassionate it 's not just competitive it 's i think we are at a moment of choice the crisis is almost certainly deepening around us it will be worse at the end of this year quite possibly worse in a year 's time than it is today but this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we 're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for or whether this is a moment to jump ahead to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway"
