  "transcript": "i 'm driven by pure passion to create photographs that tell stories photography can be described as the recording of a single moment frozen within a fraction of but what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph what if a photograph could actually collapse time compressing the best moments of the day and the night seamlessly into one single image i know it has for me photographing for anywhere from fifteen to thirty hours and i then choose the best moments of the day and night visualizing our conscious journey with time i can take you to paris and i can show you the early morning rowers along the river seine i am essentially a street photographer from fifty feet in the air and every single thing you see in this photograph actually happened on this day i 'm fascinated by the concept of going to a place like venice and actually seeing it during a specific event and i decided i wanted to see the historical regata an event that 's actually been taking place since the boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then and an important element that i really want you guys to understand is this is not a timelapse this is me photographing throughout the day i am a relentless collector of magical moments the entire concept came about in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six life magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph of the cast and crew of baz luhrmann 's i noticed there was a mirror on the wall and i saw they were actually reflecting in it for that one moment that one image i asked them would you guys just kiss for this one picture and i hand glued these two hundred and fifty images together i 'm changing time in a photograph and that concept actually stayed with me for thirteen years until technology finally has caught up to my this is an image i created of the santa monica pier day to night and i 'm going to show you a little video that gives you an idea of what it 's like being with me when i do these pictures and i 'm usually in a cherry picker or a crane so this is a typical capturing the entire day unfold this is the greatest seat in the house to have but this is really how i go about creating these photographs so once i decide on my view and what i call the time vector the time vector changes sometimes i am exploring the space time continuum within a two dimensional still photograph now when i when i do these pictures it 's literally like a real time puzzle going on in my mind this can take us several months to complete the fun thing about this work is so i never know who 's going to be in the picture if it 's going to be a great sunrise or sunset no control it 's at the end of the process if i 've had a really great day and everything remained the same that i then decide who 's in and who 's out and it 's all based on time i 'll take those best moments that i pick over a month of editing and they get seamlessly creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds painting has always been a really important influence in all my work he inspired a recent series that i did on the national parks this is capturing the stars and the moonlight as it the best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed from day into night and when that sun started to bierstadt 's exact same lighting one hundred years earlier day to night is it 's about color it 's about he takes his oath and now he 's speaking to the there 's so many challenging aspects when i create photographs like this for this particular photograph i was in a 50 foot scissor lift up in the air and it was not very stable so every time my assistant and i shifted our weight our horizon line shifted so for every picture you see and there were about one thousand eight hundred in this picture we both had to tape our feet into position every time i clicked the shutter i think the two most important are patience and the power of observation i discovered that those people in cars that i sort of live with everyday they don 't look like people in cars anymore they feel like a giant school of fish it was a i think this photograph begins to really capture that when you look closer in my work you can see there 's stories going on so i decided in this photograph i would checkerboard time so wherever the shadows are it 's night and wherever the sun is time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around but in a very unique and special way i believe these photographs begin to put a face on time they embody a new metaphysical visual reality when you spend fifteen hours looking at a place this was a perfect example i call it i watched over fifteen hours all these people not even look at sacr coeur they were more interested in using it as a backdrop they would walk up i found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is versus what the human experience is evolving into the act of sharing has suddenly become more important than the experience itself and finally my most recent image i went specifically during the peak migration to hopefully capture the most diverse range of of animals unfortunately when we got there there was a drought going on during the peak migration were drawn to the water i found this one watering hole and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving i had a real opportunity to capture something unique we spent three days studying it i photographed for twenty six hours in a sealed crocodile blind eighteen feet in the air what i was unimaginable frankly it was biblical we saw for twenty six hours all these competitive species share a single resource called water the same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over during the next fifty years the animals never even grunted at each other they seem to understand something that we humans don 't 't that this precious resource called water is something we all have to share when i i realized that day to night is really a new way of seeing compressing time exploring the space time continuum within a as technology evolves but they will compose a new narrative thank you"
