  "transcript": "newspapers are dying for a few reasons so it 's enough to bury any industry rather ask can anything save newspapers there are several scenarios for the future newspaper some people say it should be free it should be tabloid or even smaller a4 it should be local run by communities or niche for some smaller groups like business but then it 's not free it 's very expensive it should be sounds nice but this can only buy time because in the long run i think there is no reason no practical reason for newspapers to survive so what can we do twenty years ago they were run by an inexperienced staff with no visual culture no budgets for visuals in many places there were not even art directors i decided to be before i was an architect and my grandmother asked me once what are you doing for a living i said i 'm designing newspapers what there 's nothing to design there it 's just boring letters and i had a revelation i thought these guys took some creepy and put it to the highest possible level of performance art i thought oh my god maybe i can do the same with these boring newspapers and i did we started to redesign them one by one the front page became our signature it was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers i 'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation my approach i wanted i wanted to make posters not newspapers not even magazines posters we were experimenting with and we had fun soon it started to bring results our pages were named covers of the year three times in other examples you can see here are from latvia lithuania estonia the central european countries but it 's not only about the front page the secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece as one composition like music and music has a rhythm has ups and downs and i 'm responsible for this experience we treated two pages both spreads as a one page because that 's how readers perceive it you can see some russian pages here which got many awards on biggest infographic competition in spain but they name it 's best designed newspaper and two years later the same award came to estonia what really makes it amazing that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too just some examples in russia plus eleven after one year plus twenty nine after three years of the redesign up to thirty five percent did design do this design was just a part of the process and the process we made was not about changing the look it was about improving the product completely and then usually after two months we start designing my bosses in the beginning were very surprised why am i asking all of these business questions instead of just showing them pages so what is the lesson behind it it can even change you give power to designers but the second is even more important you can live in a small poor country like me you can work for a small company you can have no budgets no people but still can put your work to the highest possible level and everybody can do it you just need inspiration vision and determination and you need to remember that to be good"
