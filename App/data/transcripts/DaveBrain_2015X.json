  "transcript": "because that would be a little weird and by here i don 't mean here but life all life on earth from complex to single celled from mold to mushrooms to flying bears laughter the interesting thing is earth is the only place we know of that has life we 've looked other places maybe not as hard as we should or we could but we 've looked and haven 't found any earth is the only place we know of with life this is a question i 've wanted to know the answer to since i was a small child and i suspect eighty percent of this auditorium has thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer to understand whether there are any planets out there in our solar system or beyond that can support life the first step is to understand what life here requires it turns out of all of those eight point seven million species life only needs three things but life deep underground can get its energy from things like chemical reactions there are a number of different energy sources available on all planets on the other side all life needs food and this seems like a tall order especially if you want a succulent tomato however all life on earth derives its nourishment from only six chemical elements and these elements can be found on any planetary body in our solar system so that leaves the thing in the middle but water water and not water in a gaseous state and so we don 't look there and so it 's hard to access it 's hard to get to it 's hard to even find out if there 's any life there so let 's make the problem simpler for ourselves let 's think only about and in order of distance from the sun it 's venus earth and mars you want to have an atmosphere for water to be liquid you have to be very careful with that atmosphere you can 't have too much atmosphere too thick or too warm an atmosphere because then you end up too hot it 's a i 'd like to remind you number one if mama bear 's bowl is too cold does that mean it 's always been too cold or could it have been just right at some other time when goldilocks walks into the room and atmospheres do the same so let me give you an example here 's one of my favorite pictures of mars it 's not the highest resolution image it 's not the sexiest image riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years to form this one image tells you that the atmosphere of mars and it changed from a state that we would define as habitable because the three requirements for life were present long ago where did that atmosphere go that allowed water to be liquid at the surface well one idea is it escaped away to space atmospheric particles got enough energy to break free from the gravity of the so we can explain this transition how do atmospheres get their energy for escape how do particles get enough energy to escape there are two ways if we light emitted from the sun can be absorbed by atmospheric particles and warm the particles yes i 'm dancing but they oh my god not even at my wedding laughter they get enough energy to escape and break free from the gravity of the planet just by warming a second way they can get energy is from the solar wind are particles mass material and they go hurtling through interplanetary and they may provide energy for atmospheric particles to escape as this is something that i 'm interested in because it relates to habitability i mentioned that there were two things about the goldilocks story that i wanted to bring to your attention and remind you about and the second one is a little bit more subtle if papa bear 's bowl and mama bear 's bowl shouldn 't baby bear 's bowl be even colder if we 're following the trend this thing that you 've accepted your entire life when you think about it a little bit more may not be so simple but maybe there are other things we should be thinking about maybe it 's the bowls themselves that are also helping to determine the outcome in the story what is just right but for selfish reasons related to my own research and the fact that i 'm standing up here holding the clicker and you 're not i would like to talk for just a minute or two about magnetic fields earth has one venus and mars do not magnetic fields are generated in the deep interior of a planet by electrically conducting churning fluid material that creates this big old magnetic field that surrounds earth if you have a compass you know which way north is venus and mars don 't have that if you have a compass on venus and mars congratulations you 're lost does this influence habitability well how might it deflecting solar wind particles around the planet in a bit of a force field type effect having to do with electric charge of those particles i like to think of it instead as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets and yes my colleagues who watch this later will realize this is the first time in the history of our community that the solar wind has been equated with mucus is that earth may have been protected for billions of years because we 've had a magnetic field atmosphere hasn 't been able to escape mars on the other hand has been unprotected because of its lack of magnetic field and over billions of years maybe enough atmosphere has been stripped away to account for a transition from a habitable planet to the planet that we see today other scientists think that magnetic fields may act more like the enabling the planet to to interact with more energy from the solar wind than the planet would have been able to interact with by itself the sails may gather energy from the solar wind the magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen it 's an idea that has to be that 's because we know energy from the solar wind is being deposited into our atmosphere here on earth that energy is conducted along magnetic field lines down into the polar regions resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora if you 've ever experienced them it 's magnificent this in any way so i including the maven spacecraft which is currently orbiting mars we have similar measurements from venus and earth and we can understand how all three planets interact with their space environment with the surroundings and we can decide whether magnetic fields are important for habitability and financially as well but deeply but how they were billions of years ago including planets that we 're now observing around other stars for example the kepler spacecraft which is stamp sized region of the sky for a couple years now and it 's found thousands of planets in one postage stamp sized region of the sky that we don 't think is any different from any other part we 've gone in twenty years from knowing of zero planets outside of our solar system to now having so many that we don 't know which ones to investigate first any lever will help in fact based on observations that kepler 's taken and other similar observations we now believe that of the two hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy alone every star has at least one planet in addition to that estimates suggest there are somewhere between forty billion and one hundred billion of those planets that we would define as habitable we have the observations of those planets but we just don 't know which ones are habitable yet it 's a little bit like being trapped on a red spot laughter on a stage and knowing that there are other worlds out there and desperately wanting to know more about them wanting to interrogate them and find out if maybe just one or two of them are a little bit like you and so you have to use the tools that you 've developed and hope that you 're making reasonable inferences from the data and that you 're going to be able to determine the best candidates for habitable planets and those that are not in this is our red spot although very soon we may come to know of more and this is our red spot i 'm really glad we 're here"
