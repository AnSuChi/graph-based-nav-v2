  "transcript": "technology can change our understanding of nature take for example the case of lions for centuries it 's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna and male lions do nothing until it 's time for dinner you 've heard this too i can tell tell well recently i led an airborne mapping campaign in the kruger national park in south africa our colleagues put gps tracking collars on male and female lions and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air and the right shows whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances usually during the day male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation and often at night this video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right and this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions all of a sudden you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which because it emphasizes how little we know about nature i find it ironic that we 're doing so much yet these areas are fairly unknown to so how can we save what we don 't understand but above all i 'm obsessed with what we don 't know about our planet or cao it may look like a plane with a fancy paint job but i packed it with over one thousand kilos and a very motivated staff of earth scientists and pilots two sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly five hundred thousand times per second this is a small town in the amazon imaged with the cao we can slice through our data and see for example the 3d structure of the vegetation and the buildings the hottest pinks are the fastest growing plants and we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined this is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon this is how we see a rainforest in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another so our imagery is 3d the first questions is how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if unfortunately global carbon emissions from deforestation so it 's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation basically we need a high tech accounting system obviously closed canopy tropical forest and then you see the cookie cutting or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens it 's like cutting a cake except this cake and what 's amazing is even though we flew very high above this forest later on in analysis we can go in and actually experience the treetrops leaf by leaf branch by branch just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves we 've been using the technology explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the amazon basin and not so faraway places like the united states and central america what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take the colors are going to be going from red to blue red is extremely high carbon stocks your largest cathedral we can fly to this area in northern peru and see super high carbon stocks in red and the amazon river and floodplain cutting right through it we can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation we can also fly to the southern andes and we can go to the biggest swamp in the western amazon it 's a watery dreamworld akin to jim cameron 's avatar we can go to one of the smallest tropical countries panama and see also a huge range of carbon variation from high in red to low in blue but what you see that 's left in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds is the stuff that 's up in the mountains you 're seeing the buffer zone around the panama canal that 's in the reds and yellows the canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce this kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development it 's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change recurring droughts with red showing an area about the size of western europe the amazon was so dry in two thousand and ten that even the main stem of the amazon river itself dried up partially as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide what we found is that in very remote areas these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical almost totally unknown scientifically so what we think as earth scientists is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in brazil all the way west into the andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change one of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western amazon as we speak look at this gash in the forest created by gold miners you see the forest in green in 3d and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface if you haven 't been to the amazon you should go it 's an amazing experience every time but what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what 's really going on back in the forest itself we flew over this same river imaged the system in 3d the forest is on the left and then we can digitally remove the forest and see what 's going on below the and in this case we found gold mining activity all of it illegal set back away from the river 's edge as you 'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right don 't worry we 're working with the authorities to deal with this and many many other problems so in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique important corridors like the western amazon and the andes amazon we have to start making here you see actual data showing different species in different colors reds are one type of species blues and when we take this together and scale up to the regional level we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work this tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat and that 's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate and this is the pivotal information that 's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans the example i started out with about lions hunting that was a study we did and the truth is much of africa 's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like i show in blue on the screen some of their decisions have really big impacts for example how much and where to use fire as a management tool and let me tell you these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape dense vegetation a radically different ecosystem but what 's good is that the technology we 've developed and we 're working with in south africa for example is allowing us to map every single tree and how much that 's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna that 's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don 't lead to those extremes that i just showed you so really the way we 're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life where we have fire management elephant management those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions i 'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it thank you"
