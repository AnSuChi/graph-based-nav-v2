  "transcript": "human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other is that person dangerous we do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them what 's your name where are you from old are you what do you do then we get more personal with it have you ever had any diseases have you ever been divorced does your breath smell bad while you 're answering my interrogation right now what are you into who are you into what gender do you like to sleep with i get it we are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves we start forming cliques as soon as we 're old enough to know what acceptance feels like gender the block that we grew up on we seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices sometimes though just the what do you do can feel like somebody 's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it because so here 's a disclaimer about me though before we get too deep into this i grew up in a very sheltered environment i was i was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of where i come from if you weren 't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind you were the weirdo but as a kid on the streets of new york you learn how to trust your own instincts you learn how to go with your own ideas i went to school one day and the kids wouldn 't let me play basketball with them they said they wouldn 't let girls play so i went home and i shaved my head and i came back the next day and i said i 'm a boy i mean who knows right when you 're six maybe you can do that so i was playing a kid named walter in a movie called julian po i was a little street tough that followed christian slater around and badgered him see i was also a child actor which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity because no one knew that i was actually a girl really playing a boy in fact no one in my life knew that i was a girl not my teachers at my friends not the directors that i worked with when i would go to the bathroom i would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like i was peeing standing up at sleepovers i would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn 't want to kiss me without outing myself it i didn 't feel like i was in the wrong body like i was performing this elaborate act i wouldn 't have qualified as transgender if my family though had been the kind of people to believe in therapy they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty and i was ready to figure out who i actually was when a kid behaves like i did they don 't exactly have to come out right no one is exactly shocked it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl growing and changing in every moment proposition eight the great marriage equality debate was raising a lot of dust around this country and and i remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that between places where people believed in it and places where people and then that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me at the time i was just beginning to emerge from this eight year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl 's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy to finally just a hesitant exploration of what i actually was a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person i had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls much like myself who fell kind of girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear girls who had boys ' haircuts but wore girly nail polish i loved these people and i admired their freedom but i watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television and this powerful awareness rolled in over me that i was legally and indisputably but i plagued by this question how could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that i knew based on one element of their character and had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination they know who they were voting against and what the impact was perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second class citizenship obviously i couldn 't get twenty million people to the same dinner party so i figured out a way where i could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice without any lighting or without any because in a photograph you can examine a lion 's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off for me photography is not just about exposing film it 's about exposing the viewer to something new a place they haven 't gone before but most importantly to people that they might be afraid of life magazine introduced generations of people to distant far off cultures they never knew existed through pictures so i decided to make mugshots if you will and which if you don 't know is a limitless number of people so i ran and and then we made this self evident truths is a photographic record of lgbtq america today my aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who 's anything other than one hundred percent straight or feels like they fall in the lgbtq spectrum in any way my goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face we are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded there is no equality in the united i 've heard hundreds of people give the same answer we are all responsible for equality and we wouldn 't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the human rights campaign i want to visit i challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that almost eighty five thousand people watched that video and then they started emailing us from all over the country asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces so i changed my immediate goal to ten thousand faces and as of today i have traveled to almost twenty cities and photographed almost two thousand people but because if a picture is worth a thousand words of a face needs a whole new vocabulary familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family you 're far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it i met people who sparking empathy had become the backbone of self evident truths but it highlights but the complexities found within each individual person it wasn 't that we had too many boxes it was that we had too few at some point i realized that my mission to photograph inherently flawed because there were a million different shades of gay and i had perpetuated the very thing i had spent my life trying to avoid yet another box and i watched so many existential crises unfold in front of by and large people opted for somewhere between seventy to ninety five percent or the three to twenty percent marks of course there were lots of people who opted for a one hundred percent one or the other but i found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced i found that most people fall on a spectrum of what i have come to refer to as grey let me be clear though any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice i invite you to go out and try to be grey i 'll take your picture just for trying what i am saying though is that human beings are not the most important thing to take from the percentage system is this if you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between and the reality that this presents is a complicated one because for example if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior where exactly do you draw the line is it over here by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far or is it over here another interesting thing that i learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is after traveling so much and meeting so many people let me tell you there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and democrats aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle just being other than straight doesn 't necessarily mean that we have anything in common so in the endless proliferation of faces that self evident truths is always becoming perhaps in watching this procession of something interesting and useful will begin to happen hopefully these categories these binaries these over simplified boxes will begin to become useless because really they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are what we see and seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity the very least i hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights so is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing the right to adopt children the right to marriage the freedom to shop here live here buy here am i the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father your neighbor we already are all of those things and we always have been greet us as your fellow human beings period thank you"
