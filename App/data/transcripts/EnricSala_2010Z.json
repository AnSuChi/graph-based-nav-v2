  "transcript": "this is the mediterranean coast bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae something like this is what i first saw when i jumped in the water for the first time in the mediterranean coast off spain now if an alien came to earth let 's call him joe what would joe see if joe jumped in a coral reef there are many things the alien could see very unlikely joe would jump on a pristine coral reef a virgin coral reef with lots of coral sharks crocodiles manatees groupers turtles etc so probably what joe would see would be in this part in the greenish part of the picture and where the this is their baseline this is what they think is natural so i 'm going to get us and we 're going to the left we 're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like where we have conducted a series of national geographic expeditions this sea is an archipelago belonging to kiribati that spans across the equator so let 's start with the first one christmas over five thousand people most of the reefs are dead most of the corals are dead overgrown by algae and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them this is the place that captain cook discovered in one thousand seven hundred and seventy seven and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore let 's move the if we go back to a place the corals are doing better then we get to the places where the corals and where the predators are the most the parrotfish the surgeonfish that eat the algae then the plankton feeders this view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs we realized that the natural world was upside down this pyramid was inverted the top head the good news is that in addition to having more predators there 's more of everything the size of these boxes is bigger we have more sharks more biomass of snappers more biomass of herbivores too like these parrot fish they clean the reef everything that grows enough to be seen they eat and they keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish not only do these places these ancient pristine places have lots of fish but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams pavements of giant clams in the lagoons up to twenty twenty five per square meter these have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world and they filter the water they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens but this is great but the water gets warmer so how are these fish these predators going to help well what we have seen is that in this particular area the water was too warm for too long and many corals bleached and many died in christmas where the food web is really trimmed down where the the corals are not recovered but you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed so the turf of algae is a little lower then you go to palmyra atoll and the dead corals are clean and these places bleached too but they recovered faster the more intact the more complete [ and ] the more complex your food web the higher more likely that the system is going to recover from the short term impacts of warming events and that 's good news so we need to recover that structure we need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there so if we have to reset the the baseline if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left there are several ways one very clear way is the marine protected areas especially no take reserves that we set aside and let me go back to that image of the of the mediterranean this was my baseline this is what i saw when i was a kid and at the same time i was watching jacques cousteau 's shows on tv with all this richness and abundance and i thought that this richness belonged to tropical seas and that the mediterranean was a naturally poor sea until i jumped for the first time in a marine reserve and this is what i saw and then the algae grow again so you have this little algal forest and in the size of a laptop you can find more than one hundred species of algae hundreds of species of little and it brings six million euros to the local economy and it represents eighty eight percent of all the these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people who can benefit from the ecosystem if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby this is what happens the number of species increases twenty one percent so if you have one thousand species the size of organisms increases a third so your fish are now this big the abundance how many fish you have per square meter increases almost one hundred and seventy percent and the biomass this is the most spectacular change four point five times greater biomass on average just after five to seven years in some places up to ten times so we have all these things inside the reserve that grow and what do they do they reproduce they grow larger and this is how many eggs they they lay on the bottom outside the reserve you cannot even detect this the little larvae juveniles the more fish you have so the fishermen are catching more you can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined so there is spill over there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help while at the same time the reserve is protecting so what we have now or a world without reserves is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit reserves are like social economic and ecological and if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves this is like compound interest two examples again of how these reserves can benefit people this is how much fishermen get everyday in kenya fishing over series of years in a place where there is no protection it 's a free for all once the most the fishermen were catching more if you fish less you 're actually catching more another example and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of december and january for a week they used to aggregate up to the tens of thousands thirty thousand groupers about this big in one hectare in one aggregation fishermen knew about these things they caught them so we did a simple analysis and it doesn 't take and with the fishery total for the entire entire fishery several fishing boats now if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen the revenue would be more than twenty times higher and that would be sustainable over time so how much of this do we have if this is so good if this is such a of this do we have and you already heard that thanks to the protections of the chagos archipelago now is this possible people would ask how much would that cost well let 's think about how much we are paying now to subsidize fishing thirty five billion dollars per year there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering twenty percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction of what we are now paying the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing people are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing so how can we do that if it 's so clear that these savings accounts are good for the environment and for people why don 't we have twenty fifty percent of the ocean the problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people where there is no social conflict where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low and and a few of us a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working are working on this but what about the rest of the coast of the world where people live and make a living out of fishing well there are three main reasons why we don 't have tens of thousands of small reserves the first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do even if it 's small second the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don 't have the authority to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it it 's a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to to come and this is not effective and the government doesn have enough resources which takes us to the third reason why we don 't have many more reserves is that the funding models have been wrong ngos and governments so marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money and this is not sustainable so the solutions are just fixing these three issues first we need to develop a global awareness campaign to inspire local communities and governments we need to redesign our governance so so conservation efforts don 't depend on work from ngos or from government agencies we really need to develop business models where coastal conservation is an investment because we already know that these which is that no one organization alone is going to save the ocean and we need to develop a new model of partnership truly collaborative where we are looking for so let 's do that thank you very much biomass in the predators that seems impossible how could eighty five percent survive on fifteen percent es and the small one is moving fast they reproduce very fast they grow really fast they produce millions of eggs up there you have sharks and thirty years they reproduce very slowly they have a slow metabolism and basically they just maintain their biomass so basically the production surplus of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving they are like capacitors of our picture of a food pyramid is just we have to change that completely es at least in the seas what we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the serengeti with five lions per wildebeest and on land this cannot work but at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure we think this is universal but we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently ca so the numbers you presented you 're saying we 're spending thirty five billion dollars now on subsidies it would only cost sixteen billion to set up twenty percent of the ocean as marine protected areas that actually give new living we 've got nineteen billion to spend on health care or something es and then we have the under performance of fisheries that is fifty billion dollars so again one of the big solutions is have the world trade organization shifting the subsidies to sustainable practices ca okay so there 's a lot of examples that i 'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness so thank you for those numbers the last one 's a personal question a lot of the experience of people here who 've been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back it is a spiritual experience we go there to try to understand the ecosystems to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know feeling is this biophilia that e o wilson talks about where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature of raw nature and there only there you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem and if it were not for these places that show hope i don 't think i could continue doing this job it would be just too depressing"
