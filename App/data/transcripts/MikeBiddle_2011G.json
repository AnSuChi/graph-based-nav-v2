  "transcript": "because i absolutely hate waste i hope within the next ten minutes to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life and i 'd like to start at the very beginning think back when you perhaps it was like these toddler rules it 's my stuff if i saw it first the entire pile is my stuff if i 'm building something it 's your stuff if it 's broken and let me tell you why i have that perspective because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people 's discarded stuff now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff but it 's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world well less than one percent most people think of garbage we see above ground mines and the reason we see mines is because there 's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place because as we 've heard all week at ted they want the toys it 's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals and the metals we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world and the which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract and these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we 're already starting to see today particularly in regions of the world like here in europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner end of life stuff if it makes it to a recycler are the metals to put that in perspective and i 'm using steel as a proxy here for metals because it 's the most common metal probably over ninety percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose plastics are a whole other story well less than ten percent are are recovered in fact it 's more like five percent most of it 's incinerated or landfilled now most people think that 's because plastics are a throw away material have very little value 's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another so it 's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials and any plastic can be particularly from the united states where we don 't have any recycling policies in place like here in europe finds its way to developing countries for and they extract the metals by hand and it 's not fair it 's not safe and it 's not sustainable now because the plastics are so plentiful and by the way those other methods don 't lead to the recovery of plastics obviously this is just one example this is a photo i took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in mumbai india they store the plastics on the roofs they bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these and people try very hard to separate the plastics by color by shape by feel by any technique they can none of these techniques result in any so about twenty years ago i literally started in my garage tinkering around trying to figure out how to separate these very and we eventually broke the code this is the last frontier of recycling it 's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the earth and we finally figured out how to do it and in the process we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics we said there 's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life and we make a drop in replacement for that plastic that 's made from petrochemicals and they get to make the short time period i have i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits they recover the metals and leave behind what 's called shredder residue it 's their waste a paper you name and it goes in the first part of our process here which is more like traditional recycling we 're sieving the material we 're using magnets we 're using air classification it looks like the willy wonka factory at this point we grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail we use a very highly automated process we blend it in 50 000 lb blending silos we push that material to extruders where we melt it push it through small die and this becomes the currency of the plastics industry this is the same material we 're producing it from your old stuff and it 's going right back into your new stuff instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products in your office or back at work in your home and these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic replacing virgin plastic to make their new products we took our clues from mother nature and i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer that 's a label i 've always hated my entire life and think of yourself as just using resources in one form until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time and it 's my stuff thank you for your time"
