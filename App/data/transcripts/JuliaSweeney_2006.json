  "transcript": "and my father smiled and said well you know what that means don 't you that i 'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents and my dad said well yes but more importantly being seven means that you 've reached the age of reason and you 're now capable of committing any and all sins against god and man but when she said it the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil i hadn 't really paid all that much attention to that phrase age of reason but when you 're seven you 're old enough to know better so you 've grown up and reached the age and now god will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record time up till today all that time i was so good god didn 't notice it and my mom said well i noticed it and i thought how could i not have known this before how could it not have sunk in when they 'd been telling me all that being good and no real credit for it and worst of all how could i not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me i mean santa claus knows if you 're naughty or nice right and my dad said yeah but honey i think that 's technically just between thanksgiving and christmas there is no santa claus that upsetting to me my parents had this whole elaborate story about santa claus how they had talked to santa claus himself and agreed that instead of santa delivering our presents over the night of christmas eve like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing christmas morning our family would give santa more time which made me very suspicious it i mean my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style and my mother 's handwriting was so close to santa 's plus why would santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he 'd gone to everybody else 's there was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection by santa who was jolly but let 's face it he was also very judgmental so to find out that there was no santa claus at all was actually sort of a relief but rather i was just dumbfounded about how i could have missed this whole age of reason thing late for me but maybe i could help someone else someone who could use the information they the answer was clear my brother bill he was six well i finally found bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground it was a saturday and he was all by himself just kicking a ball against the side of a wall and then you 're capable of committing any and all sins against god and man and bill said so and i said so you 're six you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god won 't notice it but when i got to the top of the steps i turned around dramatically and said oh by the way bill there is no santa claus i didn 't know it at the time but i really wasn 't turning seven on september 10th for my 13th birthday i planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother i told them that your birthday was september 10th and then i wasn 't sure just going to go blab it all over the place so i started to tell you your birthday was september 10th but julie you were so ready to start school honey you were so ready then she said don 't worry julie every year on october 10th i made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day without me what was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that i had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends what was most upsetting was that this meant i was not a virgo i had a huge virgo poster in my bedroom and i read my horoscope every single day and it was so totally me but the libra poster is just a huge this was around the time that i started filling out physically and i was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls and frankly the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing but i got the new libra poster and i started to read my new libra horoscope and i was astonished to find that it was also it wasn 't until years later looking back on this whole oh life can be so cruel one day two mormon missionaries came to my door now i just live off a main thoroughfare in los angeles and my block is well it 's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door sometimes i get little old ladies from the seventh day adventist church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven and sometimes i get teenagers who promise me that they won 't join a gang and just start robbing people if i only buy some magazine subscriptions from them so normally i just ignore the doorbell but on this day i answered and there stood two boys each about nineteen in white from god from god and they said yes now i was raised in the pacific northwest around a lot of church of latter day saints people and you know i 've worked with them and even dated them but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission and i guess i was sort of curious so i said well please come in and they looked really happy because i don 't think this happens to them all that often and i sat them down and i got them glasses of water i got them glasses of water don 't touch my hair that 's the thing you can 't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair ok laughter so i sat them down and i got them glasses of water and after niceties they said do you believe that god loves you with all his heart and i thought well of course i believe in god but you know i don 't like that word ' heart ' because it anthropomorphizes god and i don 't like the word ' his ' either because that sexualizes god but i didn 't want to argue semantics with these boys so after a very long uncomfortable pause i said then we have a story to tell you and they told me this story all about this guy named lehi who lived in jerusalem in six hundred and god came to lehi and said to him put your family on a boat and i will lead you out of here i said america from jerusalem to america by boat told me how lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced and over the course of six hundred years there were two great races of them the nephites and the lamanites and the nephites were totally totally good each and every one of them and the lamanites were totally bad and evil every single one of them just bad to the bone and he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold which he then buried near palmyra new york well i was just on the edge of my seat what happened to the lamanites and they said well they became our native yes then they told me how this guy named joseph smith and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed egyptian this point i just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch i wanted to say ok don 't start with this story even the scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start telling people all about xenu do you believe that god speaks to us through his righteous prophets and i said no i don 't what exactly do you mean by ' righteous ' and what do you mean by prophets like could the prophets be women and they said it is so wonderful that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy what is this wonderful gift god gave women i wondered maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men but no it wasn 't any of these gifts they said well it 's her ability to bear children even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were fifteen to the time they were it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god and they said they had more to say you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity oh dear if you 'd lost a leg well you get it back or if you 'd gone blind you could see i don 't have a uterus because i had cancer a few years ago so does this mean that if i went to heaven i would get my i 'm happy without it gosh what if you had a nose job and you liked it would god force you to get your old nose back then they gave me this book of mormon told me to read this chapter and that chapter and said they 'd come back and check in on me and i think i said something like please and smug in my more conventional faith but and they said we believe that god impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us that 's the son of god i mean i would think that 's equally ridiculous i 'm just so used to that story loves you with all his heart"
