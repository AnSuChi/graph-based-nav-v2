  "transcript": "a few days after my husband paul and paul said it 's going to be ok and i remember answering back just don 't know what ok means yet paul and i had met as first year medical students at yale he was smart and kind and super funny and he 'd say it 's for emergencies only i fell in love with paul as i watched the care he took with his patients seeking to understand the experience of illness and not just its technicalities he later told me he fell in love with me when he saw me cry over an but even in the heady days of young love we were learning how to approach suffering we got married and became doctors i was working as an internist and paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he started to lose weight and when he was admitted to the hospital a ct scan revealed tumors in paul and we loved her and each other we learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions the day we took paul into the hospital for the last time was the most difficult day of my life when he turned to me at the end and said i 'm ready i knew that wasn 't just a brave decision it was the right one paul didn 't want a ventilator and cpr in that moment the most important thing to paul was to hold our baby daughter nine hours later paul died i 've always thought of myself as a caregiver most physicians do and taking care of paul deepened what that meant learning to witness and accept his pain talking together through his choices those experiences taught me that resilience does not mean bouncing back to where you were before it is so and we get to decide what success looks like one of the first things paul said to me after whoa i guess we get to say anything out loud it was so shocking and heartbreaking and really comforting because it was so starkly honest and that honesty turned out to be exactly what we needed we agreed we would just keep saying things tasks like making a will or completing our advance directives tasks that i had always avoided i realized that completing an advance directive is an act of love codifying the promise i will be there i will honor your wishes that paperwork became a tangible part of our love story as physicians paul and i were in a good position to understand and even accept his diagnosis we weren 't angry about it luckily because we 'd seen so many patients huge strides are being made against lung cancer during that time paul wrote about his transition from doctor to patient he talked about feeling like he was suddenly at a crossroads and how he would have thought he 'd be able to see the path that because he treated so many patients maybe he could follow in their footsteps paul wrote i saw instead vacant gleaming white desert as if a sandstorm had erased all familiarity i had to face my mortality and try to understand what made my life worth living and i needed my oncologist 's help to do so the clinicians taking care of paul gave me an even deeper appreciation for my colleagues in health care we have a tough job we 're responsible for helping patients have clarity around their prognoses and that 's never easy but it 's especially tough sometimes we substitute hope by emphasizing said they painted a rosier picture than their honest opinion when describing a patient 's prognosis but researchers have found that when people better understand the possible outcomes of an illness but for us we also found that information months to a few years meant paul was i remember asking paul if he thought having to say goodbye to a child would make dying even more painful and his answer astounded me but because we were learning that living fully means accepting suffering paul 's oncologist tailored his chemo so he could continue working as a neurosurgeon which initially we thought was totally impossible when the cancer advanced and paul shifted from surgery to writing his palliative care doctor prescribed a stimulant medication so he could be more focused they asked him what he was willing to make those conversations are the best way to ensure that your health care paul joked that it 's not like that birds and bees talk you have with your parents where you all get it over with as quickly as possible and then pretend it never happened you revisit the conversation as things change you keep saying things out loud i 'm forever grateful because paul 's clinicians felt that their job wasn 't to try to give us answers they didn 't have or but to counsel paul through painful choices when his body was failing but his will to live wasn i received a dozen bouquets of flowers but i sent just one to paul 's oncologist because she supported his goals and she helped him weigh his choices she knew that living means more than just staying alive a few weeks ago a patient came into my clinic a woman dealing with and while we were talking about her life and her health care she said i love my palliative care team they taught me that it 's ok to say ' no ' but many patients don 't feel that compassion and choices did a study where they asked people about their health care preferences and a lot of people started their answers with the words well if i had a choice and when i read that if i understood better why one in four people receives excessive or unwanted medical treatment or watches a family member receive excessive or unwanted medical treatment we understand the real psychological consequences on patients and their families the things is we deal with them too half of critical care nurses and a quarter of quitting their jobs because of distress but doctors can 't make sure your wishes are respected until they know what they are would you want to be on life support if it offered any chance of longer life are you most worried but for all of us it 's our choice that 's true at the end of life and for medical care throughout our lives if you 're pregnant do you want genetic screening is a knee replacement right or not do you want to do dialysis in a clinic or at home the answer is it depends what medical care will help you live the way you want to i hope you remember that question the next time you face a decision in your health care and it is ok to say no to a treatment that 's not right for you there 's a poem by w s merwin it 's just two sentences long that captures how i feel now everything i do is stitched with its color for me that poem evokes my love for paul and a new fortitude that came from loving and losing him when paul said it 's going to be ok that didn 't mean that we could cure his illness instead we learned to accept both joy and sadness at the same time to uncover beauty and purpose both despite and because we are all born and we all die i leave flowers on paul 's grave i build bonfires on the beach and watch the sunset exercise and mindfulness meditation have helped a lot i hope i do get remarried most importantly i get to watch our daughter grow i 've thought a lot about what i 'm going to say to her when she 's older engaging in the full range of experience living and dying love and loss is what we get to do being human doesn 't happen despite suffering it happens within it when we choose not to hide from it our lives don 't diminish they expand maybe it 's a fight for something different than we thought but to help each other through not as soldiers but as shepherds that 's how we make it ok even when it 's not by helping each other through and a gorilla suit never hurts either"
