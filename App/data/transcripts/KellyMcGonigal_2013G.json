  "transcript": "i have a confession to make i want you to make a little confession to me in the past year i want you to just raise your hand if you 've experienced relatively little stress anyone how but that is not my confession my confession is this i am a health psychologist and my mission is to help people be happier and but i fear that something i 've been teaching for the last ten years and it has to do with stress i want to change yours let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress this study tracked thirty thousand adults in the united states for eight years and they started by asking people how much stress have you experienced in the last year they also asked do you believe that stress is harmful for your health they used public death records to find out who died okay but that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths one hundred and eighty two thousand americans died prematurely not from stress but from the belief that stress is bad for you now if that estimate is correct killing more people than skin cancer hiv aids and homicide see why this study freaked me out here i 've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health and here the science says yes when you change your mind about stress you can change your body and you 're told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you and to make sure you feel the pressure there are bright lights and a camera in your face like this and the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging non verbal feedback like this now that you 're sufficiently demoralized time for part two a math test and it 's going to be fun for me okay ninety six in increments of seven you 're going to do this out loud as that guy made a mistake we are going to have to start all over again you 're not very good at this are you okay if you were actually in this study you 'd probably be a little stressed out your heart might be pounding you might be breathing faster maybe breaking out into a sweat now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful that pounding heart is preparing you for action well they were less stressed out less anxious more confident and your blood vessels constrict like this it 's not really healthy to be in this state all the time but in the study when participants viewed their stress response as helpful their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this this it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage over a lifetime of stressful experiences this one biological change could be the difference heart attack at age fifty and living well into your and this is really what the new science of stress reveals that how you think about stress matters now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem and the idea is this stress makes you social to understand this side of stress we need to talk about a hormone oxytocin and i know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get it even has its own because it 's released when you hug someone but this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in oxytocin is it primes you to do things that strengthen close oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin but here 's what most people don 't your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other when life is difficult your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you okay well oxytocin doesn 't only act on your brain it 's a natural it also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress but my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and the cool thing is is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support either to seek support or to help someone else and listen up because this study could also save a life this study tracked about one thousand adults in the united states and they ranged in age from thirty four to ninety three and they started the study by asking how much stress have you experienced in the last year neighbors people in your community for every major stressful life experience like financial difficulties or family crisis that increased the risk of dying by thirty percent but and i hope you are expecting a wasn 't true for everyone people who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress related increase in dying zero and so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not how you think now i wouldn 't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress stress gives us access to our hearts the compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others your pounding physical heart working so hard to give you strength and energy and when you choose to view stress in this way you 're not just getting better at stress you 're actually making a pretty profound statement you 're saying that you can trust yourself and you 're remembering that you don 't have to face them it seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone 's life expectancy how would that extend to advice like if someone is making a lifestyle choice between say a stressful job and a non stressful job does it matter which way they go it 's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense km yeah and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is and so i would say that 's really the best way to make decisions is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows"
