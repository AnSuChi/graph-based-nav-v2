  "transcript": "the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of and to the youngest son he left a ninth of the camels sons got into a negotiation seventeen doesn 't divide by two you can have my camel so then they had eighteen camels first son took his half half of eighteen is nine the second son took his third a third of eighteen is six the youngest son took his ninth a ninth of eighteen is two they gave it back to the wise old woman now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in they start off like camels no way to resolve it somehow what we need to do is step back from those situations like that wise old woman look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel 18th camel in the world 's conflicts has been my life passion i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers we 're thanks to the communications revolution all the tribes on the planet all fifteen thousand tribes are in touch with each other it 's not all peace and light there 's a lot of conflict how do we deal with our deepest differences given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction that 's the question as i 've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i 've been asking myself that who can play a constructive role an example about twenty years ago i was in south africa working with the parties in that conflict and i had an extra month so i spent some time within living memory they were hunters and gatherers living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe ninety nine percent of the human story and all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting and then everyone sits around in a circle like this and they sit and they talk and they talk it may take that system i call the third side because if you think there 's always two sides it 's arabs versus israelis labor versus management husband versus wife republicans versus democrats and we can play an incredibly constructive role perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what 's really at stake it 's very easy to react human beings we 're reaction machines and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret and so the third side reminds us of that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place and the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said you should stay right here in your seats because you 're going to be on trial for war crimes and then he turned to me and said you 're an american look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico and my mind started racing puerto rico what do i know about puerto rico i started reacting but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we 're among friends and can speak candidly to one another and what we 're here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past we 're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in chechnya that 's the role of the third side to help the parties go to the balcony now let me take you for a moment question is where 's the third side there now i don 't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i 've got a first step literally a first step something that any one of us could do let me just ask you one question first how many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do just out of curiosity how many of you so the great majority of us and here it 's so far away why do we pay so much attention this conflict stories matter as an anthropologist i know that stories are what we use to they give meaning to our lives that 's what we tell here at ted we tell stories stories are the key and so my question is is what 's the origin story of the middle east in a phrase it 's four thousand years ago a man and his family walked across the middle east and the world has never been the same since but it 's not just what he stood for it 's what his message was his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all and his basic value he 's the one who reminds us that we 're all part of a greater whole now think about that for a moment terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to sow and create understanding or respect or love which is a third side story what if that could be because abraham stands for hospitality what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life how would you do that and because the simple way to do that is you retrace the footsteps of abraham you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human it 's funny when you walk you walk now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you you would feel but if i walk it 's no problem so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path a route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the you can 't retrace the footsteps of abraham it 's too insecure you 've got to cross all these borders it goes across ten different countries in the middle east because it unites them all and then a few years ago a group of us about twenty five of us from ten different countries decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham going from his initial birthplace in the city of urfa in southern turkey northern mesopotamia and where in the bible he sets off on his journey then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey how many of you have had the experience comes up to you and shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal that 's the essence of of the abraham path that 's what you discover as you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father ibrahim let me offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he 's alive thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of abraham they 've begun to walk in israel and palestine in jordan in turkey in young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can 't walk in so paulo brazil it 's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting they lavish attention on it and last month there was a quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope and so that 's what it 's about but it 's not just about psychology it 's about economics and this woman right here um ahmad is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan she 's partially blind her husband and so she 's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and and so more and more walkers have come and so she told our our team there she said you have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me that 's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the middle east across the path and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from hostility to hospitality from terrorism to tourism and in that sense i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the what would the oak tree look like when i spent in europe you had been in the ruins of say london in and a common economy so my question is if it can be done in europe so let me conclude then by saying that in the last thirty five years as i 've worked in some of the most dangerous difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict even as a very small step we 're about to take a break in a moment just go up to someone who 's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them why not a ted walk so let me just leave you with three things one is the secret to peace the third side is us each of us with a single step can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace there 's an old african proverb that goes when"
