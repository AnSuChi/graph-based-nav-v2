  "transcript": "the final frontier i wanted to explore strange new worlds i wanted to seek out new life i wanted to see everything that the universe had to offer now i learned i learned that the reality was i wouldn 't be piloting a starship but i also learned that the universe is strange wonderful and vast actually too vast to be explored by spaceship i show you before you you might see it anywhere in the world and all of these stars are part of our local galaxy the milky way you might see the center of our milky way galaxy spread out before you hundreds of billions of stars you can see there 's a sort of strange dark dust across it now that is local dust that 's obscuring the light of the stars it 's possible to do better you can use now astronomers have put together this image it 's called the hubble deep field and they 've spent hundreds of hours observing just a tiny patch of the sky no larger than your thumbnail held at arm 's length and in this image you can see thousands of i can continue this journey this is easy i can just use a very powerful telescope and just look at the sky no problem it 's actually really missing out if we if we just do that now there 's also two very important problems with using visible light not only are we missing out on all the other processes that are emitting the dust stops the visible light from getting we see less light the dust stops it getting to us now say you 're standing on a corner a busy street corner there 's cars going by the siren appeared to change in pitch as it moved towards and away from you the ambulance driver did not change the siren just to mess with you and they sounded the same thing happens with light objects moving towards us their light waves are compressed and they appear bluer objects moving away from us their light waves are stretched and they appear redder so we call these effects our universe is expanding so everything is moving away from everything else and that means everything appears to be red so they appear more red so if i come back to the hubble deep field and we were to continue to peer deeply into the universe just using the hubble as we get to a certain distance away everything becomes red and that presents something of a problem eventually we get so far away everything is shifted into the infrared and we can 't see anything at all i wanted to explore the whole universe not just whatever i can see you know before the redshift kicks in there is a technique it 's called radio astronomy astronomers have been using this for decades it 's a fantastic technique i show you the parkes radio telescope affectionately known as the dish you may have seen the movie and redshift is less of a problem because so what does parkes see when we turn it to the center of the milky way we should see something fantastic right well we do see something interesting all that dust has gone as i mentioned radio goes straight through dust so not a problem we can see that the center of the milky way is aglow and this isn 't starlight this is a light called synchrotron radiation and that so we don 't really know what is the color of everything in here we can build telescopes which can get over these problems now i 'm showing you here an image of the murchison radio observatory a fantastic place to build radio telescopes it it 's radio quiet the telescope that i 've been working on for a few years is called the murchison widefield array and i 'm going to show you a little time lapse of it being built this is a group of undergraduate and they 're putting together these radio dipoles they just receive at low frequencies a bit like your fm radio or your tv and the interesting thing is there 's no moving parts we just deploy these little antennas essentially on chicken mesh it 's fairly cheap now eventually all those cables bring them to a unit which sends it off to a supercomputer here and that 's where i come in i have spent the last five years working with very difficult very interesting data that no one had really looked at before i 've spent a long time calibrating it running millions of on supercomputers and really trying to understand that so i 'm delighted to share with you some images from this survey you can see that the galactic plane is no longer dark with dust it 's alight with synchrotron radiation our large magellanic cloud our nearest galactic neighbor is orange instead of its more familiar blue white so there 's a lot going on in this let 's take a closer look if we look back towards the galactic center you can see the now it 's not a false color view these are real radio colors so for instance now if we zoom in these blue dots are ionized plasma around very bright stars and these can tell us about these and we just see them immediately we look at the galaxy and the color tells us that they 're there you can see little soap bubbles little circular images around the galactic plane and these are supernova remnants when a star explodes its outer shell is cast off and it travels outward into space gathering up material and it produces a little shell astronomers where all the supernova remnants are high energy electrons in the plane to produce the synchrotron radiation that we see and we think they 're produced by supernova remnants but there don 't seem to be enough fortunately gleam is really really good at detecting supernova remnants so we 're hoping to have a new paper out on that soon now that 's fine a if we zoom in on this we can see that there are two huge plumes going out into space and if you look right in the center between those two plumes you 'll see a galaxy just like our own a spiral it has a dust lane what 's going on what 's producing these jets at the center of every galaxy that we know about now black holes are invisible that 's why they 're called that all you can see is the deflection of the light around them forming what we call an accretion disk the accretion disk glows brightly in the x rays and huge magnetic fields can launch the material into space at nearly the speed of light so these jets are visible in the radio and this is what we pick up in our survey well very well so we 've seen one radio galaxy ok two well what about all the other dots presumably those are just stars they 're not they 're all radio galaxies every single one of the dots in this image millions to billions of light years away with a supermassive black hole at its center it is so it 's truly epic journey we 've discovered all of these galaxies right back to the very first supermassive black holes i 'm very proud of this and it will be published next week that 's not all i 've but there 's something even more in this image so the universe went from neutral to ionized that imprinted a signal the signal was redshifted it 's a billionth the size of any of the objects in my survey so our telescope may not be quite sensitive enough to pick up this signal however there 's a new radio telescope we 're building the square kilometre array a new radio telescope and it 's going to be a thousand times bigger than the mwa a thousand times more sensitive and have an even better resolution so we should find tens of millions of galaxies"
