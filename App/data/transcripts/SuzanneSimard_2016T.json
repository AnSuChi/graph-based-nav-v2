  "transcript": "underground there is this other world a world of infinite biological pathways that connect trees and allow them to communicate and allow the forest to behave as though it 's a single organism it might remind you of a sort of intelligence how do i know this they were giants and how my family was knit into it and my first big aha moment was at the outhouse by our lake our poor dog jigs had slipped and fallen into the pit he was down swimming in the muck but as grandpa dug through that forest floor i became fascinated with the roots and under that what i learned later was the white mycelium and under that the red and yellow mineral horizons but it was at that moment that i realized that that palette of roots and soil was really the foundation of the and i soon found myself conflicted by my part in it not only that the spraying and hacking of the aspens and birches to make way for the more commercially valuable planted pines and firs but this was in the laboratory and i eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest and i had no money so i had to do it on the cheap so i went to canadian tire laughter syringes full of radioactive carbon 14 carbon dioxide gas and some high pressure bottles of the stable isotope carbon 13 carbon but i was legally permitted oh well and i had no bear spray but you know this is how forest research in canada goes and then i put the plastic bags over my trees i got my giant syringes and i injected the bags with my tracer isotope carbon dioxide gases first the birch i injected because i was wondering whether there was communication going on between these species i got to the final bag and she started to chase me and i had my syringes above my head and i was swatting the mosquitos and i jumped into the truck and i thought this is why people do lab studies i waited an i figured it would take this long for the trees to suck up the co2 through photosynthesis turn it into sugars send it down into their roots and i checked for mama grizzly i went to my first bag with the birch i pulled the bag off i ran my geiger counter over its leaves kkhh perfect the birch had taken up the radioactive gas i went over to the fir tree and i heard the most beautiful sound kkhh it was the sound of birch talking to and birch was saying hey can i help you and fir was saying yeah can you send me some of your carbon because somebody threw a shade cloth over me and as i suspected silence cedar was in its own world it was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir fir i was so excited i ran from plot to plot and i checked all eighty replicates the evidence was clear the c 13 and c 14 was showing me that paper birch and douglas fir were in a lively two way conversation it turns out at that time of the year in the summer that birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch and this was because the fir was still growing while the birch was leafless so it turns out the two species were interdependent like yin and yang and at that moment everything came into i knew i had found something big and i had found solid evidence of this massive belowground communications network the other world now i truly hoped and believed that my discovery would change how we what was i thinking i well as forest scientists we have to do our research in the forests and that 's really tough as i 've shown we have to be really good at running from bears and then we 've got to gather our data and then go verify for me i 've conducted and published hundreds of experiments in the forest some of my oldest experimental plantations are now over thirty years old you can check them out that 's how forest science works so now i want to talk about the science how were paper birch and douglas fir communicating well it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon but also nitrogen and phosphorus and water and defense signals and allele chemicals and hormones information and you know i have to tell you before me scientists had thought that this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza was involved mycorrhiza literally means fungus root because coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium and that mycelium infects and colonizes the roots of all the trees and plants and where the fungal cells interact with the root cells there 's a trade of carbon for nutrients and that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil and coating every soil particle the web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium under a single and not only that that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest we made this map by examining the short sequences of dna of every tree and every fungal individual in a patch of douglas fir the circles represent the douglas fir or the nodes and the lines represent the interlinking fungal highways or the links darkest nodes or more fondly mother trees the ones growing in the understory and if you can see those yellow dots those are the young seedlings that have established within the network of the old mother trees in a single forest a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees and we 've associated this with increased seedling survival by four times and i wondered could douglas fir recognize its own kin and it turns out they do recognize their kin mother trees colonize their kin when mother trees are injured or dying so we 've used isotope tracing to trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree down her trunk into the mycorrhizal network and into her neighboring seedlings so trees talk well at least some families laughter so let 's come back to the initial point forests aren 't simply collections of trees they 're complex systems with hubs and networks that overlap and connect trees and allow them to communicate and they provide but they 're also vulnerable vulnerable not only to natural disturbances like bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees but high grade logging so now how are you thinking about forests well i want to take a check on that thirty years later here in western canada this is about one hundred kilometers to the west of us just on the border of banff national park that 's a lot of clear cuts it 's not so pristine and i bet you thought it was brazil in canada it 's three point six percent per year now by my estimation that 's about four times rate that is sustainable which creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks not only that we 're continuing to plant one or two species and weed out the aspens and birches these simplified and as climate changes this is creating a perfect storm or that how can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change well you know the great thing about forests as complex systems is they have enormous capacity to self heal patch cutting and retention of hub trees and regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes they recover really rapidly and we can 't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on you see most of our forests now are managed using a i don 't mean no cutting but we need to be conservationists fourthly and finally we need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species and genotypes and structures by planting and allowing natural regeneration we have to give mother nature the tools she needs to use her intelligence to self heal and we need to remember that forests aren 't just a bunch of trees competing with each other jigs 's fall into the outhouse showed me thank you"
