  "transcript": "as other speakers have said it 's a rather daunting experience a particularly daunting experience to be speaking in front of this audience or the really clever innovative ways people are or even the challenges of in the modern global economy my brief as you 've just heard is to tell you about statistics and to be more precise to tell you some exciting things about statistics and that than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me laughter one of my senior colleagues told me when i was a youngster in this profession rather proudly that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn 't have the personality skills to become accountants laughter and there 's another in joke among statisticians and that 's how do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician to which the answer is the extroverted statistician 's the one who looks at the other person 's shoes but i want to tell you something useful and here it is so concentrate now this evening there 's a reception in the university 's museum of natural history and it 's a wonderful setting as i hope you 'll find and a great icon to the best of it 's very unlikely in this special setting and this collection of people but you might just find yourself talking to you 're making it up and then one of two things will happen they 'll either discover their long lost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them and you 'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to it 's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do we 're not top on people 's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on and it 's something i 've never really found a good way of doing but my wife who was then my girlfriend managed it much better than i 've ever been able to many years ago when we first started going out she was working for the bbc in britain and i was at that stage working in america i was coming back to visit her she told this to one of her colleagues who said do sarah thought quite hard about the things i 'd explained and and she concentrated in those days on listening so than i had any right to expect and went on and said what does he model well sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said genes he models genes that is my first love and that 's what i 'll tell you a little bit about what i want to do more generally is so here 's the scene for the first question i 'm going to ask you can you imagine tossing a coin successively and for some reason which shall remain rather vague so suppose we toss a coin repeatedly then the pattern so you might think there are more interesting things to do but humor me for the moment imagine this half of the audience each get out coins and they toss them until they first see the pattern first time they do it maybe it happens after the 10th toss as here the second time maybe it 's after the fourth toss the next time after the 15th toss so you do that lots and lots of times and you average those numbers that 's what i want this side to think about the other half of the audience doesn 't like head tail tail they think for deep cultural reasons that 's boring and they 're much more interested in a different pattern head tail head so on this side you get out your coins ok so on this side you 've got a number you 've done it lots of times so you get it accurately which is the average number of tosses until you 've got a number the average number of tosses until so here 's a deep mathematical fact if you 've got two numbers one of three things must be true either they 're the same or this one 's bigger than that one so what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see head tail head with the average number of tosses until we first see head tail tail who thinks that a is true that on average it 'll take longer to see head tail head than head tail tail who thinks that b is true that on average they 're the same who thinks that c is true that on average it 'll take less time to see head tail head than head tail tail ok who hasn 't voted yet because that 's really naughty i said you had to so most people think it 's not a is true here it takes longer on average in fact the average number of tosses till head tail head is ten and the average number of tosses until head tail tail is eight how could that be anything different about the two patterns you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses you can 't do that with head tail tail that turns out to be important there are two ways of thinking about this i 'll give you one of them so imagine let 's suppose we 're doing it on this side remember you 're excited about and we get a head and you start sitting on the edge of your seat because something great and wonderful or awesome might be about to happen the that 's great you 're done and you celebrate and you keep tossing to wait for the next on this side there 's a different experience it 's the same for the first two parts of the sequence you 're a little bit excited with the first head you get then you toss the coin if it 's a tail you crack open the champagne if it 's a head you 're disappointed but you 're still a third and that 's an informal way of of presenting it that 's why there 's a difference another way of thinking about it if we tossed a coin eight million times then we 'd expect a million head tail heads and a million the clumps will be further another way of getting what 's the point i want to make it 's a very very simple example an easily stated question in probability which every you 're in good company everybody gets wrong there 's a connection between head tail heads and head tail tails in genetics and it 's the following when you toss a coin you get a sequence of heads and tails when you look at dna there 's a sequence of not two things heads and tails but four letters as gs cs and ts and they 're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology and instead of asking the question how long until i see a head tail head you can ask how big will the chunks be when i use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees for example how long will those chunks be that 's a rather trivial connection between there 's a much deeper connection which i don 't have time to go into and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science and we 'll hear some talks but it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies a key part of that has to do and i will give you two little snippets two examples of projects we 're involved in in my group in oxford both of which i think are rather exciting you know about the human genome project that was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome the natural thing to do after you done that and that 's what this project the international hapmap project which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries think of the human genome project as learning what we 've got in common and the hapmap project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people why do we care about that well there are lots of reasons the most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease type 2 diabetes for example and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease or stroke or autism and so on that involving very large studies thousands of individuals with each of eight different diseases and coronary heart disease bipolar disease and so on why do we want to do that because we understand very little about most human diseases we don 't know what causes them and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventative treatment and so on so that 's as i said the little diversion here 's another quiz for you and i test them for the disease in question let 's suppose there 's a test for hiv the virus that causes aids and the test says what 's the chance that they do the come on everyone 's got to get involved don 't think you don 't trust me anymore you 're right to be a bit skeptical because that 's not the that 's what you might think it 's not the answer and it 's not because it 's only part of the story it actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is so let me try and illustrate that here 's a little caricature of amongst these million individuals most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease and in fact if this is the prevalence of the disease about one hundred will have the disease and the rest so now suppose we test them all but there are so many of them enormous number of false positives put that another way of all of them who test positive so here they are the individuals involved less than one in one hundred the important part of the story is there 's another bit of information we need what we have to once we know the test is positive is to weigh up the plausibility or the likelihood of two competing explanations each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit one explanation is that the person doesn 't have the disease that 's overwhelmingly likely if you pick someone at random which is unlikely the other explanation is that the person does have the disease that 's unlikely but the test gets it right which is likely and the number we end up with that number which is a little bit less than one in one hundred is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other each of them taken together is unlikely here 's a more topical example of exactly the same thing those of you in britain will know about what 's become rather a celebrated case of a woman called sally who had two babies who died suddenly and initially it was thought that they died of what 's known informally as cot death and more formally as sudden infant death syndrome innocent deaths in a family like hers which was professional and later and fairly recently acquitted on appeal in fact on the second appeal and just to set it in context you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child and then two if they 're innocent to be convicted of murdering them to be put through the stress of the trial convicted of murdering them and to spend time in a women 's prison where all the other prisoners think you killed your children is a really awful thing to happen to someone and it happened in large part here because the expert in two different ways so where did he get the one in seventy three million number he looked at some research which said the chance of one cot death in a family like sally clark 's is about one in eight thousand five hundred 'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren 't changed it 's like saying if you toss a coin and get a head the first time that won 't affect the chance of getting a head the second time so if you toss a coin twice the chance of getting a head twice assume that these seventy three million and none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way unfortunately here and really regrettably first of all in a situation like this you 'd have to verify it might well be so if a family suffers from one cot death you 'd put them in a high risk group they 've probably got these environmental risk factors and or genetic risk factors we don 't know about and to argue then that the chance of a second death is as if you didn 't know that information is really silly it 's worse than silly it 's really bad science nonetheless that 's how it was presented and at trial nobody even argued it that 's the first problem the second problem is what does the number of one in seventy three million mean so after sally clark was convicted you can imagine it made rather a splash in the press one of the journalists from from one of britain 's more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was the chance that she was innocent was one in seventy three million it 's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test which is ninety nine percent accurate the chance of having the disease is ninety nine percent in the disease example we had to bear in mind two one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not and the other one was the chance a priori that the person had the disease or not it 's exactly the same in this context there are two things involved two parts to the explanation we want to know how likely or relatively how likely two different explanations are one of them is that sally clark was innocent which is a priori overwhelmingly likely most mothers don 't kill their children and then if she were trying to kill the children she succeeded seventy three million we don 't know what it it has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence we know the children died what matters is how likely or unlikely relative to each other the two explanations are and they 're both implausible there 's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences in fact there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician who have subsequently been released on appeal many cases were reviewed and it 's particularly topical because he 's currently facing a disrepute charge at britain 's so just to conclude what are the take home messages from this well we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life it 's also true and although we can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty that 's an issue in our everyday lives as you 've heard from many of the talks statistics underpins an enormous amount of research in science in social science in medicine and indeed quite a lot of industry all of quality control which has had a major impact on industrial processing is underpinned by statistics it 's something we 're bad at doing at the very least we should recognize that and we tend not to to go back to the so if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury i know how to build bridges i 've built one down the road please drive your car home over it they would have said well pediatricians don 't know how to build bridges that 's what engineers do or implied i know how to reason with uncertainty that 's fine he 's an expert so we need to understand where our competence is and isn 't when scientists and lawyers and in some cases judges routinely misrepresented evidence but misrepresented evidence forensic scientists said the chance that this guy 's innocent is one in three million even if you believe the number just like the and there have been celebrated appeal cases in britain and elsewhere because of that"
