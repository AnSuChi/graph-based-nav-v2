  "transcript": "i want to talk to you about throughout much of the recent history of medicine we 've thought about illness and treatment in terms of a profoundly in fact the model is so simple the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution many of you might not know this but we happen to be celebrating the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the united states but what you do know here you had and it would course through your body it would its target lock into its target a microbe or some part of a microbe and then turn off a lock and a key tuberculosis and transforming that into a curable or treatable illness you have a pneumonia so seductive so potent and we 've really spent the last one hundred years trying to replicate that model over and over again but it 's only worked if you take the entire universe of all chemical reactions in the human body every chemical that your body is capable of and now you ask the question what number or fraction of reactions can actually be targeted in other words you know if you think about human physiology as a vast global telephone network with interacting nodes and interacting pieces then all of our medicinal chemistry is operating on one tiny corner at the edge the outer edge of that network like all of our pharmaceutical chemistry is a pole operator in kansas who is tinkering with about ten or fifteen telephone lines in fact it turns out that the natural world gives us a sense of how one and we begin with a and these organisms ultimately live which are partly self regulating and partly what 's nice about this scheme this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than downwards is that it allows us to think about illness as well since the 1950s we 've tried rather desperately we 've tried to kill cells using a variety of and as most of us know that 's worked but eventually you run remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn 't grow in a vacuum it actually grows in a human organism and could you use the and finally there 's the level of the environment isn 't there you know we don 't think of cancer as altering the environment but let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment you take loneliness you take depression you take confinement and you add to that rolled up in a little white sheet of paper and you have a but you can have anti carcinogenic environments too there are attempts to we 're trying to change the metabolic milieu since the rewire it remodel it and that of course we know study upon study has shown that talk therapy does exactly that and study upon study has shown that talk therapy combined with medicines pills really is much more effective than either one alone can we imagine a more immersive environment that will change depression can you moving upwards along this hierarchical chain of organization what 's really at stake perhaps here in the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases kidney failure and that 's the key perhaps to reframing our thinking about medicine now this idea of changing of creating a perceptual shift as it were came home to me to roost in a very very personal manner about ten years ago about ten years ago i 've been a runner most of my life i went saturday morning run i came back and woke up and i basically couldn 't move my right knee was swollen up and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone and one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own mris and and it looked like that essentially the meniscus of cartilage if you 're looking at me feeling sorry let me tell you a few facts if i was to take an mri of every person in this audience sixty percent of you would show signs of bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this eighty five percent of all women by the age of seventy would show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration the second and we began to do simple experiments mechanically trying to fix this degeneration we tried to inject chemicals into the knee spaces of animals to try to reverse cartilage degeneration and to put a short summary on a very long and painful process nothing happened the nice thing about australians is that they 're habitually used to looking at the world upside down and so dan dan suggested to me you know maybe it isn 't a mechanical problem maybe it isn 't a chemical problem it 's a stem cell problem in other words he had two hypotheses number one there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell a skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton bone cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton just like there 's a stem cell in blood just like there 's a stem cell in the nervous system and two that maybe that the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell is what 's causing they live inside the skeleton here 's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them the white stuff is bone and these red columns of bone coming out of a single cell number one is that they live where they 're expected to live they live just underneath the surface of the bone underneath cartilage you know in biology it 's location location location appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage that 's one here 's an interesting property you can take them out number three the most efficient repairers of fractures that we 've ever encountered this is a little bone a mouse bone that we fractured and then let it heal by itself these stem cells have come in and repaired in yellow the bone in white the cartilage almost completely so much so that if you label them with a fluorescent dye you can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue coming into the area of a fracture the fourth one is the most ominous and that is that their numbers and in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea cells environments because we were now thinking about bone stem cells we were thinking about arthritis in terms of can you ascend right up and create we know that exercise remodels bone but come on none of us is going to exercise so could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone and perhaps more interesting and more importantly the question is can you apply this model more globally outside medicine what 's at stake as i said before is not and it raises a series of i think some of the most interesting questions about how we think about medicine in the future could your medicine be a cell how would we grow these cells what we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells we heard about the problems of unleashing growth implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing could that stop some of the degeneration what if the organ needed to have memory in cases of of diseases of of the nervous system how could we implant those memories back in could we store these organs would each organ have to be developed for an individual human being and put back and perhaps you know could we imagine that for our future i 've talked a lot about models i began this talk with models so let me end with some thoughts about model building that 's what we do as when an architect the latter is a perceptual shift created such a perceptual shift in our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored distorted very successfully the way we 've thought about medicine for the last hundred years but we need new models you know there 's a popular trope out there that the reason we haven 't had the transformative it 's certainly true that it would be lovely to have thank you chris anderson i really like this metaphor how does it link in there 's a lot of talk in of medicine that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically your genome your current context does that apply to this model you 've got here we 've thought about personalization of medicine very much in terms of genomics that 's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor again to use that same word in medicine today that chain of being really the first organized unit of that is the cell so if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies and then personalizing well in this there 's personalization all the way ca so when you say medicine could be a cell and not a pill you 're talking about potentially your own cells sm absolutely ca so converted to stem cells perhaps tested against all kinds of drugs or something and but incorporating genomics into what we call"
