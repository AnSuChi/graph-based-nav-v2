  "transcript": "canada 's boreal forest it stretches right across but you have the antlers as proof we 're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands wetlands globally are one of the most endangered ecosystems they 're absolutely critical ecosystems they clean air they clean water sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases and they 're home to a huge diversity of species they are also the home where almost fifty percent of the eight hundred bird species found in north america migrate north to breed and raise their young and these incredibly beautiful beautiful boreal forests were the inspiration for some of the most famous art in canadian history the group of seven were very inspired by this landscape and and this is the home of the newly designated unesco cultural heritage site home to some of our most famous rivers an incredible network of rivers and lakes that every non aboriginal explorers of northern canada that taking from the first nations people used canoes and paddled to explore for a trade route a northwest passage for the fur trade we have this incredible and the tombstone valley is home to the porcupine caribou herd now you 've probably heard about the porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in arctic national wildlife refuge well the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected the western border of the boreal in british columbia is marked by the coast mountains and on the other side of those mountains is the greatest remaining temperate rainforest in the world the great bear rainforest and we 'll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail all across the boreal it 's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples and and i think that one of the reasons why so many of these groups have retained a link to the past know their native languages and i think particularly now as we see ourselves in a time of environmental crisis we can learn so much from these people who have lived so sustainably in this ecosystem for over ten thousand years of this ecosystem is the very antithesis of all of these values that we 've been talking about and i think these are some of the core values that make us proud to be canadians this is the alberta tar sands the largest oil reserves on the planet outside of saudi arabia trapped underneath the boreal forest and wetlands of northern alberta are these vast and the mining and the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before if you look at that truck there it is the largest truck of its kind on the planet within the dimensions of that truck you could build a so instead of thinking of that as a truck think of that as a home that 's not a bad size home and line those trucks homes back and forth across there from the bottom all the way to the top and then think of how large that very small section of one mine is now you can apply that same kind of thinking now here you see of course as you go further on these trucks become like a pixel again how large is that one portion of a mine and this is just one ten mines so far right now this is one section of one mining complex and there are about another forty or fifty in the no tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval so it is essentially a rubber stamp it 's even more damaging in some ways it impacts and and produces at least as much greenhouse gas so these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging damaging as the mines the oil produced from either method produces and it is also a reason why canada is now number three in terms of producing carbon per person the tailings ponds are the largest toxic impoundments on the planet three to five barrels of water are taken semcrude just one of the licensees in just one of their tailings ponds dumps two hundred and fifty thousand tons of this toxic gunk every single day this is enough toxin to cover the face of lake erie a foot deep and the tailings ponds range in size up to nine thousand acres that 's two thirds the size of the entire island of manhattan that 's like from wall street at the southern edge of manhattan up to maybe 120th street and you can see in the context relatively small section of one of ten mining complexes and another forty to fifty on stream to be approved soon well you can 't see many ponds from outer space and you can see these so maybe we should stop calling them ponds these massive toxic wastelands are built unlined and on the banks of the athabasca river and the athabasca river drains downstream to a range of aboriginal communities the tar sands toxins are in the food chain and this is causing cancer rates up to ten times what they are in the rest of canada in spite of that people have to live have to eat this food in order to survive and not that many years ago i was lent a boat by a first nations man and he said when you go out on the river do not under any circumstances eat the fish he had to feed his family to survive i just can 't imagine and that 's what we 're doing the boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change the boreal forest sequesters and this is absolutely key so what we 're doing is we 're taking the most concentrated greenhouse gas sink twice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered in in the boreal per acre than the than the tropical and what we 're doing is we 're destroying which is producing the most and we 're doing this on the second largest oil reserves on the planet this is one of the reasons why canada originally a climate change hero we were one of the first signatories of the kyoto accord now we 're the country that has full time lobbyists in the european union and washington dc threatening trade wars when when these countries talk about wanting to bring in positive legislation to limit the import of high carbon fuels of greenhouse gas emissions anything like this at international whether they 're in copenhagen or cancun international conferences on climate change we 're the country that gets the dinosaur award every single day as being the biggest obstacle to progress on this issue just seventy miles downstream is the world 's largest freshwater delta the peace athabasca delta this is a globally significant wetland perhaps the greatest on the planet but it too is being threatened by the massive amount of water being drawn from the the athabasca which feeds these wetlands and also the incredible toxic burden of the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet which are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream and you can see here the the keystone pipeline which would take tar sands raw down to the gulf coast punching a pipeline and securing the contract with the dirtiest fuel in the in the world and promoting a huge disincentive to a sustainable future for america here you see the and building a pipeline with an industrial highway would change forever this incredible wilderness which is a true rarity on the planet today so the great bear rainforest is just over and soon we 're in the coastal temperate rainforest twenty feet across a completely different ecosystem and the great bear rainforest is generally considered to be and yet there 's a proposal of course to build a pipeline to take huge tankers ten times the size of the exxon valdez through some of the most carrying the dirtiest oil ten times as much as the exxon valdez eventually hits a rock and goes down we 're going to have one of the worst ecological disasters this planet has ever seen and here we have the plan out to two thousand and thirty what they 're proposing is an almost four times increase in production and that would industrialize an area the size of florida in doing so we 'll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink and replacing it with the most high emission oil in the future the world does not need any more tar mines the world does not need any more pipelines and the world certainly does not need the largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply and further threaten the downstream communities and let 's face it we all live downstream in an era of global global warming and climate change what we need is we all need to act to ensure that canada respects the massive amounts of freshwater that we hold in this country we need to ensure that these wetlands and forests that are and we need to all gather together fighting to stop this everyone across canada everyone listening to this presentation has a role to play and i think a responsibility because what we do here it 's going to color our possibility to survive and for our children to survive and have a rich future we have an incredible gift in the boreal it compromises the life and the health of some of our most underprivileged and vulnerable people the aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us it could destroy the athabasca delta it could destroy the and it could have huge impacts on the future of the agricultural heartland i hope that you will all if you 've been moved this presentation join with the growing international community to get canada to step up to its responsibilities to convince canada to go back to being a climate change and to say no to the tar sands and yes to a clean energy future for all thank you so much"
