  "transcript": "when i was in oncology at the children 's hospital in philadelphia and as i took the history it became apparent that the father and the and the father knew that he had passed that fate on to his son that moment changed my life it propelled me to go on and and in the intervening decades since then there a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases in fact for thousands of human traits a molecular basis that 's known for that and for thousands of people every day there 's information that they gain about the risk of going on to get this disease or that disease time if you ask has that impacted the efficiency how we 've been able to develop drugs the answer is not really if you look at the cost of developing drugs how that 's done it basically hasn 't budged that and so it 's as if we have the power to diagnose yet not the power to fully treat and there are two commonly given reasons for why that happens one of them is it 's early days we 're just learning the words the fragments the letters in the genetic code we don 't know how to read the sentences we don 't know how to follow the narrative the other reason given is that most of those changes are a loss of function and it 's actually really hard to develop but today i want us to step back and ask a more fundamental question and ask what happens if we 're thinking about this maybe in the wrong context we do a lot of studying of those who are sick and building up long lists of altered components but maybe if what we 're trying to do is to develop therapies for prevention maybe what we should be doing is studying those who don 't get sick maybe we should be studying those that are well a vast majority of those people are not necessarily carrying a particular genetic load or risk factor they 're not going to help us there are going to be those individuals who are carrying a potential future risk they 're going to go on to get some symptom that 's not what we 're asking and looking for is are there a very few set of individuals who are actually walking around with the if you 're going to do a study like that you can imagine you 'd like to look at lots and lots of people what 's your evidence that this could be feasible i want to give you two examples they went and astute clinicians tracked that down and what they found was they were carrying mutations notice second example more recent is elegant work done by helen hobbs who said i 'm going to look at individuals who have very high lipid levels and i 'm going to try to find those people with high lipid levels who don 't go on to get heart disease and again what she found was some of those individuals had mutations that were protective from birth that kept them even though they had high lipid levels and you can see this is an interesting way of thinking about how you could develop preventive therapies the project that we 're working on is called the resilience project a search for unexpected heroes because what we are interested in doing is saying can we find those rare individuals who might have these hidden protective and let 's pull them back a little bit by those that are known to have severe symptoms where the parents the child those around them would know that they 'd gotten sick of the genes where we know that there is a particular alteration maybe we should look not just here but in remote places where their might be a distinct genetic context there might be environmental factors that protect people and let 's look at a million individuals now the reason why we think it 's a there 's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost to do this type of analysis this type of data generation to where it actually costs less to do the data generation and analysis than it does to do the sample processing and the collection the other reason is that in the last five years there have been awesome tools things about network biology systems this is interesting i would be glad to join your effort i would be willing to participate and they didn 't say where 's the mta they didn 't say where is my authorship they didn 't say is this data going to be mine am i going to own it they basically said let 's work on this in an open and we began looking for because what we realized is maybe we could just go and look at some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility maybe we could take two three percent of the project on and see if it was there and so we started asking we asked leif up in finland we talked to anne wojcicki at and again often we 've analyzed them and we would be glad to go into our anonymized samples and see if we could find those that you 're looking for and instead of being twenty thousand or thirty thousand last month we passed one half million samples that we 've already analyzed so you must be going so we think that the time is now to launch the beta phase of this project and actually start getting prospective individuals basically all we need is information we need a swab of dna and a willingness to say what 's inside me i 'm willing to be to anointed experts we need individuals to step up in a different role and to be engaged crowd sourced project to evolve from the current concepts of resources and constraints to design those preventive therapies and to extend it beyond childhood diseases to go all to ways that we could look at alzheimer 's or parkinson 's we 're going to need us to be looking inside ourselves and asking what are our roles and thank you very much"
