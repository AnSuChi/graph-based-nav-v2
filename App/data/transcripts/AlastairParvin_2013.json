  "transcript": "and we tend to assume that it 's those professionals who are going to be the ones to help us solve the really big systemic design challenges that we face like climate change urbanization and social inequality and and a couple of things struck me about this one don 't listen to career advisers and two actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture which is that as a society we 've never needed design thinking more and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed it strikes me that we talk very deeply about design but actually there 's an economics behind architecture that we don 't talk about and i think we need to and a good place to start is your own paycheck so as a bottom of the rung architecture graduate i might expect to earn about twenty four thousand pounds that 's about thirty six thousand thirty seven thousand dollars which raises the question of who is it i 'm working for the uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture today and it always has been the reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when actually the one percent would build on behalf of the ninety nine percent for various different reasons whether that was through philanthropy in the through this inflated real estate bubble and we 're back in this situation where the smartest designers and architects in the world are only really able to work for one percent of the population now it 's not just that that 's bad for democracy though i think it probably is it 's actually not a very clever business strategy actually i think the challenge facing the next generation of architects is how are we going to turn our client from the one percent the first is i think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings and they said to the architects look our corridors are an absolute nightmare they 're far too small they get congested between classes there 's bullying so what we want you to do is re plan our entire building and we know it 's going to cost several million pounds but we 're reconciled to the fact don 't do that instead get rid of the school bell and instead of having one school bell that goes off once have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times distribute the traffic through the corridors now it looks like you 're doing yourself out of a job but you 're not you 're actually making yourself more useful architects are actually really really good at this kind of resourceful strategic thinking and i don 't think that needs to be the case anymore the second idea worth questioning is this 20th century thing that mass architecture is about big big buildings and big finance actually we 've got ourselves locked into this industrial era mindset which says that monolithic projects and of course so what you end up with are single monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of and when they do they bring with them a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live and it raises really interesting questions about how will we plan cities how will finance development how will we sell design services what would it mean for democratic societies to offer their citizens a right to build and in a way it should be kind of obvious right that in the 21st century maybe cities can be developed by citizens and thirdly we need to remember that from a strictly economic point of view design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly and that 's a good thing and the problem is that up until now it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools and that 's where 3d printing gets really really interesting right when suddenly you had a 3d printer that was open source the parts for which could be made on another 3d printer or the same idea here which is for a cnc machine which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood they 're challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it 's got to be distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone that really is an industrial revolution and when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all and we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture we started working on a project called wikihouse and wikihouse is an open source construction system and the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go access a freely shared library of 3d models and almost at the click of a switch they can generate a set of cutting files and and basically what you end up with is a really big ikea kit and a team of about two or three people working together can build this they don 't need any traditional construction skills they don 't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that and they can build a small house of about this size in about a day and what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation and services based on what 's cheap and what 's available our heads here so the house is not a finished product with the cnc machine you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door so we can begin to see the seed of a completely and we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now one of them is that it 's always incredibly sociable people get confused between construction work and having fun but the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane physical details like never designing a piece that can 't be lifted up or when you 're designing a piece make sure you either can 't put it in the wrong way round or if you do it doesn 't matter because it 's symmetrical probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school copying is good because actually this approach is not innovative it 's actually how we built buildings for hundreds of years before the industrial revolution in these sorts of community barn raisings the only difference between traditional vernacular architecture and open source architecture but it 's a really really big difference we shared the whole of wikihouse under a creative commons license and now what 's just beginning to happen is that groups around the world are beginning to take it and use it and hack it and tinker with it and it 's amazing there 's a and thanks to the ted city prize we 're working with an awesome group in one of rio 's favelas to set up a and actually there 's more people in the last week who have got in touch and they 're not even on this map i hope next time you see it you we 're aware that wikihouse is a very very small answer but it 's a small answer to a really really big question which is that globally right now the fastest growing cities are not skyscraper cities they 're self made cities in one form or another if these are the guys who are going to be making it you know like it or not welcome to the world 's biggest design team our existing development models aren 't going to do it as i think robert neuwirth said there isn 't a bank or a corporation or a government or an ngo who 's going to be able to do it if we treat citizens only as consumers how extraordinary would it be though if collectively we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we 've been working on but to infrastructure problems like by everyone and they 're accessible by everyone a kind of and i think the technology 's on our side"
