  "transcript": "wow this is the most honest group of people i 've ever met laughter so for the last twenty years i 'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made but to begin i 'm going to tell you a story from mr richard messina who is my friend and an elementary school principal he got a phone call one day my son johnny will not come to school today because he 's sick mr messina asks who am i speaking to please and the caller says i am my father so this story sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying one children only come to tell lies after entering elementary school there must be some character flaws with them and they are going to become pathological liars for life well it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong we make an excuse and leave the room and before we leave the room we tell them not to peek at the cards we have hidden cameras in the room of children will peek as soon as we leave the room the crucial question is when we return and ask the children whether or not they have peeked will the children who peeked we found that that regardless of gender country fifty percent lie more than eighty percent lie so as you can see lying is really a typical part of and some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age so now let 's take a closer look at the younger children why do some but not all young children lie in cooking you need good ingredients to cook good food two key ingredients the first key ingredient is theory of mind or the mind reading ability mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation and the ability to differentiate between what i know therefore i can lie to you the second key ingredient for good lying is self control it is the ability to control your speech your facial expression and your body language so that you can tell a convincing lie and we found that those young children who have more advanced and self control abilities tell lies earlier and are more sophisticated liars as it turns out these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society instead of being alarmed you should celebrate because has arrived the children are going to respond to a so try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children 's lies we have played similar kinds of games with many many adults and let 's find out how these adults performed because there are as many liars as so if your accuracy is around fifty percent it means you are a terrible detector of children 's lies so let 's start with undergrads and law school students who typically have limited experience with children no their performance is around chance now how about social workers and customs officers and police officers who deal with liars on a daily no they cannot so now you may ask why children 's lies are so difficult to detect let me illustrate this with my own son nathan this is his facial expression when he lies behind this neutral expression the child is actually experiencing a lot of and maybe a little bit of liar 's delight such emotions are either fleeting then we made a discovery there 's a rich network of blood vessels and these changes are regulated by the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control we can reveal we have developed a new imaging technology we call transdermal optical imaging and then using our image processing technology we can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes by looking at transdermal video images now we can easily see facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions inexpensively we discovered a pinocchio effect not this pinocchio effect and the facial blood flow on the nose increases so then we asked ourselves in how can our technology be used one application is in using this technology we can help this mathematics teacher to identify the student in his classroom who may experience high anxiety and also we can use this in and using this technology i can not only find out what 's going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate and perhaps in the future and you may ask can we use this also to reveal politicians ' emotions laughter for example during a debate well mood and stress if your date is smiling at you this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you and in this case she is just trying to be nice to you one thing i know for sure is that lying will never be the same again thank you very much"
