  "transcript": "many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task and we 're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired so before i talk about this car for the blind let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself you press start nobody touches anything and it can reach its destination fully autonomously we decided to give it a try because we thought hey how hard could it be we have already an autonomous vehicle we just put a blind person in it and we 're done right we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility and in the summer of two thousand and nine we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin it was an absolutely amazing so with this success obviously the driver cannot see so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver for that we use an initial measurement unit so it measures acceleration angular acceleration we fuse that information with a gps unit to get an estimate of the location of the car we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the any obstacles around the vehicle so all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer and the computer can do two things one is first of all process this information to have an understanding of the environment these are the lanes of the road there 's the obstacles and convey this information to the driver so for this we developed many different types of non visual user interface technology so starting ping sound system a vibrating vest a so these are a pair of gloves and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer the direction and the intensity so this is a chair as a matter of fact it 's actually a massage chair and we actuate them to convey information about the speed and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal so these two we call this the backseat driver problem and we 're now focusing more on the informational so think of it as a monitor for the blind so it 's a small tablet has many holes in it and compressed air comes so it can actually draw images so even though you are blind you can put your hand over it you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles user interface so here you can see the left camera the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix for this we 're showing a simulator a blind person driving using the airpix world famous daytona international speedway during the rolex let 's take a look the the the so since we started this project we 've been getting hundreds of letters emails phone calls from people from all around the world letters thanking us but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one now i understand why there is braille on a but sometimes but sometimes i also do get i wouldn 't call it hate mail but letters of really strong concern dr hong are you insane trying to put blind people on the road you must be out of your mind would they accept such a radical idea how are we going to handle insurance how are we going to issue driver 's licenses there 's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality of course the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind but potentially more important than this is the the tremendous value of the spin off technology that the sensors that are used can see through the dark the we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people or for the blind everyday home appliances in the educational setting in the office setting just imagine in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student so today the things i 've showed you today is just the beginning thank you very much"
