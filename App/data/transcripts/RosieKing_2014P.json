  "transcript": "i haven 't told many people this but in my head i 've got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time i am also autistic people tend to diagnose he can 't talk at all but i love to talk people often associate autism with liking maths and science and nothing else but i know so many autistic people who love being creative the stereotypes of things are often if not always wrong for instance a lot of people think autism and think rain man immediately but that 's not just with autistic people either i 've seen it with lgbtq people with women with people are so afraid of variety i googled autistic people the first thing that people think when they think autism they know one of the things i can do because i 'm autistic it 's an ability rather than a disability is i 've got a very very vivid imagination like it 's very easy for me to let my mind loose because i don 't try and fit myself into a tiny little box that 's one of the best things about being autistic you don 't have the urge to do that you find what you want to do you find a way to do it and you get on with it school can be a problem in general but having also to explain to a teacher on a daily basis that their lesson is inexplicably dull and you are secretly taking refuge in a world inside your head in which you are not in that lesson that adds to your list of problems also when my imagination takes hold my body takes on a life of its own when something very but i 've done that ever since i was a child ever since i was a tiny little girl and my parents thought it was cute so they didn 't bring it up but when i got into school they didn 't really agree that it was cute and this doesn 't normally happen in this day and age but it can be that people don 't want to be friends with the autistic girl but that 's fine with me because it sorts the wheat from the chaff and i can find which people are genuine and true and i can pick these people as my friends but think about it what is normal imagine if that was the best compliment you ever received wow you are really normal but compliments are you are extraordinary or you step outside the box it 's you 're amazing so if people want be these things why are so many people striving to be normal why are people pouring their brilliant individual light into a mold people are so afraid of variety there are camps for lgbtq people or autistic people to try and make them this normal and that 's terrifying that people would do that in this day and age all in all i wouldn 't trade my autism and my imagination for the world because i am autistic i 've presented documentaries to the bbc i 'm in the midst of writing a book i 'm doing this this is fantastic and one of the best things that i 've achieved that i consider to have achieved is i 've found ways of communicating with my little brother and sister who as i 've said are nonverbal they can 't speak but that 's silly because my little brother and sister are the best siblings that you could ever hope for they 're just the best and i love them so much and i care about them more than anything else i 'm going to leave you with one question if we can 't get inside the person 's minds no matter if they 're autistic or not instead of punishing anything that strays from normal not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination thank you"
