  "transcript": "and i like to argue and i 'm not just an academic i 'm a and i 've come across some puzzles and one of the puzzles is that as i 've been thinking about arguing over the years and it 's been decades now but the more that i argue and the better i get at arguing and that 's a puzzle and the other puzzle is that i 'm actually okay with that why is it that i 'm okay with who benefits from arguments i 'm talking about let 's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments where something cognitive is at stake is this proposition true is this theory a good theory is and so on i 'm not interested really in arguments about whose turn it is to do the dishes or who we have those arguments too first what do good arguers win what do i win if i convince you that utilitarianism isn 't really the right framework for thinking about ethical even before that what does it matter to me whether you have this this idea that kant 's theory works or or mill is the right ethicist to follow it 's no skin off my back so why do we even try to argue why do we try to convince other people to believe things they don 't want to believe and is that even a nice thing to do is that a nice way to treat another human being try and make them think something they don 't want to think well you know what that 's like a lot of screaming and and shouting and winning and losing that 's not a very helpful model does it work is it any good are the premises does the conclusion follow from the premises no opposition no adversariality not necessarily any but there 's a third model to keep in mind that i think is and that is in front of an audience we can think of a politician trying to but there 's another twist on this model that i that i really think is important namely that when we argue that is arguments are also who make a judgment and decide the case let 's call this the rhetorical model where you have to tailor your argument you know presenting a sound well argued tight argument in english before a francophone audience just isn 't going to work so we have these models argument as war argument as proof and argument as performance of those three the argument as war is the dominant one we talk in a very militaristic language we want strong arguments arguments that have a arguments that are right on target we want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order we want it is the dominant way of thinking about arguments when i 'm talking about arguments that 's probably what you thought of the adversarial model first it elevates tactics over substance it magnifies the it 's polarizing and the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph glorious triumph ignominious defeat i think those are deforming effects and worst of all it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise or collaboration think about that one have you ever entered an argument thinking let 's see if we can what can we work out together i think the argument as war metaphor inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation and this is really the worst thing arguments don 't seem to get us anywhere they 're dead ends they are like roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock in conversation we don 't get anywhere then there 's an implicit equation of learning with losing and let me explain what i mean suppose you and i and i don 't and i say well and i object and say well what about and i have a question well what do you mean how does it apply over here and you answer my and in every case you 've responded i say you know what i guess you 're right p it 's cognitively maybe you get some professional status status in the field this guy 's a good arguer war metaphor forces us into thinking that you 're the winner and i lost even though and that 's the picture i really want to want to change if we can so how can we find ways to make arguments but we 're not going to have new exit strategies for arguments until we have new we need to think of new kinds of arguments in order to do that well it 's just taken up habitation in our mind what we need to do is think of new kinds of arguers so try this think of all the roles there 's the proponent and the opponent there 's the there 's the reasoner in in arguments as proofs all these different roles now can you imagine an argument can you imagine yourself and yet you do that i think you can and i think if you can imagine that kind of argument where the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say yeah that was a good argument and more than that i think you 've imagined a good arguer an arguer that 's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be now i lose a lot of arguments thank you"
