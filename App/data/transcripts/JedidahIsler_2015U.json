  "transcript": "my first love was for the night sky ultra deep field one of the most distant images of our universe ever comprised of billions of stars each as an astrophysicist i have the awesome privilege of studying some of the most exotic objects in our universe the objects that have captivated me from first crush throughout my career are supermassive hyperactive black holes weighing one to ten billion times the mass of our own sun these galactic black holes are devouring material at a rate of upwards of one thousand times more than your average supermassive black hole at the same i study these narrow streams called jets are moving at ninety nine point nine nine percent of the speed of light these jetted hyperactive and supermassive black holes are called so special is that they 're some of the universe 's most efficient particle accelerators transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy here i 'm showing an artist 's conception of a blazar the dinner plate by which material falls onto the black hole is called the accretion disc shown here in blue some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet shown here in white although the blazar system is rare the process by which nature pulls in material via a disk and then flings some of it out via a jet is more common we 'll eventually zoom out of the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context beyond the cosmic accounting accounting of what goes in to what goes out one of the hot topics in blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest energy jet emission comes from as a result there 's any relationship between the jet and the accretion disc material clear answers to this question were almost completely inaccessible until two thousand and eight when nasa launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light that is light with energies a million times higher than your standard x ray scan i simultaneously compare variations between the gamma ray light data and the visible light data from day to day and year to year to better localize these gamma ray my research shows that in some instances these blobs form much closer to the black hole than we initially thought as we more confidently localize where these gamma ray blobs are forming we can better understand how jets are being accelerated and ultimately reveal the dynamic processes by which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed this all started as a love story and it still is thank you"
