  "transcript": "there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives we don 't bump into every neighbor so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on though we do share the same public how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments how can we share more of our abandoned buildings and gain a better understanding of our landscape so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today now and i am in love with new orleans shading lovers drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years i feel like every time someone sneezes new orleans has a parade and i also thought about something that changed my life forever in two thousand and nine i lost someone i loved very much her name was joan and she was a mother to me and her death was sudden and unexpected and i thought about death a lot this made me feel deep gratitude for the time i 've had and but i struggle to maintain this perspective in my i turned the side of this abandoned house i want to so anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk reflect on their life and share their personal aspirations in public space but by the next day the wall was entirely filled out and i 'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall i want to be tried for piracy die i want to straddle the international dateline i want to sing for millions i want to plant a tree i want to hold her one more time i want to be someone 's cavalry i want to be completely myself so this neglected space became a constructive one and people 's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud and they consoled me during my own tough times it 's about knowing you 're not alone it 's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways it and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change i made this last so my civic center colleagues and i made a tool kit and beyond together we 've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we 're given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people in our age of increasing distractions it 's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender death is something that we 're often discouraged to talk about or even think about thinking about death clarifies your life fears and stories the people around us can not only help us make better places thank you"
