  "transcript": "perhaps we can use lewis carroll and look in the looking glass that is new york city or perhaps pass through to another world or in the words of f scott fitzgerald the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually i became aware of the old island here that once flowered for dutch sailors ' eyes a fresh green breast of the new world my colleagues and i have been working for ten years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project we 're trying to discover what henry hudson would have seen on the afternoon of september 12th one thousand six hundred and nine when he sailed into new york harbor and i 'd so act i a map found and from these early experiences as a child i learned to love and so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies i studied this emerging field of landscape ecology landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals this experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the wildlife conservation and over the last decade and i 'd look down on this landscape on these ecosystems and i 'd wonder how does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals how does it work to make habitat for animals like me and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them i started reading about the history and the geography in new i started seeing paintings like this for those of you who are from new york this is 125th street under the west side highway or this painting from the 1740s from greenwich village and i couldn 't find it and i couldn 't find that palm tree what 's that palm tree doing there so it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map and it 's this map you see here held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in this map isn 't from hudson 's time but from the american revolution one hundred and seventy years later made by british military cartographers during the occupation of new york city and if i zoom in to lower manhattan and this is city park so the city basically extended to city hall park and just beyond it you can see which was the fresh water source for new york city for its first two hundred years and for the native americans for thousands of years before that and the beaches that come up from the battery all the way to was made for military reasons they 're mapping the roads the buildings these fortifications that they built also military interest the hills the marshes or the the swamp at gramercy and i thought to myself i could find these lost features of the city and where they like to eat so that we can zoom in to where the collect pond is digitize the collect pond so this is fun for finding where things are and if we take away the if we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time we could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals to the hills to the streams the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape then if we added maps like the geology the what the glaciers leave if we make the soil map with the seventeen soil classes that are defined by the national conservation service if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were then we can calculate the slopes we can calculate the aspect we can calculate the winter wind exposure so we compiled all the information about where the native americans were the lenape and we built a probability map of where they might have been so the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on manhattan places that are close to water places that are near the harbor to fish places protected from the winter winds we know that there was a lenape settlement down here by the collect pond and the old fields the successional fields that go and we might think of these as abandoned but in fact they 're grassland habitats for grassland birds and and plants and these then mix and it turns out that manhattan had fifty five different ecosystem types you can think of these as neighborhoods as distinctive as tribeca and the upper east side and inwood that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities the beaches and fifty five is a than amboseli so we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees the heath hens the species that aren 't there anymore the black bears and the native americans to study how they used and thought about their landscape where do they get their reproductive resources so we would read in field guides the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves you know so we just started making a list here is the beaver and here is the stream and the aspen and the alder and the willow or the bog turtle needing wet or the bobcat needing rabbits and beavers and den sites but a beaver also needs things and that having it on either side means that we can link it together that we can create the network of the habitat we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist but you can look up what an aspen needs an aspen needs fire and dry soils and it need beavers to create the wetlands and maybe some other things but you can also talk about sunny places so what does a sunny place need not habitat per se but what are the conditions that make it possible or dry soils and that you can put these on a grid that and if you zoom in on it it looks like this each point is a different species species or a different stream or a different soil type and those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together they are we call these muir webs after the scottish american naturalist john muir who said when we try to pick out anything by itself we find that it 's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken to everything in the universe so then we took the muir webs and we took them back to the maps so if we wanted to go between and the flowers the butterflies the fish in the stream the birds in the trees maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there and then we took this data and we used it to try and reveal a landscape and we tried to use it to visualize third avenue so we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography we 'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters and illuminate the landscape and feed into that the map of the species so that we would actually take a photograph flying above times square looking toward the hudson river waiting for hudson to come using this technology we can make these fantastic georeferenced views we can basically take a picture this is the view looking down the hudson river with manhattan on the left and new jersey out on the right looking out toward the atlantic ocean with the beaver pond there looking out toward the east these images and i 'd just like if you would give him a hand to call out for his fine work there is such power in bringing science and visualization together that we can create images like and even though i 've only had a brief time to speak you appreciate that mannahatta was a very special place the place that you see here on the left side was interconnected it was based on this diversity it had this resilience but i wouldn 't have you think that i i don 't like the place on the right which i quite do i 've come to love the city and its kind of on density and how we 're connected together in fact that i see them as reflections of each other much as lewis carroll did in through the looking glass we can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time that they really are the same place that there is no way that cities can escape from nature and i think this is what what we 're learning about building cities in the not about the past but about four hundred years from now reproductive resources and so many of the talks here at ted are about about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways through technology through art through science so much so that i think we focus so much on that side of our lives that we haven 't given enough attention to and what we need to raise the kids well what if we go to madison square park and we imagine it without all the cars and streams instead of sewers and storm drains and streams winding through the city or if we imagine the new york city metropolitan area currently home to twelve million people but twelve million people in the future perhaps living at the density of manhattan covered by the marshes we need"
