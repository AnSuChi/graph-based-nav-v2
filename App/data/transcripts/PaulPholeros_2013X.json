  "transcript": "the idea of eliminating poverty is a great goal i don 't think anyone in this room would disagree what worries me is when politicians with money and charismatic rock stars use the words it all just sounds so so simple now i 've got no bucket of money today but i do have an idea and that idea is called housing for health and the work is done to improve their health over the last twenty eight years this tough grinding dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people more recently overseas and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments i 'm going to start where the story began one thousand nine in central australia a man called yami lester an aboriginal man was running a health service percent of what walked in the door in terms of illness was infectious disease he got a medical doctor a team of local aboriginal people yami told us at that first meeting there 's no money and i want you to start on a project which in his language he called uwankara palyanku kanyintjaku a plan to stop people getting sick a profound brief that was our task and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals what were we aiming at and preferably a lot of them this didn 't fit the bill what i didn 't see and what you can 't see was that he 'd assembled thousands of pages of local national and international health research the pictures that came a bit later had a very simple reason the aboriginal people who were our bosses and the senior people so the story had to be told in pictures of so we had the goals and each one of these goals and i won 't go through them all puts at the center the person and their health issue and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their particularly children and i 'm going to ask you all a very personal question this morning before you came who could have had a wash using a shower i 'm not going to ask if you had a shower because i 'm too polite i want you all to select one of the houses of the twenty five houses you see on the screen i want you to select one of them and note the position of that house and keep that in your head let 's see if your shower in that house house is working i hear some aw and i hear some ah if you get a green tick your shower 's working you and your kids are fine if you get a red cross i know that 's going to come as a shock to some of you but you are and before you get offended and leave the chest and the skin that if they occur in the first five years of life permanently damage which we originally thought needing dialysis at age forty this is a big deal so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids those ticks and crosses represent the seven thousand eight hundred houses we 've looked at nationally around australia the same proportion what you see on the screen thirty five percent of those not so famous houses lived in by fifty thousand indigenous people thirty five percent had a working shower ten percent of those same seven thousand eight hundred houses had safe electrical systems and fifty eight percent of those houses had a working toilet these are by a simple does it have hot and cold water two taps that work and a drain that takes the water away not not beautiful not elegant just that they function and the same tests for the electrical system and the toilets housing for health projects aren 't about measuring failure they 're actually about improving houses trades and we train up a local team on the first day to start by the evening of the first day a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning that work continues for six to twelve months until all the houses are improved and we 've spent our budget of seven thousand five hundred dollars total per house that 's our average budget it 's very difficult to improve the function of all those parts of the house and for a whole house we test check and fix two hundred and fifty items in every house we can get showers up to eighty six percent working we can get electrical systems up to seventy seven percent working and we can get ninety percent of toilets working in those seven i think there 's an obvious question why are the houses in such poor seventy percent of the work we do is due to lack of routine maintenance the sort of things that happen in all our houses things wear out should have been done by state government or local government simply not done the house doesn percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction literally things that are built upside down and back to front they don 't work we have to fix them the final cause will have heard always that indigenous people trash houses it 's one of the almost pieces of evidence which i 've never seen evidence for we argue strongly that the people living in the house are simply not the problem and we 'll go a lot further than that the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution seventy five percent of our national team in australia over seventy five at the minute are actually local indigenous people from the communities we work in they do all aspects of the work in two thousand and ten for example all over australia and the torres strait islands all states working to improve the houses where they and their families live and that 's an important thing the developing world bug trachoma causes blindness it and yet the picture you see behind is in an aboriginal community in the late percent of school aged kids had active trachoma in their eyes doing damage ok what do we do first thing we do we get showers working why because that flushes the bug out we put washing facilities in the school as well so kids can wash their faces many times during the day we wash the bug out second the and he came out and within a day it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground the wind driven dust so we used dirt we tested and we reduced the dust we call up the doctor of flies and yes there is a doctor of flies as our aboriginal mate said you white fellows ought to get out more and the doctor of flies very quickly determined that he could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide they could trap the flies send them to him in perth when the bug was in the gut he 'd send back by return post some dung beetles the dung beetles ate the camel dung the flies died through lack of food and finally you get a good eye all these small health gains and small pieces of the puzzle make a big difference the new south wales department of health that radical organization did an independent trial over three years to look at ten years of the work we 've been doing in these sorts of projects in new south wales and they found a forty percent reduction in hospital admissions for the illnesses that you could attribute to the poor environment a forty percent just to show that the principles we 've used in australia can be used in other places i 'm just going to go to one other place and that 's nepal and what a beautiful place to go we were asked by a small village of six hundred people to go in and make toilets where none existed health was poor we went in with no grand plan no grand promises of a great program it was during the design of the first toilet green timber the smoke coming off that timber is choking and in an enclosed house you so all of a sudden we had two problems we were there smokeless and free for the family i put it to you is and the answer from the nepali team who 's working at the minute would say don 't be ridiculous we have three million more toilets to build before we can even make but as we all sit here today he 's a young he 's got significantly less gut infection she 's probably right now cooking lunch for her family he puts it on his crops he 's trebled his crop income more food for the family and more money for the family and finally bishnu the leader of the team has now understood that not only have we built toilets we 've also built and that to me is the key we 've never found that the problem poor living environment none of those are limited by geography by skin color or by religion none of them the common link between all the work we 've had to do is one thing and that 's poverty nelson mandela said in the mid 2000s not too far from here he said that like slavery and apartheid poverty is not natural it is man made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings i want to end by saying it 's been the actions of that have actually improved health thank you very much for your"
