  "transcript": "when i was seven years old some well meaning adult asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up proudly perhaps something like the next albert einstein i have always loved math and science later coding and so i decided to study computer programming in college it was the first computer animation any of had ever seen i watched these films in wonder transfixed fireworks going off in my head thinking that is what i want to do with my life the idea that all the math science and code i had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories i connected with was pure magic for me pixar animation it was here i learned how we actually execute those films to create our movies we create a three dimensional world inside the computer we start with a point that makes a line that makes a face that creates characters or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest i was fascinated by all of it but then i got my first taste of lighting but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work in rough form it might look like this and in final form like this there 's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it it 's where we go from this to this it 's the moment where all the pieces come together and suddenly the world comes to life as if it 's an actual place that exists as i learned to light i learned about using light to help tell story to set the time of day to create the mood how to make a character look appealing or stand out in a busy set did you see wall e there he is we can make a world with monsters we can even make pigs fly it can create unbelievable worlds unbelievable movement things that are jarring to the audience we use science and the world we know as a backbone ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable but how do you make it look underwater in early research and development we took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look one of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water and then what happens with the color we lose the red wavelengths then the green wavelengths leaving us with blue at the far depths in this clip you can see two other important elements the first is the surge and swell the second is the caustics these are the ribbons of light like you might see on the bottom of a pool that are created when the sun bends through the crests of the ripples and waves on the ocean 's surface here we have the fog beams these give us color depth cues but also tells which direction is up in shots where we don 't see the water surface the lending a subtle magical sparkle to the underwater you can see how we 're using the science the physics of water light and movement to tether that but we are not beholden to it we considered each of these elements and which ones had to be scientifically accurate and which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood but here we can take sydney harbor and push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what 's happening so we understand what the east we use science to create something wonderful we got so geeked out on making wall e this convincing robot that we made his binoculars practically optically we started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections he was starting to look so we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars we have a concave lens and a convex lens and here you see all three together showing us all these we tried blocking them nothing was working and then we have our eureka moment we add a light to wall e that accidentally leaks into his eyes you can see it light up these gray aperture blades the colored iris and the black pupil wall e feels like he has a soul like there 's a character with emotion inside later in the movie towards the end wall e loses his personality essentially going dead this is the perfect time to bring back that we bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back and he returns to that sweet soulful robot we 've come to love wall e there 's a beauty in these unexpected moments when the jellyfish in finding nemo was one of those moments for me there are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together this was one of those scenes the reviews with the director turned from the normal look and feel conversation into more and more questions about numbers and percentages the science without the art that scientific tether was i dug in as i worked to balance the blues and the pinks the caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells the undulating fog beams and then i showed it to the lighting director and she got excited i was showing to the director in a dark room full of fifty people and i played the jellyfish scene and the director was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time this is doomed this it 's this interweaving of art and science that elevates the world to a place of wonder a place with soul a place we can believe in a place where the things you imagine can become real thank you"
