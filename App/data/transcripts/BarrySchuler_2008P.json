  "transcript": "what 's happening in genomics and how this revolution and how we how we think and you saw the monolith you know that was arthur c clarke 's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species in this case it was picking up bones and creating a tool using it as a tool which meant that apes just sort of running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they and that moved us to the next level and you know we in the last thirty years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools and we 've seen many seminal moments we 've seen the creation of small computers and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably twenty in your home and in not just your p c but in every device in your washing machine your cell phone you 're walking around your car has twelve microprocessors then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together we flatten the world we 've seen so much change and we 've given ourselves these tools now and that is a genome how 's your genome today have you thought about it lately heard about it at least you i thought i 'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is i really don 't understand so i will tell you right off of the bat you 've heard of dna you probably studied a little bit in biology a genome is really a description for all of the dna that is in a living organism and one thing that is common to all of life is dna doesn 't matter whether you 're a yeast it doesn 't matter whether you 're a mouse doesn 't matter whether you 're a fly call them and when watson and crick in the ' 50s first decoded this double helix that we know as the dna molecule very long complicated molecule we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that dna is a language that determines the characteristics our traits what we inherit what diseases we may get we 've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule that all of the dna in your body has been around since the beginning of us of us as creatures there is a historical archive living in your genome is the history of our species and you as an individual human being where you 're from going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years and that 's now starting to be understood it is what makes you function it is what makes every organism function it 's long and it 's complicated really all you have to know about it is that there 's four letters a t and very complicated things you know they are generally put together in pairs and you and that may not sound very intuitive but let me flip over to something else you know about and that 's computers look at this screen here and you know you see pictures and you see words but really all there are are ones and zeros everything that happens in digital is converted or a representation of a one and a zero so when you 're listening to it 's all ones and zeros and when you 're talking on your telephone your cell phone and it 's going over the network your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we 've been able to create with just a one and a zero well now you ramp that up to four and you have a lot of complexity a lot of ways to describe so let 's talk about what that means so if you look at a human they consist of three point two billion of these base pairs that 's a lot and they mix up in all different fashions and that makes you a human being if you convert that to binary just to give you a little bit of sizing we 're actually smaller than the program microsoft office i will also tell you we 're at least as buggy this here is a bug in my genome it is in fact many many diseases we have struggled with for for a long which means well let 's just throw chemicals at it and maybe it 's going to make it work but if you really understand why does a cell go from normal what is the code what are the exact instructions that are making it do that then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out so for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine here 's a few factoids for you we actually have about twenty four thousand genes that do things we have about a hundred one hundred and twenty thousand others that don 't appear to function every day but represent this archival you might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes they recently sequenced pinot noir and it also has about thirty thousand genes now look around just look next to your neighbor look forward look backward we all look pretty different a lot of very handsome and pretty people here skinny chubby different races cultures we are now able to read genomes the first human genome took ten years three billion dollars it was done by craig venter and then james watson 's one of the of dna genome was done for two million dollars and in just two months and if you think about the computer industry and how we 've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about five thousand dollars in about an hour or and what that means is you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card it will be here you won 't be buying a drug that 's used for everybody you will give your genome to the pharmacist and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were you won 't have side effects all those side effects you know forget about that they 're going to make all that stuff go away what does a genome look like if you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this but what scientists are doing now is they 're understanding assuming this is a grape plant make a root make a branch create a blossom in a human being down in here it could be make blood cells start cancer for me it may be every calorie you consume you conserve because i come from a very cold climate for my wife eat three times as much and you never put on any it 's all hidden in this code and it 's starting to be understood at breakneck pace what can we do with genomes now that we can read them now that we 're starting to have the book of life well there 's many things some are exciting some people will find very scary i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me but that 's okay functionality this is really important we can understand for example why we create plaque in our arteries why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide we can also look at at a grander scale what creates problems what creates disease and how we may be able because we can understand this we can fix them make better organisms most importantly what we 're learning is that nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox the toolbox exists an architect far better better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox and we now now have the ability to use it we are writing them this company synthetic genomics i 'm involved with created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug a very primitive creature called mycoplasma genitalium if you have a uti you 've probably or ever had a uti you you 've come in contact with this little bug very simple only has about two hundred we were able to completely synthesize that genome now you have the genome and you say to yourself so if i plug this synthetic genome if i pull the old one out and plug it in does it just boot up and live well guess what it does not only does it do that if you took the genome that synthetic genome and you plugged it into a different critter like yeast you now turn that yeast into mycoplasma it 's sort of like booting up a pc with a mac o s software well actually you could do it the other way so you know and this is extremely last year the french and italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced pinot noir the genomic sequence now exists for the entire pinot noir organism and they have discovered pathways that create flavors they 've also discovered that there 's a heck of a lot of they 've identified areas of vulnerability to disease they now are understanding and the work is going on exactly how this plant works and we have the capability to know to read that entire code and understand how it ticks so then what do you do knowing that we can read it knowing that we can write it change it maybe write its genome from scratch one thing you could do is what some people might call franken noir we can build a better vine by the way just so you know you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified they 're not grown from seeds they 're grafted into root stock focus on disease we could conceivably expand the climate window we could make pinot noir grow maybe in long island god forbid we could produce better flavors flavors and aromas you want a little more raspberry a little more chocolate here or there all of these things could conceivably be done and i will tell you i 'd pretty much bet in fact i 'm sorry to inform you that inside of your digestive tract is about ten pounds of microbes which you 're circulating through your body quite a bit our ocean 's teaming with microbes in fact when craig venter venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all new microbes in the first twenty feet of water we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating co2 and oxygen than plants do which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere we find microbial life in every part of the planet in ice coal in rocks in volcanic vents it 's an amazing thing it is the ecosystem around them it is the microbes that live in their root systems that have just as much impact on the character of if you take a closer look at a root system you will find there are many many many diverse microbial colonies this is not big news to viticulturists they have been you know you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in you don 't necessarily know with granularity exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and and what characteristics wow is my terroir great it 's so special i 've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn 't believe well you know we really we argue and debate about it we say it 's climate it 's soil it 's this well guess what we can figure out what the heck terroir is it 's in there waiting to be sequenced there they 're easy to sequence unlike a human they you know have a thousand two thousand genes we can figure out what they are all we have to do is go around and sample correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don 't like that 's just a big database and then fertilize and then we understand what is terroir so some people will say oh my god are we playing god are we now if we engineer you know people would always ask james watson he 's not always the most politically correct guy and they would say are you know are you playing god and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question well somebody has to i consider myself a very spiritual the organized religion part and i will tell you i don 't believe there 's anything unnatural i told you i 'm going to make some of you puke but we don 't make anything unnatural we can create bad impacts we can poison ourselves we can poison the earth but that 's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made and we find that this toolbox is very extensive there are microbes out there that actually make gasoline believe it or not there are microbes you know go back to yeast these are chemical factories the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by nature and we now can use those there also is a set of rules nature will not allow you to we could engineer a grape plant but guess what we can 't make the grape plant produce babies nature has put a set of rules out there we can work within the rules we can 't break the rules we 're just learning what the rules are i just ask the if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious healthy plants that grow in in very hard to grow environments if we could create clean and plentiful energy we right in the labs at synthetic genomics have single celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline you end up with a lipid that if we working with this tool set that we now understand if you can stay healthy for twenty years you 'll see one hundred and fifty maybe three hundred"
