  "transcript": "a few years ago my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis knees and toes swelled up causing crippling chronic pain i 'm not a doctor so what i am is a historian of medicine so i started to research the history an entire history of pain collection in their archives and i found a story people like my mom yet i had never heard of him there were no biographies of him no hollywood the circus had just arrived in the tiny town of brookfield new york they also came to a brawny bully who 'd pin you for a dollar you know on that particular day a voice rang out over the circus p a system they needed a doctor urgently in the live animal tent something had gone wrong with the lion tamer the climax of his act had gone wrong and his head was stuck inside the lion 's mouth the crowd watched in horror as he struggled and then when the lion finally did relax its jaws the lion tamer just when he came to a few minutes later it was bull walker the strongman had given the lion tamer and saved his life now the strongman hadn 't told anyone but he was actually a third year medical student but kept it a secret to protect his persona he was supposed to be a brute a villain not a nerdy do gooder his medical colleagues didn 't know his secret either as he put it if you were an athlete you were a dumb dodo so he didn 't tell them about the circus or he used a pseudonym like bull walker or later the masked marvel he even kept it a secret that same year when he was crowned the light heavyweight champion of the world he was a doctor he was a hero and he treated it and he didnt know he 'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain but that all happened later whom he had met at one of his matches years before he had to his internship at new york 's st vincent 's hospital paid nothing with his championship belt he wrestled in he tore hip joints fractured ribs one night the terrible turk 's big toe scratched a scar like capone 's down the side of his face the next morning he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it twice bonica showed up to the o r with one eye so bruised he couldn 't see out of it but worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears he said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head next he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital heaved and pushed clearly in anguish her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain irritated emma 's throat she vomited and choked and saved his wife and his unborn daughter he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology but showed up to madigan army medical center near tacoma at seven thousand seven hundred beds it was one of the largest army hospitals in america bonica was in charge of all pain control there everything he had learned pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell in a good way a body 's way of signaling an injury like a broken arm like after a patient had a leg amputated that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg but if the injury had been treated why would the alarm bell keep ringing and yet still the patient hurt others and he tried to get their opinions on his patients it took too long so he started organizing group meetings over lunch it would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient 's pain no one had ever focused on pain this way before after that he hit the books he read every medical textbook he could get his hands on carefully noting every mention of the word pain out of the fourteen thousand pages he read the word seventeen and a half of them seventeen and a half for the most basic most common most frustrating part of being a patient bonica was shocked i 'm quoting him he said what the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there the most important thing from the patient 's perspective they don 't talk about so over the next eight years bonica would talk about it he 'd write about it he 'd write those missing pages he wrote what would later be known as the bible of pain in it he proposed new strategies new treatments using nerve block injections he proposed a new institution the pain clinic based on those the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine a desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously in patients ' lives the goal wasn 't to make patients better it was to make patients feel better he pushed his pain agenda for decades before it finally took hold in the but as they did bonica 's years of wrestling caught up to him he had been out of the ring for over twenty years but those hundred professional bouts had left a mark on his body still in his mid 50s he suffered severe osteoarthritis and hip replacement after hip replacement he could barely raise his arm he needed aluminum crutches to walk his friends and former students became his doctors one recalled that already a workaholic he worked healing others became more than just his job it was his own most effective form of relief if i wasn 't as busy as i am he told a reporter at the time i would be a completely disabled guy on a business trip to florida in the early 1980s bonica got a former student to drive him to the hyde park area in tampa they drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion with the house belonged to the zacchini family who were something like american circus royalty doing the act they pioneered but now they were like him including bonica so there 's no way to know exactly what they said that day but maybe bonica gave them medical advice maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history which is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life bonica saw pain close up he felt it he lived it played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself in that same oral history bonica claimed that pain that it involves your your interactions your family was definitely true for bonica but it was also true for my mom it 's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of but as i saw bonica 's pain a testament to his fully lived life i started to remember all the things that my mom 's pain holds before they got swollen and arthritic my mom 's fingers when i was a kid they cut my hair"
