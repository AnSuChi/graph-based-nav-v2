  "transcript": "to be a cyborg one of my favorite shows as a kid was the six million dollar man swallowing swords on stage here so i figure it 's ok amongst this group but and the power that i see inherent in them when i was a kid i attended montessori school up to sixth grade in atlanta georgia and at the time i didn 't think much about it but then later i realized that that was the high point of my education from that point on everything else was pretty much downhill and it wasn 't until later as i started making games that i really actually think of them more as toys people call me a game designer but i really think of these things more as toys i started getting very interested in maria montessori and her methods and the way she went about things and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly and she would design these where kids in playing with the toys would come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play and since they discovered this and i really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles and that 's the way i work i get interested in different subjects i dive in research them and then try to figure out how to craft a toy around that so that other people can experience the same sense of discovery that i did as i was learning that subject and then drake 's equation looking at the probability of life arising on planets how long it might last how many planets are out there i started looking at how interesting drake 's equation was because it spanned all these different subjects economics astronomy and as it exists and as it might go in the future things where you might the fermi the origin of life as kind of a philosophy toy playing this toy will bring up philosophical questions in you it occurs at all these different scales from very small to very large swimming around but it helps to make it cute the players are going to play through every generation of this species play the game the creature is actually growing bit by bit and then we start interacting with larger and larger organisms and one thing that 's kind of important about this game is that at every level survive and then reproduce you know very darwinian one thing we noticed with the sims even if it wasn 't as pretty as professional artist would make for games it really stuck with them and they really cared about what would happen to it at this point we 've left the water and now with this little creature we could bring up the volume a little bit and now we might try to eat we might sneak up on this little guy over play through every generation of this creature we actual evolution with humans and all that because it 's almost more interesting to look at alternate now once we mate and this is where the game starts getting interesting because so that for very little effort the player can make something very cool so it has a little spine i can move around i can extend i can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel so you sculpt it like clay we have parts here that i can put on or pull off the idea is that the player can basically design and in this case i might decide i 'm going to put i 'll put mouths on the limbs so pretty much players are encouraged to be very so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something that they didn 't really think was possible before this is almost like designing something like maya that an eight year old can but really the goal here was within about a minute i wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create ok now i 'll put some hands on it ok so that 's the complete model now we can actually go to the painting phase at this phase the program has some understanding of the topology of this creature it knows where the backbone and see how it would move around it 's looking at whatever i 've designed it will actually bring it to life and i can see how it might dance it pose for a photo snap a little photo of it so then i bring this back into the game it 's born and i play the next generation of my creature through evolution it 's automatically sent up to a server and then redistributed to all the other players transparently so in fact as i 'm interacting in this world with other creatures and pretty much everything you 're going to see there 's an editor for that the player can create up through civilization this is eventually they would go out into space and really in some sense i want the players to be and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain so that 's kind of what these tools are about how do we make the gameplay basically the player 's imagination amplifier so this is the planet that we 've been playing on up to this point in the game so far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here at this point we 're actually dealing with a very little toy planet what could they discover what might they learn on this this world was actually extracted from the player 's imagination so this is the planet that the player evolved on things like the buildings the vehicles the architecture civilizations so here 's a little city with some of our guys walking around in it and most games put the player in the role this protagonist playing through this story this is more about putting the player in the role of george lucas i want them after they 've played this game to have extracted an entire world that they 're now interacting with as we pull down here we still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet all these different dynamics going on here i can look over here and this is a little simplified food web that 's going on with the creatures i can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface you get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in but there 's a very simple calculation of what 's required how many plants are required for the herbivores to live how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat etc that you have to balance actively so i can come in and i can do things and just treat this planet as a lump of clay we have very simple weather systems simple geology for instance i could open one of my tools here and so that 's what i 'm doing here there 's actually a little readout down there of our planetary atmosphere pressure and temperature as i start pumping in more atmosphere we 're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here and if you 'll start noticing we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time so there goes one city i can speed it up see the heat impact of that as well not only will it get hotter but at some point it 's going to get so hot the oceans will evaporate that actually brings up an interesting point about games now here our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet is going to melt down here it goes so we 're not only simulating and what 's interesting to me about games is that i think we can take a lot of long term dynamics and compress them into very using the game to remap our intuition so here 's our little solar system as we pull we actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system let 's fly to another one we 're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can explore here as we move into the future and we start going out into space and doing stuff we 're drawing a lot from things like science fiction and all my favorite science fiction movies i want to play out here as different dynamics this planet actually has some life on it here it is some indigenous life down here one of the tools i eventually earn for my ufo is a monolith that i can drop down now and over time once they touch it they will become intelligent so i can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient now they 've actually gone to tribal dynamics and now because i 'm actually the one here i can get out of the ufo and walk up and they should be worshipping me at this at first they 're a little freaked out ok well maybe they 're not worshipping me i think i 'll leave before they get hostile but we basically want a diversity of activities the players can play through this from this world two dimensionally and so static as we pull away from the star here we 're actually going now out into interstellar space and we 're getting a sense of the space around our home star what i really wanted to do is to present this so most people have no idea of the difference between an emission nebula and a planetary i want to basically have the entire zoo of hubble objects that people can interact with kind of slowly in motion it 's always beautiful photos but they 're always static and when you bring it forward in time and start animating it it 's amazing what a galaxy would would be about a million years a second because you have about one supernova part of this is about bringing the beauty of the natural world to somebody in a very imaginative way so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time conquesting because you actually can do that you can attack other intelligent races you might be a networking god building alliances or just curious going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can but the reason why i make toys like this is because i think if there 's one difference i could possibly make in the world that i would choose to make it 's that i would like to somehow give people just a little bit better calibration on long term thinking because i think most of the problems that our world is facing right now and i think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics what it 's going to be like in one hundred years and so that 's why i think that toys can change the world"
