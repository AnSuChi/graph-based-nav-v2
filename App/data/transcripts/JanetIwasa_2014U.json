  "transcript": "and i 've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings they 're usually referred to as a model figure a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs this particular drawing is of a process called and it 's mainly in what it doesn 't show from lots of experiments from lots of different scientists we know a lot and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment kirchhausen we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that so we start outside of the cell now we 're looking inside clathrin are through connections with a membrane clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble or a vesicle that 's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell and so proteins are coming in now we 've covered them yellow and orange that are responsible for taking apart this and so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the hiv virus gets into and out of cells and again this is a vast oversimplification and doesn 't begin to show what we actually know about these processes because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really i spent months in hollywood learning 3d animation software and i spend months on each animation and that 's just time that most researchers can 't afford and i 'm working on a new project now called the science of hiv where i 'll be animating the entire life cycle of the hiv virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail the animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades data on what this virus looks like how it 's able to infect cells in our body and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection but they 're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study and with the data we have now that 's just not good enough anymore the process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas one researcher i worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were and in this way animation can feed back into the research process but for that change to happen we need more researchers creating animations and toward that end i brought together a team of biologists animators and programmers to create a new free open source software we call it molecular flipbook that 's created just for biologists just to create molecular animations thank you"
