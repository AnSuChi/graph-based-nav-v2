  "transcript": "to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service and then in two thousand and three i started parikrma humanity foundation from my kitchen table the first thing that we did was walk through the slums we couldn 't go to all the identified houses we talked to the parents tried to convince them we played with the children and came and but the numbers hit us then two hundred million children between four to fourteen that should be going to school but do not million children who go to school but cannot read one hundred and twenty five million who cannot ninety percent of it was spent on teachers ' salary and administrators ' salary and yet india has nearly the the highest teacher absenteeism in the in the world with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year those numbers were absolutely and we were constantly asked when will you start how many schools will you start children will you get how are you going to scale how are you going to replicate we want to take one child at a time and get them we started parikrma the first parikrma school started in a slum where there were seventy thousand people living our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums a second story building the only second story building inside the slums and that rooftop did not have any ceiling only half a tin sheet that was our first school one hundred sixty five children indian academic year begins in june so june it rains so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof waiting for the rain to stop my god what a bonding exercise that was and all of us that were under that roof are still here together today the fourth school and a junior college in six years now we have four schools very simple to send each of these kids get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully contented in this you have to talk english but they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak english well no one in their family has spoken english no one in their generation has spoken english i like those books because they have something special in them the vocabulary used in those even if it takes me four and a half hours girl that you saw and this little boy has been coming to school for five years but isn 't it strange that little boys all but he has done a lot of research through google search when we started with our english medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible the icse curriculum and again there were people who laughed at me and said don 't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students they 'll never be able to cope but they excel in it you should just come across to see how well our children do there is also this myth that parents from they 'd much rather put them to work that 's absolute hogwash all parents all over the world but they need to believe that change is possible we have eighty percent attendance for all our fathers have started to attend it 's very interesting when we started our the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register now they have started writing their signature the children have taught them it 's amazing how much children can teach we have a few months ago actually late last year we had a few mothers who came to us and said you know we want to learn how to read and write can you teach us so we started an afterschool for our parents for our mothers we had twenty five mothers who came regularly after school to we want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools we have to send the fathers to de addiction labs we have to find we have about three three fathers who have been trained to cook we have we have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children they do a very good job because but most importantly this is the first they have got respect and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile more than ninety percent of staff are all parents and extended families we 've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming there is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream take a look at this little girl who was one of the twenty eight children from all privileged schools best schools in the country that was selected for the duke university talent identification program and was sent to iim ahmedabad it was such a pride for us after this ahmedabad trip i 've been i don 't even mingle or start speaking with someone so and today she wants to be a neurologist our children are doing brilliantly in sports inter school athletic competition that is held every year every year in bangalore where five thousand children participate from one hundred and forty best schools in the city and our children are coming back home with bags full of medals lots of admirers and friends we also have we have professors from mit experiments much beyond the classroom art music are considered we also believe that it 's the content not the toilets not the libraries but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important creating an environment of learning of inquiry of exploration is what is true education when we started parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking we didn 't hire mckinsey to do a business plan but we we know for sure that what we want to do today is is take one child at a time not get bogged with numbers and actually see the child complete the circle of life and unleash his total but we began with the idea of one child at a time five year old parusharam he was begging by a bus stop a few years ago got picked up and he has learned how to speak english we have a model by which kids can speak english and understand english in three month 's time he can tell you stories in english of the thirsty and if you ask him i like playing and if you ask him what he wants to do he will say i want to horsing now horsing is going for a horse ride so parusharam comes to my office every day he comes for a tummy rub because he believes that will give me luck began with the idea of"
