  "transcript": "i am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine my lab at the swiss federal institute of technology focuses on spinal cord injury affects more than fifty thousand people around the world whose life literally shatters in a matter of a handful of seconds christopher reeve has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured i still remember chris addressed us the scientists and i want you to stop by the rehabilitation center and when you go home think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better this was more than ten years ever since my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury they completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord complete and permanent paralysis of the leg but as observed the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber and while this certainly remained the key for a cure this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me i had to think about the problem differently it turned out that more than one hundred years of research starting with the nobel prize that contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion but because input from the brain is interrupted we awaken this network where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted i was and responded with a grin grin why don 't you try and i promise to you this was such an important moment in my career when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas i 'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated the locomotor system is a car the engine is turned off how could we re engage the engine first we have to provide the fuel replace this missing input provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk for this i leveraged twenty years of past research in neuroscience first to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation so here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation it took many years but eventually we developed an electrochemical here what i call the spinal brain cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle i was the steering system was missing and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg with this in mind we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in 200 gram rat the robot is transparent just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure the electrochemical enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks the robot fine swiss chocolate laughter actually the first results were very very very disappointing here is my best physical therapist and whenever she decided initiated full weight bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards this is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis in fact initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground they could even adjust leg movement for example to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase i can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory but the remaining question this novel training paradigm some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury this blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron where we observed yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury and there is a very important message they are the result of a young team of this is truly a we are creating the next generation of m d ' i am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony now i am sure you are all wondering this is certainly not a cure but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people 's quality of life i would like you all imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury we will implant an electrode array a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement this defines a personalized electrochemical that will enable locomotion and my hope is that after several months of training there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot my hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition and this is a radically new concept what i termed i implanted throughout the nervous system based on no to help the brain help this enticed your imagination because i can promise to you but when thank you"
