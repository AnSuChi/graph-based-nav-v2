  "transcript": "and i worry that investors aren 't paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change especially when it comes to sustainability i mean the really juicy things like environmental and social issues and here 's something that may surprise you the balance of power to really influence sustainability rests with institutional investors the large investors like pension funds we have a population that 's both growing and aging we have seven billion souls today heading to ten billion at the end we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change but that 's not all they 're economic issues and that makes them relevant to risk and and they are really complex and they can seem really far off that the temptation may be to do this bury our heads in the sand and not think about it resist this if you can don 't do this at home laughter but it makes me wonder if the investment rules of today we know they look at financial data metrics like sales growth cash flow market share valuation you know the really sexy stuff but they 're not enough investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call waste just making efficient uses of resources social includes human capital things like employee engagement and innovation capacity as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights and governance relates to the of companies by their boards and investors see i told you this is the really juicy stuff but esg is the measure of sustainability and sustainable investing incorporates esg factors with financial factors into the investment process it means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet and it means providing capital to users so if sustainability matters financially today and all signs indicate more tomorrow is the private sector paying attention well the really cool thing is that most ceos are they started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success about eighty percent of global ceos see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation but ninety three percent see esg as the future or as important to the future of their so how are companies actually leveraging esg to drive hard business results one example is near and dear to our hearts in two thousand and twelve state street migrated fifty four applications to the cloud environment and we retired another eighty five and we completed numerous automation projects and avoid the emissions of a one hundred thousand metric tons of carbon that 's the equivalent of taking twenty one thousand industrial conglomerate and about a decade ago they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds in a water business that 's a really big bet why did they do that well with apologies to the home improvement fans there 's more growth in water than in power tools energy and water now i mean come on really do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially the answer that may surprise you the data shows that stocks with better esg performance perform just as well as others in blue we see the msci world it we see a subset of companies rated as having the best esg performance no performance we want more i want more in some cases there may be outperformance from esg we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management so yes this is correlation so wouldn 't this be the norm are investors particularly institutional investors engaged well some are and a few are really at the vanguard hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in australia with assets of twenty two billion [ dollars ] so incorporating it into the investment process is core to their duty to act in the best interest of fund members core to their duty you gotta love the aussies right calpers is the pension fund for public employees in california now they 're moving toward one hundred percent sustainable investment by systematically integrated esg across the entire fund why full stop in their own words long term value creation requires the effective management of three forms of capital financial and physical this is why we are concerned with esg often i hear we are required to maximize returns so we don 't do that here or we don 't want to use the portfolio to make policy statements give the profits to charities me clarify something right here they 're compatible so i 'm not talking about tradeoffs here they hold the key the answer quite simply is they have the money the global bond market seventy eight so we can reconsider some of these pressing challenges like fresh water clean air feeding ten billion mouths if institutional investors integrated esg into investment what if they used that firepower to more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges or at least not exacerbating them what if we only to find that the world we retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is now what if there isn 't enough clean air and fresh water overstated it 's not urgent something for virtuous consumers or lifestyle choice well president john f kennedy said something about this that is just but they are far less than the costs of comfortable inaction i can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus the odds that it 's not completely wrong are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we 'll get in a car accident well maybe not if you live in boston laughter but my point is is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially so by investing sustainably we 're doing two things we and at the same time you like it i like it too because that 's where you 're going to spend the rest of your life"
