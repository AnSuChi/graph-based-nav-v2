  "transcript": "so let 's talk about the talk about the state let 's talk about what sort of a web i got permission in the end after about a year to basically do it as a side project i wrote the code i was i suppose the first user there was a lot of concern that people didn 't want to pick it up because it would be too complicated a lot of persuasion a lot of wonderful collaboration with other people and bit by bit it worked and in fact a few years later in two thousand percent of the world population were using the world wide web in two thousand and seven seven years later seventeen percent in two thousand and eight we formed the world wide web foundation partly to look at that and worry worry about and now here we are in two thousand and fourteen and forty percent of the world are using and counting obviously it 's increasing i want you to think about both sides of that okay obviously to anybody here at ted the first question you ask is what can we do to get the other sixty percent on board as quickly as possible lots of important things obviously it 's going to be around mobile but also i want you to think about the forty percent because if you 're sitting there yourself sort of you don 't remember things anymore you just look them up then you may feel that it 's been a success and we can all sit back but in fact khan academy for crying out loud there 's wikipedia there 's a huge number of free that you can read online lots of wonderful things for education things in many areas online commerce has in some cases completely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether made types of commerce available which weren 't available at all before commerce has been almost universally affected but very affected and on a lots of open data lots of e government also lots of things which are less visible the healthcare late at night when they 're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have when they just talk those sorts of things are not they 're not out there and in fact they 've acquired a certain amount of privacy neutral medium without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it 'll be done by people who may abuse so in fact something we realized we can 't just use the web we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing is it in fact of a quality that we need we revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech we can tweet and oh lots and lots of people can see our tweets except when they can 't except when or so we must protest and make sure that censorship is cut down that the web is opened up where there is censorship we love the fact that the web is open it allows us to talk anybody can talk to anybody it doesn 't matter who we are and then we join these big social networking companies which are in fact effectively built as silos so that it 's much easier to talk to somebody in the same social network than it is to talk to somebody in a different one so in fact we 're sometimes limiting ourselves and we also have if you 've read the book about the filter bubble the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like so we love it when we 're bathed in what things we like to click on rose colored spectacles view of the world so here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have what sort of web i want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces as some countries have been suggesting they should do in reaction to recent surveillance i want a web which has got i want a web where i want a web where the other i want i want us to use this about what sort of a web we want you can go to how about we do that how about we decide these becoming fundamental rights the right to communicate with whom what would be on your list for that magna carta let 's crowdsource a magna carta for let 's do that this year let 's use the energy from the 25th anniversary to crowdsource a magna carta to the web"
