  "transcript": "so in the world of product design the beautiful baby 's like the concept car you see it and you go oh my god i 'd buy that in a second so why is it that this year 's new cars look pretty much exactly like last year 's new cars i don 't want to talk about beautiful babies i want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design those sort of dorky teenage years where you 're trying to figure out how the world works i 'm four million babies around the world mostly in developing countries it turns out half of those kids or about one point eight million newborns around the world would make it if you could just keep them warm for the first three days so this is a newborn intensive care unit in kathmandu nepal all of these kids in blankets belong in incubators something like this this is what we want probably what happened is a hospital in japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to to nepal the problem is keeping a baby warm for a week that so we conducted months of user research overseas trying to think like designers human centered design let 's figure out what people want so this is the neonurture infant incubator and this has a lot of smarts built into it and we felt great so the idea here is unlike the concept car we want to marry something beautiful with something that and our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to take this model and run with it here 's the bad news the only baby ever actually put inside the neonurture incubator but it felt like a booby prize we wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place and i don 't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm so it turns out that design for inspiration it 's either too slow or it just doesn 't work it 's ineffective so really rural doctors overloaded nurses we thought we had all our bases covered we 'd done everything right well it turns out there 's this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful manufacturing distribution regulation michael free at path says you have to figure out who will choose use and pay the dues for a product like this and i have to ask the question that well here 's an example this is a bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility it turns out he doesn 't buy any of his equipment those decisions are made by the ministry of health similarly here 's a multinational turns out they 've got to fish where the fish are so it turns out that in emerging markets where the fish are are the emerging middle class of these countries diseases of affluence heart disease infertility turns out that design for outcomes we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project so we started by finding a manufacturer an organization called mtts in vietnam our other partner is east meets west an american foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region we started with them saying well what do you want what 's a problem you want to solve and they said let 's work on newborn jaundice mind boggling global problems jaundice affects two thirds of newborns around the world if it 's not treated the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either even die there and that 's what 's called an exchange transfusion so as you can imagine that 's expensive and a little bit dangerous it 's very technological it 's very complex a little daunting you 've got to shine blue light on the kid bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover how is this a hard problem ok we 'll figure that out and here 's how it 's supposed to be used it 's illuminating a single patient take it out of an american hospital send it overseas to a crowded facility in asia here 's how actually used the effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity these dark blue squares show you where it 's effective phototherapy we see other examples of problems like this here 's a neonatal intensive care unit where moms come in to visit their babies keep in mind that mom maybe just had a c section so that 's already kind of a bummer mom 's visiting her kid she sees her baby naked lying under some blue lights looking kind of vulnerable maybe not the best behavior in fact that sounds what we 've learned is that there 's no such thing as a dumb user it 's the use when we think about our partner mtts they 've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses so here 's an overhead warmer and a cpap really rugged they 've treated fifty thousand kids in vietnam with this technology but here 's the problem every doctor in the world every hospital administrator has seen tv curse those er reruns turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like they want buck rogers they don 't want if we want people to trust a device it has to look trustworthy so thinking about outcomes it turns out appearances matter and here 's what we developed this is the firefly phototherapy device we didn 't stop at the concept car our goal is to make a state of the art product that our partner mtts can actually manufacture our goal is to study how they work the resources they have access to so that they can make this product so and the idea here is it 's obvious how you ought to use this device if you try to put more than one kid in you 're stacking them on top of each other so the idea here is you want to make it hard to use wrong in other words you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it another example silly mom thinks her baby looks cold wants to put a blanket over the baby that 's why we have lights above and below the baby in firefly so if mom does put a blanket over the baby it 's still receiving effective phototherapy from below last story here until you 've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside you think i had a laptop in the peace corps and had all these dead pixels on it and one day i looked in they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished those poor ants so with firefly what we did is the problem is electronics get hot we decided we can 't put a do not enter sign next to the vent we actually got rid of all that stuff so firefly 's totally sealed these are the kinds of lessons as awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager i actually have to pay attention there 's no excuse for failure i have to think like an existentialist i have to accept that there are no dumb users only dumb products to ask ourselves hard questions are we designing for the world that we want are we designing for the world that we have are we designing for the world that 's coming whether we 're ready or not i got into this business thank you"
