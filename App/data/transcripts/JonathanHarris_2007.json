  "transcript": "i really consider myself but i don 't really tell stories in the usual way in the sense that i don instead i 'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories people all around the world but i also think that we have trouble seeing that and we define ourselves by our gaps there 's we have all these gaps and i think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something some smaller community but i think that actually despite and i think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves i think this is a very old human desire it 's nothing new but the thing about self expression is that there 's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen is nothing new since the dawn of human history we 've tried to rectify this imbalance by scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper gossiping with friends this is nothing new what 's new is that in the last several years and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them what 's different in the world today than usual this is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world 's newly posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases i feel or i am feeling gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence then knowing the geographical location and the time we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence all of this information is saved in a database it 's reached about seven and a half million human feelings now and i 'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then the color of each particle corresponds to the any dot can be clicked and expanded and we see here i would just feel so much better if i could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips so it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions and all of these are stated by people i know that objectively it really doesn 't mean much but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond it 's nice to feel bigger again the dots exhibit human qualities they kind of have their own physics and they swarm wildly around kind of exploring the world of life and then they also exhibit curiosity you can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now you can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words those six words represent the six movements of we feel fine we murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling and then one by one in reverse chronological order they excuse themselves entering the scrolling list of feelings i feel a bit better now i feel confused and unsure of what the hell i want to do i feel gypped out of something awesome here i feel so free i feel so good i feel like i 'm in this fog of depression that i can 't get out of and you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected and in that way you can connect with the authors of these statements montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a in a grid this grid is then said to represent the picture of the world 's feelings in the last few hours if you will each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up we see i just feel like i 'm not going to have fun if it 's not the both of us that was from someone in michigan we see i feel like i have been at a computer all day these are automatically constructed mobs provides different statistical we can also get a gender breakdown and we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men we can do an age breakdown which gives us a histogram of the world 's emotional distribution by age we see people in their in their twenties are the most prolific by teenagers and then people in their thirties and it dies out very quickly from there in weather the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent so that finally location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of numerical views on the data we see that the world is feeling used at three point three times the normal level right now they 're feeling warm at two point nine times the normal level and so on other views are also available here are gender age weather location the final movement is called mounds it 's a bit different from the others mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle you can see the little pink cursor moving along representing our position here we see people that feel slipping nauseous responsible there 's also a search capability if you 're interested in finding out about a certain population for instance you could find women who feel in their 20s when it was cloudy in bangladesh but i 'll spare you that so here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected i feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn 't even room for me i feel very lonely i need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that i can feel beautiful i feel invisible to you i wouldn 't hide it if society didn 't make me feel like i needed to i feel in love with carolyn i feel so naughty i feel these weirdoes i love how i feel today it scans the world 's blogs and looks at what people are writing and because of that you end up getting very honest candid sincere responses that are often very moving and this is a technique they 're just living life and they end up just acting like that which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in two thousand and six it was divided into ten very simple themes love sadness and so on each of which contained a single very open ended question put to the world what do you love what makes you angry what makes you sad what do you believe in and so on the time capsule was available for one month online translated into ten languages and the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule the ten themes radiate out and orbit the you can sift through this this data and see what people have submitted this is in response to what 's beautiful miss world there are two modes to the time capsule there 's one world which presents the spinning globe and many voices which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one albuquerque in new mexico at the jemez pueblo where for three consecutive nights the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient red rock canyon walls which stand about two hundred feet tall it was really incredible you can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a forty five degree angle there this was amazing because but you know as i looked at this more and more and more and saw these images go across the rocks i realized i was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again you know births the first camel or horse depending on the culture and it was really moving and this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away you know as a child in vermont on a farm where i grew up i would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of and it caused me to wonder about our world today what would we draw what are the great stories it 's called universe revealing our modern mythology so it 's my great pleasure now to show this to you so universe will open here and you 'll see that it leads with a and there 's an aurora the color of the aurora borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom and these aren 't just little points of light little pixels each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world a quote that was stated by somebody an image a news story a person a company you know some kind of heroic personality and you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars that shapes begin to emerge we see here there 's a little a little man walking along or maybe a woman and we see here a and those are the constellations today this is the universe of two thousand and seven the last two months the data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world it 's using the api of a really great and it 's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of of the world 's current mythology over the last couple of months so we can see where it 's emerging here like president ford and we can actually isolate just the words i call them secrets and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list and we see anna nicole smith president ford this is gerald ford 's funeral we can actually click anything in universe and have it become the center of the universe and everything else will enter its orbit 'll click ford and now that becomes the center and the things that relate to ford enter its orbit and swirl around it we can isolate just the photographs and we now see those we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe now the things that relate to it are swirling around we can click on this and we see this iconic image of betty ford kissing her husband 's coffin in universe there 's kind of no end it just goes infinitely but we can actually and let 's see in the past what he 's been up to so now we have a new universe which is just constrained to all things bill clinton we can have his constellations emerge here we can pull out his secrets and we see that we can see the stories that bill clinton is any of those can be opened up so we see obama and the clintons meet in alabama you can see that this is an important story there are a lot of things in its orbit if we open this up we can also see the superstars these would be the so there 's bill clinton barack obama scooter libby these are kind of the people of bill clinton we can also see a world map so this shows us the geographic reach of bill clinton in the last week or so we can see he 's been focused in america because he 's been campaigning probably but a little bit of action over here in the middle east but he was back to work on sunday and it 's not limited to just people or dates but we can actually put in concepts also so if i put in climate change for all of two thousand and six we and there are also quotes that you can see if you 're interested in reading about quotes on climate change you know this is really an infinite thing so and you 'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be you 'll notice that in daylife rather in universe which is represented by something as broad as say two thousand and seven and also a personal mythology as you search for the things that so it 's been a pleasure thank you very much"
