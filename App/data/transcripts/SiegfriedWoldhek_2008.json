  "transcript": "good morning let 's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all leonardo da vinci we 're all familiar with his fantastic work his drawings his paintings his inventions his writings but we do not know his face thousands of books have been written about him and it remains about his looks well known portrait is not accepted by many art historians so what do you think is this the face of leonardo da vinci or isn 't it let 's find out leonardo was a man that drew everything i find that hard to believe his contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here en face so let 's try to find them i think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self portraits we would find his face looking at us so i looked at all of his drawings more than seven hundred and looked for male portraits there are about one hundred and twenty you see them here which ones of these could be self portraits well for that they have to be done as we just saw en face or so we can eliminate all the profiles and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome even beautiful man so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures and look what happens only three candidates remain that fit and here they are yes indeed the old man is there i 've made more than one thousand one hundred portraits myself for newspapers over the course of three hundred thirty years sorry thirty i couldn 't believe my eyes when i first saw that there is no reason why these portraits should look alike all we did was look for portraits now what was the age of leonardo at the time does that fit yes it does he was potentially of the same person of the same age and here 's the only the only picture of leonardo that 's widely accepted it 's a statue made by verrocchio of david for which leonardo posed as a boy of fifteen and if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician you see the very same features again the statue is the reference and it connects the identity of leonardo to those three faces"
