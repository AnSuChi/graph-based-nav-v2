  "transcript": "billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer all the scouts told him so they told his parents that they predicted that he was going to be a star he didn 't want to sign that contract he wanted to go to college which is what my mother who actually does love me said that i should do too and i did he struggled mightily and he actually ended up in management he ended up as a general manager of the oakland a 's i can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the bigs it 's a failure and what i want to talk to you about today and share with you is that our healthcare system our medical system is just as bad at predicting what happens to people in it patients others and yet every day thousands of people in this country we hear about pre hypertension we hear about obviously linked to heart attacks potentially you may find a website which i did which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat you i have a name for all of these conditions it 's another precondition i call them preposterous pre cancerous lesions and yet if you take for example subclinical a bone thinning disease you would have to treat two hundred and seventy women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone and so is it any wonder given all of the costs and the side effects of the drugs that we 're using to treat these preconditions that every year we 're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet one hundred thousand people a year and that 's a conservative estimate are dying not because of the conditions they have but because of the treatments that we 're giving them and the complications of those treatments we 've medicalized everything in this country strike one is it has to be treated strike two is if you get pregnant strike three is we all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms for decades until all of a sudden we realized because a study came out a big one nih funded it said actually a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good for many i don 't want to leave the men out i after all you all have so just take a moment it 's called pre death but i have some good news for you because i 'm a journalist i like to end things in a happy way or that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk which we 'll see if that happens for everyone you will be a i think i made it up i didn but hasn 't actually had that cancer to call themselves you are a pre vivor we 've had hbo here this morning i 'm wondering if mark burnett is anywhere in the audience i 'd like to suggest a you 're off the island but the problem is we have a system most of them prescribe medications patients come to them they want to do something we 're americans they want a treatment they want to be told this is what you have and this is how you treat it if the doctor doesn 't give you that even worse if you are diagnosed with something eventually and the doctor didn 't order that test we have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand the indications expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment because that obviously helps their bottom line we have advocacy groups like the one that 's come up with pre vivor so that they can raise more funds and raise visibility thank you we have this system and it actually took being a journalist to understand all these incentives you know economists so when you put another mri in every corner you put a robot in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery but you can actually perversely convince them that they have to come it every day that were trying to not necessarily make people worried although that was what often happened and he said to me i 've had honest to goodness high blood pressure for a dozen years now same and it 's a real disease it 's not pre hypertension it 's actual better start taking this statin you need to lower your cholesterol no he said go out and lose some weight come back and see me in a bit or just give me a call and let me know how you 're doing"
