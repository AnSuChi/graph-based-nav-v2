  "transcript": "but actually i 'm a scientist all but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is michigan and like any good but there were three problems three enigmas that i and i want to share with you those problems but most importantly think i figured out a proposal for a solution the first problem i was elected in two thousand and two and at the end of my first year in office in two thousand and three i got a call from one of my staff members who said gov we have a big population eight thousand and they are about to lose their major employer which is a refrigerator factory that 's operated by electrolux and i said well how many people work at electrolux and he said three thousand of the eight thousand people in greenville so i said forget that i 'm the new governor we can fix this we 're going to go to greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make electrolux an offer they can 't refuse pooh bahs of little greenville the mayor the city manager the head of the community college and we basically emptied our pockets and put all of our and as we made our pile of chips we slid them across the table to the management of electrolux and in the pile were things like zero taxes for twenty years or that we 'd help to build a new factory for the so the management of electrolux took our pile our list of incentives and they went outside the room for and they came back in and they said wow this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here so we 're leaving and when they did it was like a nuclear bomb went off in little greenville in fact they did implode the factory that 's a guy that is walking on his last day of work and on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line the employees of electrolux in greenville michigan had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper and and as i went into the into the room there 's thousands of people there it was a just big thing people were eating boxed lunches on roundtop on roundtop tables and there was a sad band playing music or a band playing sad music probably both and he said and i have worked at this factory for thirty years i went from high school to factory my father worked at this factory he said my grandfather worked at this factory who who is ever going to hire me and that was asked not just by that guy and frankly by every worker at one of the fifty thousand factories that closed in the first decade enigma number one how do you create jobs in america in a global economy number two very quickly how do you solve global climate change when we don 't even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in congress seems to be the norm in fact there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared congress 's approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things root canals and donald trump 's at least better than meth labs and gonorrhea so it got me thinking what is it what in the laboratory that i that i see out there the laboratories of democracy what has happened what policy prescriptions have happened that actually cause changes to occur and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way you might say obamacare the thing that caused massive policy changes to occur the government put a $ four point five billion pot and said to the governors across the country compete for it governors competed convincing forty eight state legislatures to essentially raise standards for high schoolers so that they all take a college prep curriculum forty eight states opted because after all if you look at the context and every dollar represents a job and where are those jobs going well they 're going to places that have policy like china in fact when do you think the u s is going to get national energy policy he says take your time because they see our passivity as their opportunity so what if we decided to create a challenge to the governors of the country but actually it 's less than one tenth of one percent of but price to entry into that competition would be you could just say use the president 's goal he wants congress to adopt a clean energy standard of eighty percent why not ask all of the states to do that instead and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer you might take states like iowa and they would say we 're going to lead the nation in producing the wind turbines and the wind energy you might say the solar states the sun belt we 're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country and maybe jerry brown says well i 'm going to create an industry cluster in california to be able to produce the solar panels so that we 're not buying them from china but we 're buying them from the u s in fact every region of the country could do this you see you 've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation in fact if you look just at the upper and northern states in the west they could do geothermal or you could look at texas and say we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid in the middle eastern states which have access to forests we 're going to lead the nation in biofuels in the upper northeast we 're going to lead the nation in in energy efficiency solutions along the eastern seaboard we 're going to lead the nation in offshore wind you might look at michigan and say we 're going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle like the lithium ion battery every region and if you created a competition it respects the states and it respects federalism and it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy now any of you who are watching anything about politics lately might say okay great idea but really congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table they can 't agree to anything so you could wait and go through congress although you should be very impatient or we could go around congress go around congress what if we created a private sector challenge to the governors what if several of the high net worth companies and individuals who are here at ted decided that they would create band together just a couple of them and create a national competition to the governors to have a race to the top what if you were here when we figured out how to crack the code to create good paying jobs in america and get national energy policy you know that our our other nations are in the game and are eating us for lunch and we can get in the game or not we can be at the table and i don 't know about you but i prefer to dine"
