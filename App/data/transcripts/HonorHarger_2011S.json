  "transcript": "we 've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies but the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking and yet despite this hardly any of us have ever heard space how many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star this is what the sun sounds like is the planet jupiter pirouetting through the ice rings of saturn spinning in the distant universe my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises how can we tell the difference between the sound of the sun and the sound of a pulsar answer is the science of radio astronomy and just like the signals that we send and receive here on earth we can convert these transmissions into sound it 's through listening that we 've come to uncover some of the universe 's most important secrets its scale what it 's made of and even how old it is i 'm going to tell you a short story of the history of the universe through listening it 's punctuated by three quick anecdotes which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space but a rather more humble technology and in fact the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution it 's and this is alexander graham bell who was working with thomas watson on the invention of the telephone a key part of their technical set up which was thrown across the rooftops of several houses in boston it also inadvertently became an antenna thomas watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected this is ten years before heinrich hertz proved the existence of radio waves so thomas watson wasn 't listening to us we didn 't have the technology to transmit were these strange noises watson was in fact listening to very low frequency radio emissions caused by nature some of the crackles and pops were lightning but the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin using the very first telephone watson was in fact dialed into the heavens it was a solar wind interacting with our ionosphere that he was listening to so whilst inventing the technology that would usher in the telecommunications revolution watson had discovered that the star at the center of our solar system emitted powerful radio waves he had accidentally been the first person to tune in to them fast forward fifty years and bell and watson 's technology but going from slinging some wire across rooftops in boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the atlantic ocean seabed and so before long bell were looking to new technologies to optimize their revolution radio could carry sound without wires but the medium is lossy it 's subject to a lot of noise and interference so bell employed an engineer to study those noises to try and find out where they came from with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec they turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power now jansky had made a historic discovery fifty years on from watson 's accidental encounter with the sun jansky 's careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration the radio astronomy age over the next few years astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers it 's two scientists have got a problem with noise arno penzias and robert wilson were using the horn antenna at bell 's holmdel laboratory to study the milky way with extraordinary precision they were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity there was a glitch in their soundtrack and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously and so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings but the noise didn 't disappear the mysterious noise that penzias and wilson were listening to turned out to be this was the first experimental evidence that the big bang existed so our story ends at the beginning this is the noise that penzias and wilson heard the oldest sound that you 're ever going to hear the cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the big bang"
