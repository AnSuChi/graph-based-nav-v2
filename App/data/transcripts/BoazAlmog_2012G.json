  "transcript": "the phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum locking and the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature however only recently due to several technological advancements we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor electricity is the flow of electrons and you know that effect however inside a superconductor there are no collisions it 's quite remarkable think about it but that 's not all because superconductors don 't like magnetic fields and it has the means to do that by circulating currents now the combination of both effects the expulsion of magnetic resistance is exactly a superconductor but the picture isn 't always perfect as we all know and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor under proper conditions which we have here these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor and these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor and it turns out that they behave like quantum particles in this movie here you can see how they flow one by one discretely this is strands of magnetic field well first there are strands of magnetic field left inside because their movements dissipate energy which breaks the superconductivity state and by doing that what it actually does is locking itself in place why movement so we get quantum locking and let me show you how this works i have here a superconductor which i it just stays locked in midair now this is not just and it will be locked in this new configuration like this or move it slightly to the right or to the left and it will remain locked now now that we understand that this levitation is actually locking yeah we understand that you won 't be surprised to hear that if i take this circular magnet in which the magnetic field is the same all around why because as long as it rotates the locking is maintained you see i can adjust and i can rotate the superconductor we have frictionless motion it is still so we have quantum locking and but how many fluxons how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this well we can calculate it and it turns out quite a lot one hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this disk but that 's not the amazing part yet because there is something i haven 't told you yet the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here and this extremely thin layer able to levitate it 's a remarkable effect it 's very strong and make whatever track i want i can make a large circular rail here and when i place the superconducting disk on top of this rail it moves freely and again that 's not all i can adjust its position like this and rotate and it freely moves in this new position and let 's try it for the first time i can take this disk and while it stays here don 't move it 's quantum locking not levitation while i 'll let it circulate for a little more let me tell you a little bit about superconductors now laughter so we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors so we can use them to produce such as needed in mri machines particle accelerators and so on but we can also store energy and we could also produce power cables to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations imagine you could back up a single power station with a imagine you would have a disk similar to the one i have here in my hand three inch diameter with a single difference the superconducting layer being two millimeters thin quite thin this superconducting layer could hold one thousand kilograms a small car in my hand"
