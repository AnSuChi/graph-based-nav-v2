  "transcript": "encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new but i bet there 's something you didn 't think about today something so close to home that you probably don 't think about it very often at all and that 's that all the sensations feelings decisions and actions amorphous and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they 've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons now unlike a human designed computer where there 's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans designed them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they 're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered everyday large cells they can a significant fraction of the brain they 're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of downstream partners and this process which takes just a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your one hundred billion cells as you live and think so ideally we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we could see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we could turn them off then both to understand the science and also now before i if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder already a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don 't do it justice though these disorders schizophrenia alzheimer 's depression addiction they not only steal our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated and part of that 's because we 're bathing the brain in the chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell now some people have gotten some solace from and for parkinson 's disease cochlear implants these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we 're sent back to the idea of ultra precise control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go and the first thing i thought about was but not its neighbors and also it would allow us to have the ultra precise control we need if we can install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don 't have the molecule would not and to do that brain doesn 't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that 's gone into the internet and communications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate around two thousand and four in collaboration with gerhard nagel and karl deisseroth there 's a certain alga it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called channelrhodopsins and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that i told you about when blue light hits it so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it 's a protein it 's encoded for in the dna of this organism and put it into neurons so it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be very simple to do and early in the morning one day in the summer of two thousand and four we gave it a try and it worked on the first try you take this dna and you put it into a neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making machinery to fabricate these little and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so this is very powerful and there 's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex network so for example lets sort of consider that basket cell i told you about earlier if we can deliver that gene to these cells and they 're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene of course and then and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so they don 't seem to be averse against that but you can also use this to try to figure out well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells if indeed they 're atrophied now i want to tell you a couple of short stories both at the scientific levels one of the questions we 've confronted so if we could figure out what cells they are we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be so to do that we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the fiorella group so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that 's what happens this animal 's going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that and he 'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons and then we can try to do and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back to the pavlovian days it 's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone so what we do this tone used to mean bad news and there 's a little clock in the and the same tone is going to play and the light is going to flash again okay there it goes right now and now you can see just ten minutes into the experiment that we 've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory if you can delete let 's give an example of where we think this is going to go consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is overactive now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that 's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time until the seizure dies away the brain to be restored to its initial state sort of like a dynamical system that 's being coaxed down into a stable state and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure now i want to close on one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic i already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon seventy five thousand people have parkinson 's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe one hundred thousand people have cochlear implants which allow them to hear there 's another thing which is you 've got to get these genes into cells and new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the probably most of us around this room have and it doesn 't have any symptoms the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and fungi and all over the tree of life most of us don 't have fungi or algae in our brains so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react its early days these have not been done on humans yet but we 're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven 't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light so it 's early days to be upfront but we 're excited about it which we think could potentially many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye relay the information to the the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed now how could you repair this it 's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there 's nothing for the drug to bind to on the so what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other so this is some work that we 're doing it 's being led by one of our collaborators alan horsager at usc and being sought to be commercialized by a start up company eos neuroscience which is funded by the nih and what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it 's a six arm maze and there 's a bit of water in the maze to now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a brute force search he 's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he 's not using vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we 're being careful in trying to look at these different models going to solve this we 're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide we 're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and to this little platform and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives so this pre clinical study i think bodes hope for the kinds of things we 're hoping to do in the future we 're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them thank you some of the stuff is a little dense and being able to target those specifically is a first step the second thing that i think i heard you say is you can now control like an on off switch ed boyden that 's right je which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code eb right yeah so with blue light we can drive information and it 's in the form of a one and by turning things off it 's more or less a zero so our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities je and in theory that means that hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros eb sure and use that to understand more about the brain je does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe we 're now working on so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing je thank you"
