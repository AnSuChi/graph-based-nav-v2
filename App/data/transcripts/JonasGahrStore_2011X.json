  "transcript": "amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today we think of financial and economic primarily the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue our ability to address modern we who are diplomats we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states and i can tell you our agenda is full we loosely call them groups let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since one thousand nine hundred and forty six until today you see the green the ones we used to read about the red is modern conflict conflicts within states these are quite different and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy and the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests so in a way it is everybody 's business recent years is that very few of these domestic interstate intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily plus during the last decade we 've been in the mode where dealing with with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous so we 've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others now i 'm not naive and sometimes military intervention is necessary i happen to believe that libya was necessary and that military intervention in afghanistan was also necessary and my country relies on its security but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict let us turn to afghanistan now again the military is necessary but the military is no when i first came to afghanistan in two thousand and five as a foreign minister i met the commander of we just have to persevere we need military presence but we need to move to politics and it is not us who will solve it afghans have to solve it but then they need a different political process than the one they were given in two thousand and one two thousand and two they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues we didn grasp what was going on and it is doing so because it is neutral and that 's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict because they talk my point is that you don 't have to be neutral to talk prime minister rabin said when he engaged the oslo process you don 't make peace with your let me go one step further this is tahrir square there 's a revolution going on it will last for a long long time and who knows what it will be called in the end that 's not the point the point is that we are probably seeing for the first time in the history of the arab world a revolution so now we find out how little we know right now the discussion goes should we talk to the muslim brotherhood we may legitimize them i think that is wrong and how can we tell as we should because they may turn out to be a majority how can we escape if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don 't want to deal with the groups that are representative how will we ever be interlocutors we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion there 's a big with this so if we refuse to talk to these new groups and if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards there are some rewards on the other side the paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this and the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising and the reason is what happened in south nelson mandela it 's their right to fight now as you know mandela didn 't do that in his memoirs he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being so he engaged a political process of dialogue not as a strategy of the weak and he engaged talking profoundly so what can we learn from all of this dialogue is not easy if we 're going to deal with political of conflicts if we 're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom up supported by technology which is available to all we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations we have to connect with these profound changes i really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side 's signals we need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can and i wouldn 't say that that is the wrong thing in all circumstances sometimes you have to and i believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy not only between states we are seeing some new signs we could never have done the convention against anti personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently by engaging with civil society but they were taking and there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom up this is perhaps a first element of a change i believe we should draw examples from these different to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society and we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times climate change it is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are because of technology and because of globalization societies from bottom up we as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities what is it that makes people trust each other not only between states but also within states what is the legitimacy of diplomacy we have never had as many means the diplomatic toolbox but the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it now i hope in the coming years that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem solving among the afghans inside the palestinian population and as we try to understand this broad movement across the arab world and we need the courage to use them in my country i have seen how the the council of islamist groups but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty tension and when tension increased they already had that dialogue and that was a strength to deal with different issues and for all of these reasons thank you for your attention"
