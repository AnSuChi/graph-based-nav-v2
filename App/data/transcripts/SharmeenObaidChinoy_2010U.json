  "transcript": "i want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens i spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with taliban recruiters trying to understand how the taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children i want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film children of the taliban they target poor families and convince the parents to send their children they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks i made contact with a child from swat who studied in a madrassa like this hazrat ali is from a poor farming family in swat he joined the taliban a year ago he tells me that children are then given months of military training five step process they separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food clothing shelter to these children then they ship them off hundreds step two they rely very heavily on teachers who i have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded step three the taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in so they beat these children i have seen it they tell them that for eight hours at a time all they have to do is read the koran they cannot go home their parents are so poor they have no resources they will be received up up with lakes of honey and milk how there will be seventy two virgins waiting for them in paradise how there will be unlimited this is the brainwashing process that has begun step five i believe the taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda their videos that they use are intercut with photographs of men and women and children dying in iraq and afghanistan and in pakistan and the basic message is that the western powers do not care about civilian deaths so those people who live over six thousand of whom have been killed in the last now these children are primed to become suicide bombers they 're ready to go out and fight because i want you to watch another excerpt from the film he blew himself up killing six this boy is this boy is called messoud he killed twenty eight preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians to eradicate evil for islam if you grew up in these circumstances faced with these choices would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife as one taliban recruiter told me there will always be sacrificial lambs in this war"
