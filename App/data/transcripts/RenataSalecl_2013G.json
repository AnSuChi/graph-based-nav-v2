  "transcript": "when i was preparing for this talk i went to search for a couple of quotes that i can share with you i found three that i particularly liked the first by samuel do not forget to live the second by aeschylus who reminded us that happiness is a choice that requires effort and the third is one by groucho marx who said i wouldn 't want to choose to belong to any club that would have me as a member i didn 't know which one of these quotes to choose and share with you the sweet anxiety of choice in today 's times of but the underside of this ideology has been an increase of anxiety feelings of guilt it appears that this ideology was actually very efficient in pacifying us as political and social thinkers instead of making social critiques we are more and more engaging in sometimes to the point of is still so powerful even among people who have not many things to choose among how come that even people who are poor very much still identify with the idea of choice the kind of rational idea of choice which we embrace now the ideology of choice is very successful in my friend manya when she was a student at university in california was earning money by working for a car dealer now manya when she encountered the would debate with him about his lifestyle how much how many children he has what does he need the car for they would usually come to a good conclusion what would be a perfect car manya 's customer would go home and think things through she would say to him the car that you are buying now is perfect but in a few year 's time your kids will be already out of the house when you will have a little bit more money but what you are buying now is great the majority of manya 's customers who came back the next day bought that other car the car they did not need the car that cost far too much money successful in selling cars that soon she moved on to selling airplanes laughter and why were 's success was that she was able to open in their heads an image of an idealized future an image of themselves when they and for them choosing that other car was as if they are coming closer to this ideal in which it was we rarely make really totally rational choices choices are influenced by our unconscious we 're often choosing also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing we 're also guessing choices are now because of this she said to me i needed one month to decide which dress to wear for weeks i was researching which hotel to stay for this one night i need to choose a sperm donor i looked at this woman in shock sperm donor what 's the rush and i 've been so bad in choosing men in my life because it 's linked to risk is and it was already the famous danish philosopher sren kierkegaard who pointed out that anxiety is linked to the possibility of possibility now we think today that we can prevent these risks we have endless market analysis projections of the future earnings even with market which is about chance my friend bernard harcourt at the university of chicago organized an event a conference on of chance he and i were together on the panel and just before delivering our papers we didn 't know each other 's papers we decided to take chance seriously so we informed our audience a mixture of the two papers which i read my second paragraph in this way towards the end of our papers now you will be surprised that a majority of our audience did not think that what they 'd just listened to was a completely random paper couldn 't believe that speaking from the position of authority like two professors we were we would take big data a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies we decoded our genome we know about our brains more than before but surprisingly people are more and more turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge ignorance and denial are on the rise we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before and no political or changes are needed in regard to ecological crisis we think or others need to act before us or even when ecological crisis already happens like a catastrophe in fukushima often we have people living in the same environment with the same amount of half of them will be anxious psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don 't have passion for knowledge let 's say when we are facing a life threatening illness a lot of people don 't want to know that they 'd rather prefer denying illness which is why it 's not so wise to inform them if they don 't ask surprisingly research shows that sometimes people who deny their illness live longer this ignorance however is not a lot of social damage can be caused now on top of facing ignorance we are also facing today it was french philosopher louis althusser who pointed out that ideology functions in such a way if we go back to this ideology of individual rational choice we often embrace it 's necessary precisely here to lift this obviousness now for me a question often is why we still embrace this why do we think that we are really such masters of our lives that we can rationally make the best ideal choices that we don 't accept losses shocking to see sometimes very poor people for example not supporting the idea of the rich being taxed more quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality okay maybe they don 't think that they will make it and who would want to tax a question for me is also why would people who have no health insurance not embrace universal healthcare but they have nothing to choose from margaret thatcher famously said that there is nothing like a society society doesn 't exist it is only individuals and their families this ideology still functions very well which is why people who are poor might feel ashamed for their poverty we might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices and that 's why we didn 't succeed long hours at the workplace and equally long hours on remaking ourselves we identify with the guru who tells us what to do self help often people ask me me what did you learn by studying choice and there is an important message that i did learn personally first i realized a lot of choice i make is not rational it 's linked to my unconscious my guesses of what others are choosing or what is a socially embraced choice i also we spend so much time choosing things for ourselves and barely reflect on communal choices we can make now we should we can choose to have we can choose to change our environment to have more bees we can choose to have different rating we can choose to control corporations instead of allowing corporations to control us who said that when we make choice in life we shouldn 't forget to live you can see i did have a choice to choose one of the three quotes with which i wanted to start my lecture i did have a choice thank you"
