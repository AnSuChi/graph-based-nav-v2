  "transcript": "like to start my performance by saying ninety percent of everything is crap it 's called sturgeon 's law and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad freely name any card in the deck audience member ten of ninety percent of everything is crap so there 's this to prove that sturgeon was correct jesus crazy people well the truth is i 'll give you a clear little example something that people used to do around the turn of the century not this century the other one the idea was to take a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand in my case the left hand something that would look like but if we give it a little bit more thought like a paper clip a paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting not only that if instead of using my hand with the fingers use my hand closed into a fist that makes this even a little bit more interesting not only that but i will impose myself a time limit of one second something that would look like this now no no no sturgeon may but he doesn 't have to be correct forever things can always change sir what was the card the ten of hearts there 's this to prove that things can always change the ten of hearts secrets are important and this is the best secret i 've it starts with a deck of cards onto the table an old man and a claim i will not touch the deck till the end it doesn 't matter who the man was all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head i will not touch the deck till the end now during all this time was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something but i was not really paying attention to the book because i was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before i will not throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random the old man turned to me and he said you could pick a red card or a black card my answer was could be a high spade or a low spade and my answer was audience member two a high spade hg and my answer was and you selected sorry audience member two king hg king of spades did you feel i influenced you in any decision audience member two no i just felt your energy hg the old man turned to me and he asked me one more the old man only said one more thing this is the end everything that you 're about to see is exactly he counted something i would realize but he left his notebook that was there from the beginning and when i picked it up that was the best secret i 've ever experienced we are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share and this was his way of sharing a secret with me all the time i really do and the reason why we don 't see them as often it 's because we don 't place ourselves in a position but what if what if we decided to search for those amazing things for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing so you have the giraffe i 'm going to ask you do you have with you a united states $ one bill audience member three you see a coincidence i have a dollar bill here to explain i want you to take the dollar bill and fold the washington part now i want you to take the bill and fold it like this lengthwise so it becomes please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it i want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper i 'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and i don 't want you to think oh while i was distracted by helder someone came onstage and swapped the bill so i want to make sure it 's exactly the same bill now not only that i want you to take the paper clip and put it around so even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill i don 't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what i don 't want to see is that fair i want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning of this experience perfect now we 're going to use also the deck and a glass for this and we 're going to put ourselves in a position do you mind can you take some cards and shuffle you can shuffle cards in a variety of ways you can shuffle cards like this you can shuffle cards in a more messed up way something like this you can shuffle cards in the american way as a portuguese i don 't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it but the important part is after shuffling the cards always remember to cut and you too cut and complete and up in the air up in the air and just like that i 'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone i 'm going to try i have some cards that maybe maybe they don 't mean anything but maybe that 's because we are not paying close attention because maybe maybe they mean a lot before we start sir you gave me a dollar bill is that your signature that i 'm going to open your bill and reveal can you take the dollar bill in the serial number there is a letter what is the first number after the letter q like in queen 's my show thank you very much and have a nice night"
