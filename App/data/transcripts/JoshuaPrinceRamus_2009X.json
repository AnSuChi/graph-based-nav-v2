  "transcript": "i 'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency what i mean by that is that it 's time for architecture to do things again not just represent things this is a construction helmet that i received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project i and my firm have ever been involved i thought it represented the importance of the architect i stayed thrilled until i got home threw the helmet onto my bed fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription i think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today we are for decorative purposes only now who do we have to blame we can only blame ourselves over the last fifty years and we architects are cowards so as we have faced liability we have stepped back and back and unfortunately where there is liability guess what there is power so eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position way over here and so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture and we announced hey architecture it 's over here in this autonomous language we 're going to seed control of processes and we were going to do as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create but we would merely write it off as and nine months of child labor is merely execution and we need to start authoring processes again social engineering back into architecture now there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do like understanding procurement processes understanding the time value of money and cost estimation but i 'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process the first is take core positions with your client i know it 's shocking right that architecture would actually and then only after this is done are you allowed to do this begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions and both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you 've taken believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this i 'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control you do not know what the end result is but i promise you with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment you will arrive at conclusions and will simply be something that you could not have initially or individually conceived of alright and we don 't understand why they won 't let us in about instead of doing that we roll up to the gates something they want now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor because of course we all know that inside of the trojan horse were a bunch of people with spears so we can change the metaphor let 's call the trojan horse the vessel by which you get through the gate get through the constraints of a project at which point you and your client have the ability to start considering what you 're going to put the vision and if i could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this if we are so good at our craft shouldn 't we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project 's and the client 's constraints and that 's a project that is just about to open next week the new home for the dallas theater center the dee and charles wyly theatre now i 'm going to present it on the same terms issue position and architectural manifestation now the first issue that we faced was that the dallas theater center had a notoriety that chicago and seattle but it also had to do with something rather unusual and that was this horrible little building that they 'd been performing in why was this horrible horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building you cannot tear the proscenium down when an artistic director wanted to do a cherry orchard and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage they brought a backhoe in and they simply dug the hole and you can start to get the best artistic directors scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can 't do elsewhere we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn 't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company and that 's that the company and the building was multiform that meant that they were able to perform as long as they had labor in fact something happened to all institutions around the world it started to become hard to raise operational costs operational budgets so they stopped having inexpensive labor and eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided the ability to move between stage configurations had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb it was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house at first blush you think hey it 's crazy what could you possibly gain we created what we like to call superfly and because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional and you can drill cut nail screw paint and replace and that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief but also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief he or she can do so in fact it really was the clients who had to do it they had to make a decision based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital a architecture and one third infrastructure to actually the inverse two thirds infrastructure and one third capital a architecture that 's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept but based on the positions they took the educated leap of faith to do so and effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine now that theater machine has ability to move meaning the artistic director doesn 't necessarily need to go through our lobby one of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects because they say the first thing they have to do the first five minutes of well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture so in fact there is the building there is what we call the draw you 're going down into our lobby go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits whether you like them or not up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium now imagine what that could be i have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long but imagine the freedoms if you could take this further that in fact you could consider a wagnerian entry a first act in thrust an intermission in greek a second act in arena and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits now that i would say is architecture performing it is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director you notice that there is no proscenium the balconies have been raised up there are no seats the floor in the auditorium is flat the first configuration is easy to understand the balconies come down you see that the orchestra begins to have a rake that 's frontal towards the end stage and the seats come in the third configuration is a little harder to understand here you see and some of the seats need to actually change their direction and change their rake to allow that to happen i 'll do it again so you can see it and there it is in the thrust configuration in order to do that again we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks and they told us one important thing you shall not beta test but they were willing for us to apply technologies from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building and the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift now if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey and so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations the second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house changing the rake you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur as i said all that was here you see the building in its current state with blinds closed this is a trompe l 'oeil actually this is not a curtain these are vinyl blinds that are integrated into the windows themselves again with failsafe mechanisms that can be lifted the operations of the theater going on behind rehearsals and so forth but you also have the ability you would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber aida their elephants you can bring the elephants in you would be able to expose the auditorium to dallas or vice versa dallas to the auditorium you 'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession allow people to come in and out for an intermission or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance as i said all the balconies can move but they can also be but most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure please consider doing your christmas party here laughter that allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums that 's an enormous benefit so the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic but can also do beckett with the skyline of dallas sitting behind it the theater has been going through its kind of paces here it is in an end stage configuration it 's actually beautiful there was a rock band we stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked and you could see the guys and last but not least you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem i 'm going to show you a brief so in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around and think of it being done with just a few people just a couple people are required and last but not least you can see the winspear opera house on the right and the dee and charles wyly theater on the left"
