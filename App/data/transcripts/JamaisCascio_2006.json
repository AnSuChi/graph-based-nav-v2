  "transcript": "the future that we will create it 's quite literally my job i 'm co founder and senior columnist at alex steffen and i founded worldchanging in late two thousand and three and since then we and our growing global team of contributors ever expanding variety of solutions that are out there right now and on the near horizon in a little over two years we 've written up about four thousand items emerging ideas all providing a path to a future that 's more sustainable more equitable and more desirable our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional online and off if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell bound handbasket is moving we want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it we focus primarily on the planet 's environment international conflict responsible use of emerging technologies even the rise of the so called second superpower and much much more the scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so a quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface but to give you a sense of what we cover tools for rapid disaster relief such as this inflatable concrete shelter wind vehicles you can get right now and better urban design so you don 't need to drive as much in the first place distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate also a number of the topics that we 've been talking about this week at ted are things that we 've addressed in the past on worldchanging as a but working at worldchanging has convinced me much to my own surprise that successful responses to the world 's problems are nonetheless possible moreover i 've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success as norwegian social scientist evelin lindner has observed pessimism is a luxury of good times we have the knowledge and our understanding of the planet improves every day we have a world that needs fixing and nobody 's going to do it for us many of the solutions that i and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common transparency collaboration a willingness to experiment and an appreciation of science or more appropriately science the majority of models tools and ideas on worldchanging encompass combinations of these we can see world changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible that is we know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand many of us have experienced the change in driving that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one 's driving habits affect the vehicle 's efficiency the last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big or too intangible or too slippery to grasp easily simple technologies like and what kind of results you 'll get if you turn off a few lights community tools like text messaging that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion data rich displays like maps of campaign contributions or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all we can see world changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world 's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action but i 'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge enabled solutions are far more important for example open access journals like the public library of science make cutting edge scientific research free to all everyone in the world and actually a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for leishmaniasis and chagas disease but my favorite example has to be the global response to the sars epidemic in two thousand and three two thousand and four which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the sars virus the u s national research council in its follow up report on the outbreak and we can see world changing values in something as humble as a cell phone i can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this and we 're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about you may already know some of the big picture aspects globally more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera and over the network and sometimes enter history books developing world mobile phones have become economic drivers a study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent gdp increases across africa from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press and even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate it 's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world 's most important technologies and in this rapidly evolving context it 's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction i 've long admired the witness project and peter gabriel and i 'm just incredibly happy to see the news that witness is going to be opening up a web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the internet than just hand carrying the videotape not only does this add a new and potentially safer imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists imagine a web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what 's happening to the planet putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world a better world come about it would be in essence an just to be clear in this talk i 'm using the name earth witness as part of the scenario simply as a shorthand for what this imaginary project could aspire to not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the witness organization it could just as easily be called environmental transparency project smart mobs for natural security but earth witness is a lot easier to say now many of the people who participate in earth witness would focus on ecological but the earth witness project wouldn 't need to be limited to problems in the best worldchanging tradition it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility earth witness would show us two worlds the world we 're leaving behind and the world we 're building for generations to come the key components are already widely available camera phones of course would be fundamental to the project and for a lot of us they 're as close as we have yet to but very few of us forget our phones you could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones over the course of last year open source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for and the earth phone could spin off from from this kind of project at the other end of the network there 'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to accessible over the web combining a photo sharing service social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system i mean simply this the online part of the earth witness project would be created by the users working together and working openly that 's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what 's now happening to our planet but we could do more an earth witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone now but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots at u c irvine using bird mounted sensors as a way of of measuring it 's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person now the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new swedish firm uppsala biomedical uploading the data displaying the results even the lawrence livermore national labs have inexpensive sensors on the market and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature co2 or methane levels the presence of some biotoxins potentially in a see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with larry brilliant 's instedd project now all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis and that 's worth noting in particular the impact of open access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu earth witness would take this further linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world it 's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished we 'd have a far better far better knowledge of what 's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of it would be a collaborative bottom up approach to environmental awareness and protection able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way and if you need greater sensor density just have more people show up and most important you can 't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth this is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data and as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption every little bit of information matters a system like earth witness would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and ultimately the improvement of the planet itself nobody 's going to do it for us"
