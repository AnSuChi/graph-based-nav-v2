  "transcript": "i 'd like to talk today meet joe joe 's thirty two years old i met joe thirteen years ago on the lifer wing at wormwood scrubs high security prison in london i 'd like you to imagine this place it looks and feels like it sounds wormwood scrubs it is where england 's most dangerous prisoners are kept these individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil and i was there u k department of health my task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths that meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population what lay at the root of their behavior was there a neurological cause for their condition so i 'd like to speak about i was always intrigued by how people change my mother a clinical psychotherapist would she would shut the door to the living room and i imagined at the age of five or six i would creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door on more than one occasion i fell asleep and they had to and i suppose that 's how i found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression said any trouble just press the red buzzer and we 'll be around as soon as we can i looked up at the red buzzer far behind joe on the opposite wall perhaps detecting my concern he leaned forward and said as reassuringly as he could looking specifically at their ability to to categorize different images of emotion and we looked at their physical response to those emotions so for example when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad we instantly have increased heart rate sweating of the skin so we wanted to look closer at this to use mri to image their brains that turned out to be not such an easy task imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central london in shackles and handcuffs and in order to place each after some time however we had a tentative answer these individuals there was something else people like joe it is thought to be key to the experience the larger and more active their amygdala is so like learning virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects at the age of at first this isn 't looking through a picture book licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand bit by bit we build the foundations of the social brain so that by the time we 're another prerequisite for empathy fact that this developmental progression strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn try as i 've done to renege on a promise you 've made you will find that the mind of a four year old is not nave in the slightest it is more akin to a swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult say it 's impossible a recent wonderful study from stanford university showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero for their benefit for over one hundred years neuroanatomists and no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain the brain could only change within certain set limits that was the dogma but then in the the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian first in the olfactory bulb which is responsible for our sense of smell then in the hippocampus and finally in the amygdala itself i left the psychopaths and joined a lab in oxford specializing in learning and development instead of psychopaths so if you rear a mouse in a standard cage a repetitive behaviors this naturally sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice even becoming aggressive when introduced to them demonstrate neurogenesis the birth of new brain cells and as we showed they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks now they don 't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street mice reared in a standard cage by contrast not dissimilar you might say from a prison cell have dramatically lower levels of new it is now clear that the amygdala of mammals including primates like us can show in some areas of the brain more than twenty percent of cells are newly formed we 're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change however our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment stress the more stress the less brain development which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels this is the interplay between nature and nurture when you is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth of course imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society the evidence is actually the other way because we need to take responsibility for our actions and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation one way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs and perpetrators meet face to face and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and the victim perhaps for the first time the victim as a as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response this stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective but for many it could be a way to break the frozen sea within so what can we do now how can we apply this knowledge i 'd like to leave you with the first thing that i learned was that we need to change since wormwood scrubs was built one hundred and thirty years ago society has advanced in virtually every aspect in the way we run our schools our hospitals if not medieval times i believe we 've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human nature cannot change and as a society it 's costing us dearly we know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change the second thing i have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral it 's easy enough for a neuroscientist to that turns out not to be so easy but ultimately what we want to show is is whether we 're able to reduce the reoffending rates in order to answer complex questions like that we need people of different backgrounds philanthropists and human rights activists to work together finally i believe we need to change our own amygdalae because this issue goes to the heart not just of who joe is but who we are we need to change our view of joe as someone because if we see joe as wholly irredeemable how is he going to see himself as any different will he be among the seventy percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system wouldn 't it be better if while serving his sentence joe was able to train his amygdala which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released surely that would be in the interest of all of us"
