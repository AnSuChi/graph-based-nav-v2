  "transcript": "today i 'm going to share my personal journey with female genital mutilation cross your i was born in sierra leone did anybody watch blood diamond if you have any thoughts by the way be seated you 're fine i that 's what i say oh yeah he was when i was three war broke out in sierra leone in i remember literally going to bed one night stay away from it while we were there as refugees what was going to become of us she 's a wonderful smart woman that one and we were lucky australia said we will take you in good job aussies before we were meant to travel my mom came home one day and said we 're going on a little holiday a little trip she put us in a car and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in gambia in this bush we found two huts an old lady came towards us she was and went back then she came back and walked and then she pinned me down on the floor i struggled and tried to get her off me but i couldn 't then the old lady came towards me with a rusty looking knife one of the sharp knives orange looking has never seen water or sunlight before but she didn 't she slowly slid down my body and ended up where my vagina is she took hold of what i now know to be my clitoris and started cutting away inch and asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop but all she did was say quiet this old lady sawed away at my flesh for what felt like forever and then when she was done she threw that piece of flesh across the floor as if it was the most disgusting thing she 's ever touched they both got off me and left me there bleeding crying and confused as to what just we never talked about this again very soon we found that we were coming to australia and people said we were going to the end of the world there was nowhere else to go after australia yeah that comforted us a bit it then france and we spent fifteen minutes opening the tap like this then somebody came in slid their hand under and water came out and we thought is this what we 're in for like seriously we got to adelaide small place where literally they dumped us in adelaide that 's what i would say they dumped us there we were very grateful we settled and we liked it we were like we 're home we 're here you must take us back to australia had to be explained to her that so fine it 's all good my mom then had this brilliant idea that i should go to a girls school because they were less racist i don 't know where she read that publication and i was the only black child there were no asians no indigenous all we had was some tan girls girls who felt the need to be under the sun it wasn 't the same as my chocolate though not the same settling in australia was quite hard but it became harder when i started volunteering for an organization called women 's health statewide africa the middle east asia and now australia and london and america because as we all know we live in a multicultural society and people who come from those backgrounds i was looking at the chart of the different types of female genital mutilation fgm i will just say fgm for short type i is when they cut off the hood and type iii is when they cut off the whole clitoris and then they sew you up so you only have a little hole to pee and have your period my eyes went onto type ii i was in so much shock and traumatized by what had happened i didn 't remember any of it but i had no recollection of what had happened but i thought everybody had a scar down there this had happened to everybody else but when i looked at type ii i remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down words cannot express the pain i felt the confusion that i felt because now i realized that what was done to me was a terrible my mother had said it was called circumcision but here it was but you cut away something that belonged to me she said yes i did it was in your best interest then they sleep around with everybody you are not going to sleep around with anybody empowerment was very strange i went back to school the naughty bits pleasure and relationships and of course sex though and i thought i watched tv and those women would moan like oh oh i was like these people and their damned clitoris that 's what i want to know i want to do that too oh oh and all of that didn 't happen so i came home once again and said to my mom dolly and girlfriend said that i should be having was dolly that said that and i thought to myself i had an inner joke in my head that said i will marry a white man he won 't have that problem with me so i said to my mom dolly and girlfriend said i deserve pleasure and do you know what you have taken away from me what you have denied me i want to get horny dammit it was celebrated i was an african australian so once i went through this strange phase of anger and pain and confusion and i said to her and then to her i feel like i 'm not a woman am i going to be asexual it 's so that we don 't have any sexual desire asexual now will i just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex not enjoying sex she couldn 't answer my questions so they went unanswered when i started having my period around the age of fourteen i realized i didn 't have normal periods because of fgm my periods were heavy they were long and they were very then they told me i had fibroids they 're like these little balls sitting there one was covering one of my ovaries and there came then the big news i was an angry black i went home and i said to my mom your action no matter what your may defense may be because she thought she did it out love what do you have to say for that then i got married you figure that out very soon it hurt all the time and of course i i am the lucky girl all that pain into advocacy because i needed my pain to be worth something you heard me right why no fgm australia fgm is in australia two days ago i had to call child protective services because somewhere in australia couple of months ago i met a lady who is married to a malaysian man her husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters back to malaysia to cut off their clitoris and she said why he said they were dirty and she said well you married me he said oh this is my cultural belief they then went into a whole discussion where she said to him over my dead body will you do that to my daughters but imagine if this woman wasn 't aware of what fgm was if they never had that conversation her children would have been flown over to malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives do you know the millions of dollars it would take us to deal with an issue like that [ three in australia are at risk of having fgm performed on them it 's everybody 's problem well i say no to that what i have to say to that i am proud to say that i 'm doing my part in ending fgm there may be a patient who comes to your hospital who is at risk of fgm but this is the reality that even in our beloved australia the most wonderful place in the world children are being abused because of a culture i want ever single one of you to see fgm as an issue for you make it personal it could be your daughter your sister your cousin change org and type in khadija my name and it 'll come up and sign it because every child every child has a right to their bodies being left intact and dammit ever child has a right to a clitoris so please join me my favorite quote is all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men and you going to let this evil of female genital i don 't think so so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation thank you"
