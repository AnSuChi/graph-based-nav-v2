  "transcript": "it is a story of hope resilience and glamour there was hollywood almost two thousand films were made in nigeria now try to imagine fifty films wrapped distributed every week in the streets of lagos nigeria and west africa some estimates put it has created but keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement this is something that happened without foreign investment and actually it happened against all odds in one of the most difficult moments in nigerian economy the industry is fifteen years old you 're thinking now why how an italian filmmaker based in boston and so i think i have to tell you just a few words a few things about my personal because i think there is a connection my grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in zambia my father i really felt that africa was this big part of my life and it really was a place a place where i learned to so and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories it seemed that for our neighbors and friends africa was either this exotic place this and i remember really this desire to talk about africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives and have dreams like we all have so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions here i can tell a story of africans making movies like i do and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me and we really look independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost so when i proposed the story i really had all the support to make this film i found two wonderful partners in crime and robert caputo a friend and a mentor who franco in twenty five years of covering africa i don 't know if i have come across a story that is so full of hope the plan was to give you a portrait of nollywood of this incredible film industry following bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of and he had nine days to make it we thought this was a good we had to cover nollywood and we talked to a lot of but i don 't want to create too many expectations i would like to show you six minutes so i guess it 's a world premier for those who work in it is a kind of subsistence filmmaking what they do to make a living you jump onto the because if you don 't make the next film you 're not going to feed we should be able to educate i believe in the power of i think it 's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable so if you 're making a movie no matter what your topic is put in a message in keep trying to explain to people it 's not about the quality at the moment the quality is coming i mean there are those films that people are making for quality but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that africa still has people that live on one dollar a day and these are the people that really watch that has just been born in this part of the world because nobody believed that nollywood can come out of africa our people for our people we have been so deep into the foreign movies it 's all about the foreign movies but we can do something you see the person live you see how he talks you see how he lives it is not what you with those cowboy movies but then when i discovered the situation in my country at that time there was so much corruption for a young man to really make it out here you got to think of some negative things and all that or some kind of vices and i didn 't want that you know and i discovered that i could be successful in life as an actor without doing crime without cheating nobody without telling no lies just me and they have all these things in place but here we but she 's a professional she knows what shes doing i 'm trying to protect my face too this ain 't going to be my last movie you know this is nollywood where the magic lives with or without any assistance from anybody i just can 't tell you and the problems they have but always with a smile always with an enthusiasm that is incredible werner herzog the german filmmaker said i need to make movies like you need oxygen and i think theyre breathing the nigerian filmmakers really really are doing what they like i really i can breathe better there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience its technology im very interested in it and i really think that the digital non linear editing has slashed the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be incredible cameras cost under five thousand dollars and this has unleashed tremendous energy and guess what we didnt have to tell to the nigerian filmmakers they understood it they embraced the technology and they run with it and theyre successful i hope that i hope it will inspire other african nations to embrace the technology look at the nigerian but i really think this is a a phenomenon that can inspire us i really think it goes both ways filmmakers friends of mine they look at nollywood and they say wow they are doing what we really want to do and make a buck and live with this and there 's one thing one small challenge that i have for you and and i think this is really the theme of this session try to imagine a world where the only nothing no novels difficult eh so this is what i really think i think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers and i think that the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this i would like you to hear their voices just a few moments its not an added sequence just some voices from thats nollywood i believe very soon were not only going to have better movies and the nollywood filmmakers really have now to work and i really hope that there will be many many collaborations where we teach each other things and i really hope i think i mentioned briefly it 's close to two thousand films there is scientific data on two thousand and five or six the censor board has censored one thousand six hundred films alone and we know that there are more so its safe to say that there are two thousand films so imagine forty five films per week they need to go to the next level but im optimistic ca and these arent films that are primarily seen in cinemas for you to try to imagine this this these are films that are distributed they are bought in video shops they can be rented for pennies ca it 's vcds it 's a cd it 's a little bit can be in a lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water"
