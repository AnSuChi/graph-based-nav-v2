  "transcript": "footage too graphic to be shown his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second within two minutes three people pass two year old wang yue by others look at her before moving there were other people who walked past wang yue and a second van ran over her legs before a street cleaner raised the alarm she died i wonder how many of you looking at that said to yourselves just now i would not have done that i would have stopped to help raise your hands if that thought occurred to you six point nine million children under five died from preventable that is good six point nine million does it really matter that we 're not walking past them in the street does it really matter that none of that seems morally relevant to me what is really important is can we reduce that death toll can we save some of those nineteen thousand children dying every day and the answer is yes we can each of us you can think what your own habit is whether it 's a new car a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink you could take the money you 're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization the against malaria foundation which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one and we know reliably that if we provide nets they 're used and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria just one of the many preventable diseases that are responsible for some of those nineteen thousand children dying and the result is a growing movement effective altruism it 's important because it combines both the heart and the head but it 's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well directed and not only that but also i think reason helps us to understand that other so i think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want it does help us to put perspective on our and i think that 's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math and that might seem surprising because a lot of people think philosophy is remote from the real world economics we 're told just makes us more and we know that math is for nerds but in fact it does make a difference and in fact there 's one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective altruist because he got this this is the website of the bill & melinda gates foundation and if you look at the words on the top right hand side it says all lives have equal that 's the understanding the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people bill and melinda gates and warren buffett no one not andrew carnegie not john d rockefeller has ever given as much to charity and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective according to one estimate the gates foundation has already saved five point eight million lives and many millions more people getting diseases that would made them very sick even if eventually they survived undoubtably the gates foundation is going to give a lot more is going to save a lot more lives well so i 'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving this is toby ord he 's a research fellow in philosophy at the university of oxford he could give enough to cure eighty thousand people people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate so toby founded an organization called giving what we can to spread this information to unite people who want to share some of their toby himself does better than that he 's pledged to live on eighteen thousand pounds a year that 's less than thirty thousand dollars toby is married and he does have a mortgage and then as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement they returned to and to give both money and time to helping to fight global poverty should i abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these nineteen thousand lives that are lost every day one person who 's thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is will crouch he 's a graduate student in philosophy and he 's set up a website called eighty thousand hours the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career to advise people on how to have the best most effective career but you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider if they have the right abilities and character is to go into banking or finance why because if you earn a lot of money you can give away a lot of money and if you 're successful in that career you could give enough to an aid organization let 's say five aid workers so you can quintuple his name is matt he was a student but he 's gone into finance in new york he 's already earning enough so that he 's giving a six figure sum to effective charities and still leaving himself with enough to live on matt has also helped me to set up an organization that i 'm working with that has the name taken from the title of a book i wrote the life you can save which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we 're going to live an ethical life it 's not enough just to follow the but that if we have enough we have to share some of that with people who have so little and the organization draws together people of different generations like holly morgan who 's an undergraduate who 's pledged to give ten percent of the little amount that she has but has now gone to yale to do an mba to have more to give toby ord is very concerned about this and so it 's very important to find the effective ones providing a guide dog for a blind person that 's a good thing to do right and you get something like that you could provide one guide dog for one blind american or you could cure between four hundred and two thousand people of blindness but if you want to look for effective charities this is a good website to go to givewell exists to really assess the impact of charities not just whether they and it 's screened hundreds of charities so it 's very tough if you want to look for other recommendations but you can find effective and not just in the area of saving lives from so if you want to look for effective organizations to reduce that suffering you can go to effective animal activism possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of so some people think that would be a good thing to give to there 's many possibilities and holly morgan told me that she and now is one of the happiest people she knows the effort becomes too much the boulder escapes rolls all the way down the hill he has to trudge back down to push it up again and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity but then becoming an effective altruist i 'm going to conclude by telling you about an email that i received while i was writing this this talk just a month or so ago it 's who i 'd never heard of this is a picture of him the email began that started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys there 's about one hundred people each year in the u s and more in other countries who do that i was pleased to read it chris went on to say that he 'd been influenced by my writings in what he did well i have to admit i 'm also somewhat embarrassed by that because i still have two kidneys because he calculated that the number of life years that he had added to people the extension of life was about the same that you could achieve if you gave five thousand dollars to the against malaria foundation and that did make me feel a little bit better because i have given more than five thousand dollars to the against malaria foundation there 's a way for you to get off the hook"
