  "transcript": "one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost you think about the arguments we have most of the time it 's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of congress i have a suggestion look at all the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on wall street lying just beneath the surface of those arguments with passions raging on all sides are big questions of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what i would like to do today let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality give you a very short lecture on aristotle of ancient athens aristotle 's theory of justice and then have a discussion here to see whether aristotle 's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today so are you ready for the lecture according to aristotle justice means giving people what they deserve that 's it that 's the lecture now you may say well that 's obvious enough the real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why let 's see what people what what would you say who should get the best flute you can just call it out michael sandel or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them that was aristotle 's answer too why do you think those of you who voted this way that the best flutes should go to the best flute players peter the greatest benefit to all ms the greatest benefit to all we 'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to but peter aristotle doesn 't agree with you that that 's the reason that 's what flutes are for he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose of the thing or the social activity in this case musical performance and the point the essential nature of musical performance is to produce excellent music it 'll be a happy byproduct that but what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing one of the reasons but to honor and recognize flutes may seem the distribution of flutes may seem a let 's take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice it had to do with golf casey martin a few years ago casey martin but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory he asked the pga the professional golfers ' association for permission to use a golf cart and his case went all the way to the supreme court believe it or not the case over the golf cart provided the accommodation does not but i need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next suppose you were on the supreme court suppose you were deciding the justice of this case how many here would say that casey martin does have a right to use a golf cart and how many say no how many would rule in favor of casey martin all right we have a good division of opinion here someone who would not raise your hand and we 'll try to get you a microphone what would be your reason what about how would you answer the objection yes why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart that 's part of part of the game of golf are you a golfer warren i am not a golfer in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue and what do you suppose they all said yes and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game notice something interesting well i should tell you about the supreme court first the supreme court what do you suppose they said they said yes seven to two they ruled what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we 've just had the justice of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential and the supreme court justices wrestled with that question and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was justice scalia he wouldn 't have granted the cart it 's interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise underlying the majority 's opinion he said it 's not possible to determine the essential nature nature of a game like golf here 's how he put it to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement that is what distinguishes games from productive activity it is quite impossible to say that any of a game 's arbitrary rules is essential so there you have justice scalia taking on the aristotelian premise of the majority 's opinion justice scalia 's opinion is questionable for two reasons first no real sports fan would talk that way rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn 't care about the outcome of the objectionable on a second ground on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart let everyone but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been i suspect more anathema to the golfing greats and to the because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart but relatedly the question what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic let me put the point as delicately as possible are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game and the ball stands still so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes that illustrates that it 's hard to decide the question of what justice requires without grappling with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question and what qualities what excellences connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition let 's take a final example that 's prominent in contemporary political debate are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman and there are those who favor state recognition and how many favor the second the opponents of same sex marriage say and the defenders of what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that 's really what marriage is about aristotle has a point very hard to about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition so let 's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter thank you very much open education your lecture series was one of the first to do it big what 's your vision for the next phase of this i think that it is possible in the classroom we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions and i think we can do that in public life more generally and so my real dream would be to take the the public television series that we 've created of the course it 's available now online free for everyone anywhere in the world and to see whether we can partner with institutions universities in china in india in africa around the world to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate ca so you picture at we did a little bit of it here with and we do it in a classroom at harvard with about one thousand students wouldn 't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing engaging seriously with big moral questions exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup students in beijing and mumbai and in cambridge massachusetts and create a global classroom that 's what i would love to do"
