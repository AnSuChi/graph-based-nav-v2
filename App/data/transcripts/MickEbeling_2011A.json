  "transcript": "i have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects but the coolest i ever worked on was around this guy this guy 's name is tempt tempt was one of the foremost graffiti and he came up home from a run one day and said dad my legs are tingling and that was the onset of als so tempt is now completely paralyzed he only has use of his eyes i was exposed to him i have a company that does design and animation so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of of what we admire and respect in the art world and his cause so i went and met with his brother and father and said i just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me and i said wait a second isn 't that i 've seen stephen hawking don 't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices and he said no unless you 're in the upper echelon and everyone seen the movie the diving bell and the butterfly that 's how they communicate so run their finger along i said that 's archaic how can that be so i showed up with the desire to just write a check and instead i wrote a check that i had no freaking idea how i was going to cash tony 's going to speak we 're going to get him a machine and we 're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again because it 's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn 't able to communicate it so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that i met these guys called grl graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on it and it just registers the negative space so they go around and art installations like this all the things that go up there they said there 's a life cycle first it starts with the sexual organs then it starts with cuss words then it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art but there was always a life cycle to their presentations so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and and was telling her about if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things why don 't we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again well that would be awesome and about and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate a stephen hawking machine applause which was awesome and he 's seriously one of the funniest i call him yoda because you talk to the guy you get an email from him and you 're like i 'm not worthy this guy 's so amazing the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world literally every corner of the world my wife and kids and i moved to our and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to but my dog got involved and we created this this is called the eyewriter and you can see the description this is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the venice beach boardwalk and now we 've created a device that has absolutely no limitations there 's no insurance company that can say no there 's no hospital that can say no anybody who 's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their so we went back to tempt 's room and after over a year of planning two weeks of programming and he 's looking over his life support system we kicked his bed so that he and he drew again for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can only imagine what the in the parking lot was the funny thing was we had to break into the parking lot too so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too so at the end of this he sent us an email and this is what the email said and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i could breathe our battle cry that 's what keeps us going and keeps us developing and we 've got such a long way to go with this this we 've had all kinds of acknowledgment we 've won a bunch of awards remember it 's free none of us are making any money on this thing it 's all coming out of our own pockets so the awards were like oh this is fantastic armstrong twittered about us and then in december time magazine honored us as one of the top fifty inventions of two thousand and ten which was really cool the coolest thing about this and this is what 's completing the whole circle is that in april of this year at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles there 's going to be an exhibition called art of the streets and art of the streets is going to have pretty much the bad asses of the street art scene kaws all of these guys will be there tempt 's going to be in the show which is pretty awesome if you see something that 's not possible make it possible everything in this room wasn 't possible this stage this computer and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done thank you guys"
