  "transcript": "it 's my first since bridge and tunnel which i did on broadway and this i thank you i 've excerpted it just for you so here we go hopefully the cellular phone announcement right this was also known as a mobile people of that era would have had an external electronic device right something like this and they all would have carried one of these around with them and amongst their biggest fears was the sheer mortification that one of these might ring at some inopportune moment right so a bit of trivia about that era for you so the format of today 's class is i will be presenting multiple bert modules today from that period in history right so starting circa and remember this was the very first year of the bert program bear in mind i will be living into various different bodies different ages also what were then called races or ethnic groups as you 'll remember from unit one and and along the gender continuum i will be living into males as well it was quite binary at that time laughter i know people still believe ingesting it is better for retention but since we are trying to and also i know it 's challenging if you 're unwilling to nobody 's died and gone to composting early modules in these people 's full identities were protected and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic which for many of them was taboo i said i 'm ready when you are i 'm freezing it i should have brought a shmata i can 't hear you i can 't hear you through the now remind me again you 're recording not only my voice but my feelings no right i 'm ready i just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memory 's doing i was going to tell you you 're too late it 's already bad news what do i think of prostitution are you soliciting me young man i think i have candies in my purse older than eighteen years no well we would have said well it 's not like what you have with the internet might be helped by using some of the pills men can take but so i thought well at the neither of us were very good on the computer we would just call our children or our grandchildren just to see how difficult could it be you search for certain key words and you look oh wow is right young man you can 't imagine what i saw you know how they even got the cameras to capture some of this i couldn 't tell you but the one thing they didn there was lots of making it was all very extreme you know like you would say with the extreme sports never get back again it only showed up on the credit card as entertainment services so my husband was never the wiser and after all of that so next subject is a young woman next subject class is a young woman called bella a university student interviewed in two thousand and sixteen during what was called an intro to feminist porn class as part of her major in sex work at a college in the bay area yeah i just want to like get a recording of like you guys recording me like a meta recording or whatever instagram and my tumblr so like hi guys it 's me bella as you can see from these whatever like electrodes the formation of like they will later be able to reconstitute these as like my own like actual experiences so other people can like actually feel what i 'm feeling right now okay this is what it feels like to be like residual effect of the jell o shots which i had last night it 's called don 't get all we should also focus on your questions also i am like a sex work studies major but minoring in social media with a obviously like a feminist i was named for bella abzug who was like and like also i feel that it is like important to like represent women who are like providing direct sex care services per se as like being a requirement for me to be like an if they enjoy it but like i see myself going forward as more likely like protecting sex workers ' like legal freedoms and rights yeah so like basically i 'm planning on becoming a lawyer right class with a particularly noteworthy relationship to this issue but first will be a west indian woman escort who was recorded at a sex workers ' rights rally and parade she was interviewed whilst marching in full carnival you want me to start talking now yeah i told you you can put those wires anywhere you want to as long as it don 't get in the way yeah no yeah i was telling you you know i think i have in all my time i have had at least one client with that name so this won 't be the first time i had bert all over me but you got to get into the spirit of it if you 're going to interview me all right but you see the sign you get it right so that 's the part where i was telling you is that when i and then i said child if i have to touch another white man 's backside i might as well get paid a lot more money for it than this you pshh you know how hard it is being a domestic worker some of these men they 're heavy you have to pick them up and flip them over you understand well you have to have a sense of humor about it you find me somebody who don 't hate some part of their job i mean there 's a lot of things about this job that i hate but the money is not one of them and i will tell you as long as this is the best possibility for me to make real money i am going to be if that 's what they want to call me my family is from trinidad and the virgin islands i know that they have a chance so i 'm not going to but i 'm going to tell you that i feel paid right that 's grand just a drop more a splash perfect is that i ended up in both and then in the prostitution after that 's right laughter maureen fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore virgin well i 've got this terrible dichotomy doesn 't it i mean half the time when he spoke to us it was just a sort of tell us we were all useless rotten idiots and we had no morals that type of thing by the time i was sixteen and i did as i was told didn 't i and when that got back to me dad he had me sent straightaway to the convent he 'd leave me notes tucked into the holes in the brick at the back of the charity shop so we could meet and i left him a note about it in our special place there and i never did hear from him again no i gave it up for adoption so it could have a decent life no my one sister virginia gave me a surprise surprise i fell in love with another fella much older than me and well he didn 't drink but he did have just the wee heroin problem it wasn 't pretty woman i can tell you that that julia roberts if she 'd ever had to sleep with a man to put a few pounds in her pocket i don 't think she 'd ever you know living like told me and if you legalize it then you 're really telling these girls go on and get lost for a living and a lot of them they 'll do as they 're told all right so four perspectives from four quite four quite different voices there right one woman saying sex itself is natural but the sex industry seems to mechanize or industrialize it then the second woman considered sex work to be empowering liberating and feminist though she herself notably did not seem keen to do it the third woman who actually was a so called sex worker did not agree that it was liberating but she wanted the right to the economic empowerment and then we hear the fourth woman saying not only prostitution itself but proscribed roles for women at risk girl being introduced to the sex industry was twelve or thirteen also consider that the age when all girls in that society first became exposed to sexualized images of women was quite a bit earlier was a doll called barbie right i initially thought she was an educational tool for anorexia prevention but actually she was considered by many to be a wholesome symbol of femininity and often young girls began what was called dieting remember this this was restricting food intake on purpose by the age of six and defining yes excellent point so there was a lucrative market in that society in convincing all people they had to look a certain way to even have a sex life right but girls especially were expected to be of course men were having sex as well but you 'll remember from the reading what were male sluts called very good they were called men though it was not all bad news most women in the early 2000s considered themselves empowered and men generally felt they were also evolved in this area and in fact most people would have been aware of issues like human trafficking for example but they would have seen that as quite separate from more recreational adult entertainment and so we 'll just very briefly class we don 't have a lot of time we 'll just very briefly hear from a man on our topic at this stage so this next subject was interviewed on the night of his bachelor party dude can you all right can you just keep it down i 'm trying to talk to bert right now oh your name 's not bert bert 's the name of toms like of course i believe in women 's rights i 'm marrying a woman my fiancee woman smart woman like the whole we all went to b school together wharton and i can spend it in the parking lot with anderson cooper if i want to first of all stripping but then like all the other things you 're talking about prostitution and all that stuff that 's like not the same thing at all you know like if the girl wants to be an exotic dancer and she 's eighteen like that 's her right you know like my brothers who i 'm close to those guys they 're all like me we and actually like bros before hos it doesn 't mean like what it sounds like like it 's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers and you put them first yeah but if you go watch hangover two and you think that 's an instruction manual for your life like i don 't know what to tell you you know you don 't watch bourne identity and go if you 're a little kid or whatever of course it 's different but i remember one thing like that i was at this kid 's house one time playing gta uh grand theft auto dude are you from canada with grand theft auto kill them and take your money back this kid i remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car and he got all these points i think i don 't think i said anything i just finished playing and went home all right class so then there were men who had more than just a passing relationship to this issue laughter the next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp turned motivational speaker life coach and therapist but if you want to know more about him you 'll have to come to the entire play thank you so much you beautiful ted"
