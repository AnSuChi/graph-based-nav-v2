  "transcript": "the ongoing persecution and operation against the hazaras this persecution has had a long history going back to the late he killed and many others and settled in quetta and it is a tragic story where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends when this story was published in the washington and i was forced to leave afghanistan as my parents once a peaceful haven for the hazaras it had now turned into the most dangerous city in pakistan he later died of his injuries and around three thousand of them were injured so it was not surprising that many wanted to flee largest population of hazaras in the world financially only one of us could leave and it was decided that i would go in the hope that if i arrived i could work to get the rest of my family i met many people who lost loved ones at sea if i had been able to simply fly to australia it would have taken me less than but getting a visa was impossible my journey was much longer much more complicated and certainly more dangerous traveling to thailand by air and then by road and boat paying people and smugglers all the way and spending a lot of time hiding and a lot of time in fear of being caught in indonesia i joined a group of we all shared a bedroom after spending a week in bogor three of my roommates left for the perilous journey and we got the news we found out it made me think am i doing the right thing i concluded i really had no other choice but to go on a few weeks later we got the call from the people smuggler to alert us that the boat is ready for us to commence our sea journey taken in the night towards the main vessel on a motorboat but by the second night the weather turned it was a terrible moment it or maybe like one of those scenes from those hollywood movies that shows that that everything is breaking apart it was happening to us for real the waves were much higher than our boat and the water poured in faster than the motor pumps could take it out and i was documenting it the captain told us that we are not going to make it we have to turn back the boat we went on the deck and turned our torches on and off to attract boat we kept trying to attract their attention attention by waving our life jackets and whistling i slipped into the water the memory card survived we were all scared and confused we hailed a boat from a nearby and then were quickly handed over to indonesian water police at serang detention center an immigration officer came and furtively strip searched us but we kept watching the guards we climbed a tree we put the pillow on that and wrapped our forearms with and we ran away the only thing i had was the memory card with the pictures and footage when my documentary was aired on sbs dateline and they tried to help me they did not allow me to take any other boat to risk my life i also decided to stay in indonesia and process my but i was really afraid that i would end up in indonesia for many years doing nothing and unable to work like every other asylum seeker but it had happened to be a little bit different with me i was lucky my contacts worked to expedite my case through is lucky like me the issue of asylum seekers in australia has been so extremely politicized that it has lost its human the asylum seekers have been demonized and then presented to the people i hope my story and the story of other hazaras could shed some light why they risk their lives to seek asylum thank you"
