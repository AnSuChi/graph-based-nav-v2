  "transcript": "four words that will come to define this century here they are the earth is yes we are a brilliant and creative species but we 've created a little too much stuff so much that our economy is now bigger than its host our planet this is not a philosophical statement this is just science analyses of this but they all draw the same conclusion that we 're living beyond our means the eminent scientists of the global footprint network for example calculate that we need about one point five earths to sustain this economy in other words to keep operating at our current level we need fifty percent more earth than we 've got but of course you can 't borrow natural resources so we 're burning through our capital or stealing from the future so when i say full i mean really full well past any margin for error well past any dispute about methodology what this means is our economy is unsustainable i 'm not saying it 's not nice or pleasant or that it 's bad for polar bears or forests though it certainly is thanks to those pesky laws but that 's not possible you might think we can 't stop it will stop because of the all the systems of the earth which is now having economic damage it is an idea so essential that we tend not to it is based on a crazy idea the crazy idea being that we can it 's game over technology is amazing people are innovative there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things we can surely sort this out we are certainly amazing and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity so if our problem was to get the human economy down from one hundred and fifty percent to one hundred percent we plan to take this make it twice as big and then make it four times as big but in less than forty years in the life time of most of you the only problem with this plan in response some people i find this argument fascinating as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs it 's like the earth doesn 't care what we need mother nature so the idea that we can smoothly transition to a economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in two thousand and fifty a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion it it certainly is but the idea that we can because it means we 're not getting ready for what 's really going to happen happens when you operate a system past its limits and then keep on going at an and that 's what will happen to us but surely we can still stop this if it 's that bad bad we 'll react let 's just think through that idea now we 've had fifty years of warnings we 've had and yet the reality is we 've done pretty much nothing to change course we 're not the story on food on water on soil on climate is all much the same i 've done my grieving about the loss i accept where we are it is sad but it is also time that we ended our denial and recognized that we 're not acting we 're not close to acting and we 're not going to act until this crisis hits the economy and that 's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for so when does this transition i know most people don 't see it that way we tend to look at the world not as the integrated system that it is we see the occupy protests we see spiraling debt crises we see growing inequality we see money 's influence on politics we see resource constraint food and oil it 's the system in the painful process of breaking down our system of debt fueled economic growth of ineffective democracy of overloading planet earth is eating itself alive i could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this but i won 't because if you want to see it that the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question the crisis is now inevitable issue is how will we react of course we can 't know what will happen the future is inherently uncertain but let 's just think through what the science is telling us imagine our economy the oil and coal industries are finished imagine china india and pakistan going to war as climate impacts but with collapsing governments imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why mom and dad what was it like when the oceans were acidifying when oil and food prices were spiking what did you do what were you thinking so how do you feel when the lights go out on the global economy in your when your assumptions about the future fade away and something very different emerges just take a moment and take a breath and think what do you feel at this point fear of course we can 't know what 's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty we are in danger all of us and we 've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response but this time it 's not a tiger at the cave mouth that 's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on because if we wait until the crisis takes hold we may you see those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem the only thing they 're missing when we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things think about war after the bombing of pearl harbor it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry and from there to rationing of food and energy think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy in fact we really are quite amazing but we do love a good crisis and the good news this one 's a monster it could be the beginning of civilization instead and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that scientists like james hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net co2 emissions from the economy i wanted to know what that would take so i worked with professor jorgen randers from norway to find the answer we developed a plan called the one degree war plan so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required co2 emissions from the economy in just twenty years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap we didn 't calculate that precisely but we understand that 's very expensive we can do it we can do it at an affordable cost we can do it with existing political structures the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel and this is where you come in when we think about the future i paint of course we should feel a bit of fear we need to accept the fear and then we need to act we can do this i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do we can be more we can be much more we have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some ten thousand years ago we 've built a powerful foundation of science knowledge and technology more than enough we can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society 's evolution well it 's time to grow up to be wiser to be calmer to be more considered like generations before us we 'll be growing up in war not a war between civilizations but a war for civilization for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier but it will take every entrepreneur every one of us thank you"
