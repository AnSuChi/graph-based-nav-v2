  "transcript": "i 've been a journalist now since i was about seventeen and it 's an interesting industry to be in at the moment because as you all know there 's a huge amount of upheaval going on in media and most of you probably know this from the business angle which is that the business model is pretty screwed and as my grandfather would say it 's and that 's changed because we 've had a huge shift in the balance of power from the news organizations to the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn 't have any way of affecting news or making any change they couldn 't really connect and that 's that 's changed irrevocably my first connection with the news media was i wasn 't happy i was angry i couldn 't see my cartoons so i wrote a letter and it 's a very effective way of ending your your hate still works and that was the round journey it took that long for anyone to have any impact and get some feedback so it 's a real time thing it 's much quicker it 's happening on a constant basis and the journalist is always playing catch up to give an example of how we rely on the audience on the 5th of september in in costa rica an earthquake hit it was a seven point six and this was someone saying temblor which means earthquake thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled all around the world hypothetically had the potential to know that an earthquake was happening we put our status and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream and and in photos instagram fifty eight photos are uploaded to instagram a second more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook and two and a half million more photos on facebook and instagram than when so i should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously and that goes for every single person in this room the only problem is when you have that much information and that can be incredibly difficult when you 're dealing with those volumes and nowhere was this brought home more than during hurricane sandy so what you had in hurricane sandy was a superstorm the likes of which we hadn 't seen for a long time hitting the iphone capital of the universe so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms we had to deal with images from films like the day after tomorrow and we had to deal with images that were so realistic it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all there were images like this one from instagram which was subjected to a grilling by journalists they weren 't really sure it was filtered in instagram the lighting was questioned and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source and in this case these guys were new york food bloggers they were so this one wasn 't a debunk it was actually something that they could prove and that was the job of the journalist it was filtering all this stuff and you were instead of going and finding the information and bringing it back to the reader you were holding back the stuff that was potentially damaging and finding the source becomes more and more important finding the good source and twitter is where most journalists now go it 's like the de facto real time newswire if you know how to use it because there is so much on twitter and a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the egyptian revolution in we could establish were credible were really important and the dots you can see are and as the conversation grew and grew it became more and eventually you were left with this huge big rhythmic pointer of this conversation you could find the nodes though and then you went i 've got to investigate these people these are the ones that are obviously making sense let 's see who they are now in the deluge of information this is where the real time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself because we have more tools than ever and when you start digging into the sources you can go further and further than you ever could before but you 're not one hundred percent sure if you can because you don 't know if the you don 't know if it 's a re upload and you have to do that investigative work and this video which i 'm going to let run through was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago if you 're a news producer this is something you 'd love to run with because obviously this is gold you know this is a fantastic reaction from someone very so we set about going to work on this video and the and we didn 't know if rita existed or if it was a fake name but we started looking and we used free internet tools to do so so we went and we looked for a second free internet tool called wolfram alpha and we found we looked through and we found a house with a swimming pool that looked remarkably like rita 's so we went back to the video to look for clues that we could cross reference so there 's the white lilo there are the two trees though is a little bit less flippant and it has much greater consequences syria has been really interesting for us because obviously a lot of the time you 're trying to debunk so this is where youtube so this video i 'm not going to show you the whole thing because it 's quite gruesome but you 'll hear some of the sounds this is from hama video and what this video shows when you watch the whole thing through is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge so we talked to some sources in hama who we had been back and forth with on twitter and we asked them about this and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify three but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed so the river should actually have been dry so this doesn 't make sense we saw the distinctive railings which we could use we looked at the curbs the curbs were throwing shadows south so we could tell the bridge was running east west across the river it had black and white curbs there 's a divot on the left hand side of the bank and the river we start just literally going through every time that road crosses the river crossing off the bridges that don 't match we 're looking for one that crosses east west and and we zoom right in we start to see that it 's got the first the one who said the bridge wasn 't in hama and the one guy who said yes the bridge does exist but i 'm not sure about the water levels number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden and we 've been able to find that out using some free internet tools sitting in a cubicle in an office in dublin there 's so much information there that it 's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day you can find out incredible information given a couple of clues i could probably find out of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out but and computers that are quicker than ever before"
