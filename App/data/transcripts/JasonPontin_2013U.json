  "transcript": "armstrong and aldrin were collective effort the apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the united states to get to the moon nasa spent around one hundred and eighty billion dollars in today 's money or four percent of the federal budget apollo employed around four hundred thousand people but following the death of armstrong last year is now the most senior so eight hundred and forty one pounds of old rocks and something all later emphasized a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home why did they go the cynical answer is they went because president kennedy wanted to show the soviets that his nation had the better rockets kennedy 's own words at rice university provide a better clue why some say we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things but because they are hard jason pontin to contemporaries apollo wasn 't only a victory of west over east in the cold war at the time the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology they went because it was a big thing to do landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs the first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis in the years of the century polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated technology itself seemed to possess what alvin toffler in one thousand nine hundred and seventy called accelerative thrust for most of human history we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail no one has traveled faster than the crew of apollo ten and blithe optimism about technology 's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve such creating clean energy curing cancer or feeding the world have come to seem i remember watching the liftoff of apollo seventeen i was five years old and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a saturn v rocket but i was absolutely certain there would be mars colonies in my lifetime so something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology has become a we 've heard it over the last two days here at ted it feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys with things like iphones and apps and social media or algorithms that speed automated trading but they they don 't solve humanity 's big problems which silicon valley says the markets are to blame in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs silicon valley says that venture investing shifted mostly explains what 's wrong with silicon valley even when venture capitalists were at their most risk happy they preferred small investments tiny investments that offered an exit within ten years v c s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy and funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value no the reasons we can 't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound nasa even has the but going to mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal and that will never happen we won 't go to mars because everyone thinks there are more important things sometimes we can 't solve big problems because our political systems fail today less than two percent of the world 's energy consumption derives from advanced renewable sources such as solar wind and biofuels coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so but thirty years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food but there will be famines so long president nixon declared war on cancer in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one and it is only in the last ten years that effective viable therapies have come to seem real hard problems are hard we can we must but these four elements must all be present political leaders and the public must care to solve a and we must understand it but it is an irreproducible model for the future it is not one thousand nine hundred and there is no galvanizing contest like the cold war no politician like john kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system thank you very much"
