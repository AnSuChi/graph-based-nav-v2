  "transcript": "so many memories come back to me it 's like after every exam when i walk out the teacher would say hey come how did you do so i remember those nights i used to go to sleep with asking help from [ the ] unknown because for some reason i couldn 't believe what my father and mother hanged in the puja room as a god because my friend 's family i thought i guess i 'll pray to [ the ] unknown and ask help and started getting help from everywhere each and every corner of my life at that time my brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting then when i was in eighth standard job in one of the signboard artists called putu and then school also started supporting me oh he 's bad at studies but let him send to the drawing competitions so it was good to survive with that little tool that i found to find my own place in school and one of those competitions i just won a small little transistor philips radio and and i was thirteen and i was listening to just radio and someone happened to sit next to me like these three people are sitting here you know like college of arts i think you should study in a school of art you just quit school and come there whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life it 's possible it is that we need we need to be open and fine tuned so that 's what made me ] college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what i really want to do with art work or art on what happened between that time and now here the last ten fifteen years i can see that most of the works revolve around three and i just start out with a trace because so i was thinking but when you look at the past the way to understand the past is only by the traces available because we cannot go back [ to ] the past or it can be painting or drawing or writing whatever it is but it is just a kind of trace of that time and that fascinated me to explore that so i was working on the line but instead of so here are some of the works i would like to show you so so here what happened then you know what i really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a so close to one 's it 's such a great experience because we have freedom of like walking or moving my hand or moving around in the space but the moment this becomes solid so so i just thought i 'm going to capture this is the trace of fire because when i was capturing traces you know this thought comes to me always is it only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace or is there other ways to capture it so this work is nothing but like because of the focal length of the so this is called dawn to dawn what i did here i just put like ten feet [ of ] paper so wherever the fire is eating the paper that 's what becomes the work detail so do we really understand what it is or are we trying to get what we think it then move towards questioning the perception because even though there are traces when you try to understand them you know you play a major role so like let 's say even a simple act how many of you saw a cow crossing in india while you were coming from bangalore to mysore can you just raise the hand if you just ask an opinion of how she 'll simply say to get to the other side why the cow was crossing the road the answer can be so different if potter said it he would say for the greater good without having their motives called into question and he sees the same cow walking around the street he would definitely say and he said unto the cow ' thou shalt cross the road and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow freud would say the fact that you 're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity or the road moved underneath the cow depends on your frame of reference he would say asking this question denies your own nature we don 't see what it is it just all depends on one 's perception and it 's just created by the mind if you look at this piece of paper but if you tear it in the middle even when we say dark light the way we train to so this work from this period is mostly like you know this is so the lamp is not just giving a light it 's also giving a darkness so this is a work of art which is just trying to explore that this is called limit out this shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch do we really see but it just appears like it 's coming out of the wall you know the wall almost like again inward out it 's a full figure cast from myself it 's about eight inches deep when i was doing that i always wondered since i 've worked with creators and now you know i 've moved to questioning the perception it just makes me feel like which as a human we don 't see them is there any way to capture the thought but a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about seven months in the restroom when i was changing the air freshener saying dear sir i am an artist this is my catalogue will you help me to make this sculpture then i thought i will go to the small scale industries facilitating unit and ask help so i told them i 'd like to start an air freshener company finally i went back to them and said it 's not for starting the company it 's just to make my own work please come for the show and they did devi art foundation in delhi and this was collected by anupam which is like finally in the end he will not have anything because it 's just all about questioning the preconceptions so if someone says oh i see the portrait it 's in the air it 's in the same gallery or in the same museum so but they are not aware of it while i was doing that work my mom and my dad they were looking at it and they said why do you deal with negative subjects all the time and i was like what do you mean light makes dark and now evaporating self don 't you think it remained something about it 's merged with the whole because we can or we can break the sculpture and get the dust but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe it 's called emerging angel this is the first day it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other this is after fifteen twenty days through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one so what you see now is called shadow foreshadow and what i 'd like to tell you we see where it 's bouncing but we don 't see when it 's bounced on the moon we see it the same thing in the darkroom the little dust particle will reflect the light and we realize we don 't see electricity i just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there because as a visual artist if i 'm seeing this and i 'm seeing that but how to sculpt this you the skin of this is also representing this and skin at the other end also represents the floor i did this as then the second one the moment you bring any then i thought okay let me sculpt that throwing light and then again at that point there is no shadow i thought oh good work is finished this is called so that hole actually makes the air come out and go in this is called kaayam and what i 'd like to tell you so all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses so my request was like is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign and to really get to the point we should"
