  "transcript": "our ancestors looked up at the night sky and wondered what stars are wondering therefore how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know they wished they knew and how they could rest when they were tired without i bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know in every aspect of their lives they wished for progress just as we do but they failed almost completely to make any they didn 't know how to discoveries like fire happened so rarely that from an individual 's point of view the world never improved nothing new was learned the first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as think how many discoveries nuclei and nuclear reactions of course that ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explained starlight and that all that discovered in forty years had not been in the previous hundred thousand was not for lack of thinking about stars and all those other urgent problems they had they even arrived yet the tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn 't sufficiently recognized i think these were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did but that ability until or so we should hope because that event was the scientific revolution ever since which our knowledge of the physical world and of how to adapt it to our wishes has been growing relentlessly now what had changed what were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid open ended discovery how to make that difference is surely the most important worryingly there is no consensus about what it is so i 'll tell you but i 'll have to backtrack a little first before the scientific revolution they believed that everything important knowable was already known enshrined in ancient writings so they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little and therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of learned men priests traditions and rulers which is why the scientific revolution had to have a wider context the enlightenment a revolution in how people sought knowledge trying not to rely on take no one 's word for it but that can 't be what made the difference authorities had been rejected before many times and that rarely if ever caused anything like the scientific revolution at the time what they thought distinguished science we 've seen that that can 't be true it did help by promoting observation and experiment but from the outset it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it the book of nature is written look at the world you don 't see equations carved on to the mountainsides if you did it would be because people had carved them by the way why don 't we do that what 's wrong with us empiricism is inadequate because well scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen you have to admit doesn 't come to us through the senses we don 't see we don 't see but we know about those things the classic empiricist answer is induction the unseen resembles the seen but it doesn 't you know what the clinching evidence was that is curved it was a photograph not of space time but of an eclipse with a dot there rather than there and the evidence for evolution some rocks and some finches bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects so you admit it 's all interpretation no one has ever seen evolution we see ours from the bible but what creationist and empiricists both ignore no one has ever seen a bible either that the eye only namely electrical crackles so we perceive nothing as what it really is our connection to reality is never just perception tested by observation not derived from it so were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates she is magically compelled to return and her mother demeter goddess of the earth and makes it cold and barren then it must happen everywhere on earth simultaneously so if the ancient greeks had only known that australia is at its warmest when demeter is at her saddest they 'd have known that their theory is false so what was wrong with that that momentous difference i think there is one thing you have to care about and that implies testability the scientific method the enlightenment and everything and here is the crucial thing there is such a thing as a defect in a story i don 't just mean a logical defect i mean a bad explanation what does that mean that accounts for what 's seen because the explanatory role of persephone 's marriage contract why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual and returns every spring to take revenge on hades with her spring powers venting heat up to the surface creating yet what it asserts about reality this easy because without a functional reason to prefer one of advocating one of them in preference to the others is irrational seek the ones that can 't be easily varied while still explaining the phenomena now our current explanation of seasons is that the earth 's axis is tilted like that and away for the other half better put that up hard to vary because every detail plays a functional role for instance we know independently of seasons that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat and the tilt also explains the sun 's angle of elevation at different times of year and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres if they 'd been observed in phase hard to vary makes the crucial difference if the ancient greeks had found found out about seasons in australia they could have easily varied their myth to predict that being proved wrong by observation and changing their theory accordingly still wouldn 't have got the ancient greeks one jot closer to understanding and it 's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it 's testable if the axis tilt untestable theories but the more important one is explanationless theories whenever you 're told that some existing statistical trend will continue what causes that trend you 're being told a wizard did it hard to vary"
