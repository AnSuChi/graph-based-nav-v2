  "transcript": "i 'm going to tell you about an affliction i suffer from and i have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well rooms and rooms full of paintings after about fifteen or twenty minutes instead i 'm thinking about that cup of coffee i desperately need to wake me up i 'm suffering from gallery fatigue how many of you out there suffer from yes ha ha ha ha now sometimes you might last longer than twenty minutes or but i think we all suffer from it and do you have the accompanying guilt for me i look at the paintings on the wall and i think somebody has decided to put them there thinks they 're good enough and and that 's not a good experience leave a gallery like that the thing is i think we should give ourselves a break if you think about going into a restaurant if you go into a department store to buy a shirt are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt of course not you can be selective it 's expected why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting well i 'm trying to take a different approach and there 's two things i do when i go into a gallery first of all i go quite fast and i and i pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other i don 't even know why they make me slow down but something pulls me like a magnet it might just be one painting in fifty well i think that we are our dna tells us to tell stories we tell stories all the time about everything and i think we do it why not apply that so i now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries there are three paintings i 'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them the first one needs little introduction girl with a pearl earring by johannes vermeer dutch painter this is the most glorious painting it 's accompanied me everywhere i 've gone i never tire of looking at her but i think what 's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing and that is and i change my mind all the time so that keeps me coming back i wonder what did to her to make her look like that always before i 'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl so i went to find out i did some research and discovered which made me go yippee i can do whatever i want i can come up with whatever story i want to so here 's how i came up with the story how does vermeer know her well there 've been suggestions that she is his 12 year old daughter and i thought no it 's a very intimate look but it 's not a look a daughter gives her father for one thing in dutch painting of the time if a woman 's mouth was open it was indicating sexual availability it would have been inappropriate for vermeer to paint his daughter like that so it 's not his daughter but it 's somebody well who else would be in the house so she 's in the house how do we get her into the studio he also had eleven it would have been a chaotic noisy household and if you 've seen vermeer 's paintings before you know that they 're incredibly calm and quiet how does a painter paint such calm quiet paintings with eleven kids around well he compartmentalizes his life he gets to his studio and he says nobody okay the maid can come in and clean they 're together and he decides to paint her silk fur very sumptuous materials this is very plain the only thing that isn 't plain is her pearl earring whose are they we happen to know there 's a list of catharina the wife 's clothes amongst them a yellow and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings different women in the she 's in the studio with him for a long time these paintings took a long time to make they would have time alone all that time she 's wearing his wife 's pearl earring she 's gorgeous she obviously loves him she 's conflicted and does the wife know maybe not and if she doesn 't well that 's the story laughter the next painting i 'm going to talk about is called boy building a house of cards by chardin he 's an i like this version the best because some of the boys are older and some are younger and to me this one like goldilocks 's porridge is just right he 's not quite a child and i found that when i was looking at it i was standing there going so i was thinking of a story where if i 'm in this position who could there looking at him not the painter i don 't want to think about the painter i 'm but not not really and we come back again and again the last painting i 'm going to talk about is called anonymous by anonymous and then they discovered that it wasn 't him and they have no idea who it is this orphan spends most of his time in storage along with quite a number of other orphans some of them some beautiful paintings made me stop in my tracks he 's not happy and why isn 't he happy the second thing that really attracted me he is blushing he 's the third thing and you know what it makes me think of is it 's sort of snug and puffy it 's like a duvet spread over a bed if i 'm going to make a story what 's the last thing i 'm going to put in there well what would a tudor gentleman be preoccupied with and i thought well henry viii okay he 'd be preoccupied with his inheritance with his heir who is going to inherit his name and his fortune you put all those it 's short rosy it has a plain high collar detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread set close together so that the fit is snug the doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed perhaps that was the intention i first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor i knew even before i stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed i have always flushed easily from physical exertion from wine from high emotion as a boy i would not allow anyone else he managed to make the word tender when i made the announcement george did not turn rosy but went pale as my but it is difficult to hear the words aloud i know i could barely utter them i found george on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden he was still pale we stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces what do you think of my doublet he glanced at me that collar looks to be strangling you we will still see each other i insisted we can still hunt and play cards and attend court nothing need change george did not speak it is expected of me i 'm sure you 'll be thank you"
