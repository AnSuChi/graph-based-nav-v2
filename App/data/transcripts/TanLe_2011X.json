  "transcript": "how can i speak in ten minutes about the bonds of women over three generations four year old girl huddled with her young sister her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than thirty years ago bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go this is not a finished story it is a puzzle still being put together a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope imagine him as the communists enter saigon confronting words for so long his friends now mocked him he died broken by history i never knew him in real life but our lives are much more than our memories my grandmother never let me forget his life my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain but we endured the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn my mother mai was eighteen when her father died already with two small girls for her life had distilled itself into one task the escape of her family and a new life in australia it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed so after a four year saga that defies fiction a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel all the adults knew the risks the greatest fear was of pirates rape and death my mother carried a small bottle of poison my first memories are from the boat the vast and empty horizon i don 't remember the pirates who came but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the malaysian coast and the first apple i tasted given to me by the men on apple has ever tasted the same unlike the settled and the snippets of halting english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common then on a car assembly line working six days double shifts time to study english and gain it qualifications we were poor all the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in english and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out which was usually new clothes a school uniform down and there were rare but searing chants of slit eye and the occasional graffiti asian go home go home to where something stiffened inside me there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying i will bypass you my mother my sister and i and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her she opened a computer store studied to be a beautician and opened another business and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition centers were established i lived in parallel worlds relentless in the demands that i made on myself i was chosen as the young australian of the year and i was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another and their edges didn 't fit invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb a grandmother a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost twenty years telling one another the story of their day i told my mother i couldn 't do it she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat no had never been an option just do it she said and don 't be what you 're not and the more candidly i spoke the more i was asked to speak and even though i finished my degree i realized i could not settle into a career in law there had to be another piece of the jigsaw a recent arrival new on the scene and not just ok because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons but not in the way that you fear possibilities that would not have been allowed were a strange mixture of humility and daring so i followed my hunches i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label it can 't be done was an irresistible challenge for a year we were penniless at the end of each day i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared i made the decision to move to the us after only one trip my hunches again and the adventure has continued let me tell you about my grandmother she grew up at a time when confucianism was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered life hadn 't changed for centuries her father died soon after she was born her mother raised her alone at seventeen she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her with no support from her husband she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case and a far greater sensation when she won i was taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her she asked the monk why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold because you have been holding it since this morning he said you have not let it go defeat would have come too easily now i would like to have my own children and i wonder about the boat who could ever wish it on their own yet i am afraid of privilege of ease of entitlement but if i could give i would"
