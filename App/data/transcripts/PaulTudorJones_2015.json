  "transcript": "it 's a system i love because of the successes and opportunities it 's afforded me and millions of others i started in cotton in particular in the pits and if there was ever a free market free for all this was it where men wearing ties but acting like gladiators fought literally and physically for a profit fortunately i was good enough that by the time i was thirty i was able to move into the upstairs world of money management where i spent the next three decades as a and i 've traded a lot of crazy manias and unfortunately over the past fifty we as a society have come to view our companies and corporations in a very narrow almost monomaniacal fashion and we have put so much emphasis on profits on short term quarterly earnings and share prices at the exclusion of all else it 's like we 've ripped the humanity out of our companies now we don 't do that conveniently reduce something to a set of numbers that you can play with like lego toys we don 't do that in our individual life we don 't treat somebody or value them based on their monthly income it 's threatening the very underpinnings of our society and here 's how you 'll see this chart is corporate profit margins going back forty years as a percentage of revenues and you can see that we 're at a 40 year high but if you 're the other side of that and you 're the average american worker higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth what they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality but intuitively that makes sense right because if the top ten percent of american families own ninety percent then there 's less wealth left for the rest of society made by the equality trust shows twenty one countries from austria to japan to new zealand the greater the income inequality now those of you in the audience where does the united states rank where does it lie on that chart and guess what we 're literally off the chart that 's us with the greatest income inequality and that 's none of those are on my bucket list and that 's by increasing justness in corporate behavior and like an addict trying to kick a habit the first step is to acknowledge that you here 's a small but startling example of exactly how we 're doing that this chart shows corporate giving as a percentage juxtapose that to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins and i ask you does that feel right in all fairness when i started writing this i thought oh wow what does my company what does tudor do and i realized we give one percent of corporate profits to charity every year and i 'm supposed to be a philanthropist when i realized that i literally wanted to throw up but the point is this mania is so deeply entrenched that well intentioned people like myself don 't even realize that we 're part of it now we 're not going to change corporate behavior by simply increasing and oh by the way we 've since quadrupled and that 's the free market system about a year ago some friends of mine and i started a not for profit called just capital its mission is very simple to help companies and corporations learn how to operate in a more just fashion and that 's where just capital comes in because beginning this year and every year we 'll be conducting a nationwide survey of a representative sample of twenty thousand americans to find out exactly what they think are the criteria for justness in in corporate behavior and maybe we 'll find out that the most important thing for the public is that we create living wage jobs or make healthy products or help not harm the environment but we have one hundred percent confidence and faith in the american public to get it right and then next year we 'll poll again and we 'll take the additive step this time of ranking the one thousand largest u s companies from number one to number one thousand and everything in between we and maybe over time we 'll find out that as people come to know which companies are the most just human and economic resources will be driven now capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that 's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in capitalism has to be based on justice it has to be and now more than ever with economic divisions growing wider every day 's estimated that forty seven percent of american workers can be displaced in the next twenty years i 'm but i 'm pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits has to come greater corporate social responsibility the father of capitalism the great the immense fabric of human society must in a moment crumble and there was a problem my mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say have mercy now 's not the time for us for the rest of us to show them mercy the time is now for us to show them fairness and we can do that you and i by starting where we work in the businesses that we operate in and when we put justness on par get the most wonderful thing"
