  "transcript": "and my area of expertise is computer and information security i had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother describing to one of her fellow senior citizens i was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university and it was interesting to get her perspective but that 's not the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard anyone say about my work the most ridiculous thing i ever and she asked me if and she was very concerned that she might get sick from it that she could get this virus but if she felt more comfortable she be free to use latex gloves when she was on the computer and there would be no harm whatsoever in that i 'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get a virus from your computer in a serious way which i don 't think most people know about none of the work is my work it 's all work that my colleagues have done and i actually asked them for their slides and incorporated them into this talk so the first one i 'm going to talk about are implanted medical devices now medical devices have come a long way technologically you can see was invented one thousand nine hundred and sixty the first internal pacemaker was implanted hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there and the technology has continued to move forward in two thousand and six we hit an important milestone from the perspective of because that 's when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities one thing that brings us close to home is we look at dick cheney 's device he had a device that pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart and as you can see at the bottom there it was controlled by a computer controller and if you ever thought that software liability was very important get one of these inside of you and what this research team did is they reverse engineered the wireless and so they went and they got some ground beef and some bacon and they wrapped it all up to about the size of a human being 's they launched many many successful attacks one that and they were able to change therapies including disabling the device and this is with a real commercial off the shelf device simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it there was a piece on npr that some of could actually have their performance disrupted simply by holding a pair of headphones onto them now wireless and the internet can improve health care greatly there 's several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside there 's a lot of danger in this okay let me shift gears and show you another target i 'm going to show you a few different targets like this and that 's my talk so we 'll look at automobiles more pentiums than my lab did when i there 's actually wi fi there 's sensors in the wheels that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure to a controller on board the modern car is a sophisticated now they have two areas they can attack one is short range wireless where you can actually communicate with the device from nearby either through bluetooth or wi fi and the other is long range where you can communicate with the car through the cellular network or through one of the radio stations think about it when a car receives the way that the researchers did this work is they read the software in and then they built exploits to exploit those they actually carried out their attack in real life they bought two cars and i guess they have better budgets than i do the first threat model was to see what someone could do if an attacker actually got and then they leave and now what kind of trouble are you in the other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular or something like that never having actually gotten physical access to and they connected to the diagnostic unit on the in car network and they did all kinds of silly things like here 's a picture of the speedometer showing one hundred and forty miles an hour when the car 's in park once you have control of the car 's computers you can do anything now you might say okay that 's silly well what if you make the car always say it 's going twenty miles an hour slower than it 's actually going you might produce a lot of speeding tickets then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars the target victim car and the chase car and they launched a bunch of other attacks simply by hacking the computer they were able to disable the brakes they also were able to install malware that wouldn 't kick in and wouldn 't trigger until the car was doing something like going over twenty miles an hour or something like that how would you steal a car in this model well you compromise the car by a buffer overflow of vulnerability in the software something like that and so that 's something that the drivers of the car would never know was happening am i scaring you yet got a few more of these interesting ones these are ones where i went to a conference and my mind was just blown and i said i have to share this with other people but kind of surprising they videotaped people on a bus and then they the video what you see here in number one is a reflection in somebody 's glasses of the smartphone that they 're typing in and you may know on your smartphone and they were able to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing and had a language model for detecting typing and then they had a surprising result which is that their software had not only done it for their target but other people who accidentally happened to be in the picture they were able to produce what those people had been typing and that was kind of an accidental artifact of what their radios are used by law enforcement and all kinds of government agencies and people in combat to communicate and there 's an encryption option on these phones this is what the phone looks like and you can see that they 're used by secret service they 're used in combat it 's a very very common standard in the u s and elsewhere so one question the researchers asked themselves is could you block this thing right could you they found that there 's this girltech device used for texting that happens to operate at the same exact frequency as the p25 and they built what they called my first jammer and now i 'll go back you see the difference this is plain text and so the researchers asked themselves i wonder how many times very secure important sensitive conversations are happening on these two way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don 't notice that they didn 't encrypt so they bought a scanner these are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the p25 and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in if they found encrypted communication they stayed on that channel and they wrote down that 's a channel that these people communicate in these law enforcement agencies and what kind of things were people talking about well they found the names and information about confidential sensitive information it was mostly law enforcement and criminal they went and reported this to the law enforcement agencies after anonymizing it and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface wasn 't good enough if you 're talking about something really secure and sensitive it should be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted that one 's pretty easy to fix the last one i thought was really really cool and i just had to show it to you it but but no one up till this point had looked at the accelerometer the accelerometer is the thing that determines the vertical and then their goal was to use the vibrations that were created by typing to measure the change in the accelerometer reading now when they tried this on an iphone 3gs this is a graph of the perturbations that were and so the same measurement produced this graph now that gave you a lot of information while someone was typing and what they did then is used advanced artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning to have a training phase so they got most likely grad students to type in a whole lot of things and and then there 's the attack phase where you get somebody to type something in you don 't know what it was but you use your model that you created in the training phase to figure out what they were typing they typed in the illinois supreme court has ruled that rahm emanuel is eligible to run for mayor of chicago and ordered him to stay on the ballot now the system is interesting because it produced illinois supreme and then it wasn 't sure the model produced a bunch of and this is the beauty of of some of the a i techniques is that computers are good at some things humans are good at other things take the best of both and let the humans solve this one don 't waste computer cycles and then later recover what they did even without using the microphone if someone is able to put malware on your iphone they could then maybe get the typing that you the sequoia pac man game i think that society tends to adopt technology really quickly i love the next coolest gadget and so you need to think outside of the box"
