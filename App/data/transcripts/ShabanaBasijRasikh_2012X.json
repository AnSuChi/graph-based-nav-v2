  "transcript": "i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly depressed him but i could see that my father was very very happy you can go to a real school now he said a morning that i will never forget a real school you see i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school so for the next five years i dressed as a boy to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school it was the only way we both could be educated each day we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping more than one hundred of us packed in one small living room it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer the students and our parents from time to time the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because taliban were suspicious we always wondered what they knew about us were we being followed do they know where we live but still school was where we wanted to be i was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time he insisted that his daughter my mom but my educated mother became a teacher there she is and my father that 's him there was no question that his children would there was greater risk in not educating his children during taliban years i remember there were times i would get so frustrated by our life but my father he would say listen my daughter you can lose everything you own in your life but the one thing that will always remain with you you is what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees we will so do you still not want to continue today i am twenty two i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school i stand here a proud graduate of middlebury college he not only brags about my college degree but also that i was the first woman and that i am the first woman to drive him through but my family dreams even bigger for me that 's why i am a global ambassador for 10x10 a global campaign to educate women that 's why i cofounded sola the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in afghanistan a country where it 's still risky for girls to go to school the exciting thing is that i see students at my school and i see their parents and their fathers who like my own advocate for them in the face of daunting opposition and i cannot show you his face but ahmed is the father of one of my students he and his daughter were on on their way from sola to their village and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes as he arrived home the phone rang a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school they would try again kill me now if you wish will not ruin my daughter 's future because of your old and backward ideas what i 've come to realize about afghanistan and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most most of us who succeed is a father recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success it 's not to say that our mothers aren 't key in our success in fact they 're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters but in the context of a society like in afghanistan we must have the support of men under the taliban girls who went to school more than three million girls are in school in afghanistan i find that americans see the fragility i fear that these changes will not last when i see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them i see a promising future and lasting change and every single day the girls of sola remind me of that they are dreaming big"
