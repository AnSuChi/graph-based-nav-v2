  "transcript": "as innocent as that name sounds these are the philanthropists scientists who sort of shape our world and what could i possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that and so i thought perhaps a really civilized sounding british accent might help things a bit and then i thought no no i should just get up there and be myself and and just talk the way i really talk because after all this although many of you already know that i do speak the queen 's english because i am from queens new york but the theme of this session of course is invention and while i don 't have any patents that i 'm aware of you will be meeting a few of my inventions today i suppose it 's fair to say that i am interested in the invention of self or selves but then what to what extent do we how do we and how mutable is that identity like what if one could be anyone at any allow me to play with the spaces between those questions and so i 've brought a couple of them with me and what i should tell you what i should tell you is that they 've each prepared their own little ted good evening everybody thank you so very much for having me here today ah thank you very much my name is lorraine levine i am here because of a young girl sarah jones she 's a very nice young black girl but anyway she has me here because she she puts me in her show what she calls her one woman that means it 's amazing not only of course the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities there are so many celebrities running around here i saw and she was getting a yogurt in the google cafe isn 't that adorable and oh i saw she 's only half jewish did you know that about but anyway i should have started by saying just how lucky i feel it 's such an eye opening experience to be here you 're all so responsible for this world that we live in today you know i couldn 't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl but i i also appreciate the diversity that you have here i noticed it 's very multicultural you know when you 're standing up here you can see all the different people it 's like a rainbow the different things what are you allowed to say or not say i just i don 't want to offend anybody you you know i just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people literally some of you the architects building our absolutely horrifying you know between the environmental degradation and the the crashing of the world markets you 're talking about and of course we know it 's all because of the all the well i don 't know how else to just say it my way the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the you know the bankers and the wall street you know it anyway the point is i 'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess so i salute each of you and your stellar achievements thank you for all that you do and congratulations on being such big makhers that you 've become ted meisters continued success congratulations mazel tov hi thank you everybody sorry and i 'm just i 'm so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you 're doing and everything like that but i don 't know if there 's any other dominican people here but i know that juan enriquez he was here yesterday and i think he 's mexican so that 's honestly that 's close enough for me right now so i just i 'm sorry i 'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything and i just used to doing the public speaking and take a deep breath okay sorry so what i was trying to say is that i really love ted like i love everything about this and actually i can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything because actually i 'm a sophomore at college right and the organization is called da bomb a \\ and da bomb not like what you guys can build and everything it 's like da bomb it means like dominican it 's an acronym benevolent organization for mothers and babies basically like da bomb what dominican american benevolent organization for mothers and babies does basically we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me i am a working mother and i also go to school full time and but like even at my job like i just got promoted right now it 's very exciting actually for me because i 'm the junior assistant to the associate director under the senior vice president for business development that 's my new title and if everybody like all people two weeks so we deserve just as much and i just privately now in the future i 'm going to think of ted as an acronym for these are folks who are based on real people from my real life neighbors family members i come from a multicultural family in but on top of my family background my parents also sent me to the united nations school where i encountered okay well you know it was beginner you know and you know the existential i took german for three years [ german ] and even in the un school although you know it was wonderful the teacher herr schtopf he never discriminated never he always always treated each of us you know equally unbearably so there were the teachers and then there were my friends classmates from everywhere and they 've inspired many characters as well for example a friend of mine well i just wanted to quickly say good evening my name is praveen manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity of course ted the reputation precedes itself all over the world but you know i am originally from india and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california and usually my work it takes me to washington d c and there i must attend these meetings mingling with some tiresome politicians trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in georgetown so you can just imagine right so but i 'm thrilled to to be joining all of you here i wish we had more time together but that 's for another time okay i don 't think we 'll have time for you to meet everybody i brought but i but i do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize if my name is pauline ning and but when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted you know first i don 't know you would not find me in front of an audience of people much less like this i do not have but then i decided just like my daughter my daughter wrote that she told me always start your speech with humor but my background my husband and i we brought our son and daughter here to have the freedom we cannot have in china at that time and we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition but it 's very hard you know and they would always answer me back in english pop culture american culture but when they got older when the time comes for them to start think about getting married that 's when we expect them to realize a little bit more their own culture but that 's where we had some problems but she is american woman not chinese it 's not that it 's bad but i told him what 's wrong with a chinese woman i will concentrate on my daughter the daughter 's marriage is very special to the mom and then so i said what 's wrong in this picture you don 't have to worry about boys because i don 't like them and i said men can be difficult but all women have to get used to that i mean i don 't like boys i like girls i am lesbian but i told my daughter that this is one exception that she is not gay she is just confused but she it 's not american she said she is in love in love with a nice chinese girl these are the words i am waiting to hear but from my son not my daughter but then over time i have come to understand that this this is who she is so even though i will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant usually because of places like this because of ideas like this and people like you with an open mind so i think maybe my name is habbi belahal and i would like to first of all thank sarah jones for putting all of the pressure on the only arab who she brought with her to be last today it is not harvard but i feel a bit like a fish out of water but i am very proud of my students and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference so you will get the extra credit i promised you but while i know that i may not look like the typical ted izen as you would say i do like to make the point that we in global society we are never as different as the appearances may suggest i will share quickly with you a back in the ancient times and when i touch you i so but please if it is sounding familiar it is because i was at the same time in my life listening to the beatles on the radio say that i like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another and i pray that this is the way that we will you very much for the opportunity okay for having me here"
