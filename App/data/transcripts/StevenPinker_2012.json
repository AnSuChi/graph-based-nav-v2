  "transcript": "reason appears to have fallen on hard times psychic hotlines and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism and even in the academy there are attacks on the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking sp but is this necessarily a bad thing perhaps reason is overrated many pundits have argued that a good heart and steadfast moral clarity are superior and wasn 't it reason that gave us the means to despoil the planet and threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction besides a human being is not a brain on a stick my fellow psychologists have shown that we 're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact rng how could a reasoned argument logically entail the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments look you 're trying to persuade us of reason 's impotence you 're not threatening us or bribing us suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest by the very act of trying to reason us into your position you 're conceding reason 's potency reason isn 't up for grabs here it can 't be you show up for that debate and you 've already lost it sp but can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste rng all the answer is no but it doesn 't take much to switch it to yes you need two conditions the first is that reasoners all care about their own well being that 's one of the passions that has to be present in order for reason to go and it 's obviously present in all of us we all care passionately about our own well being the second condition is that reasoners are members of a community of reasoners who can affect one another 's well being can exchange messages and comprehend each other 's reasoning but has it worked that way in practice in particular can it explain a momentous historical development that i spoke about five years ago here at the executions were designed to be as prolonged and as painful as possible like crucifixion respectable people kept slaves for all our flaws we have abandoned these barbaric practices rng so do you think it 's human nature that 's changed sp self control empathy a sense of fairness what abraham lincoln called the better angels of our nature rng so if human nature didn 't change what invigorated those better angels sp well among other things our circle of empathy expanded the tribe the nation really give so much credit to soft hearted empathy sp they can and do like the empathic civilization and the age of empathy i 'm all for empathy i mean who isn 't but all on its own it 's and even our best attempts to work up sympathy for those who are unconnected with us fall miserably short a sad truth about human nature that was pointed out by adam smith adam smith let and when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed he would pursue his business or his pleasure with the same ease and tranquility as if no such accident had happened if he was to lose he would snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren sp you didn 't mention what might be one of our most effective better angels every one of the humanitarian developments that you mentioned originated with thinkers who gave reasons for why some practice was indefensible demonstrated that the way people treated some particular group of others was logically inconsistent with the way they insisted on being treated themselves sp are you saying that reason can actually change people 's minds don 't people just stick with whatever conviction serves their interests or conforms to the culture that they grew up in rng here 's a and if you look at the history of moral progress you can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments to changes in the way that we actually feel time and again a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons and at dinner parties popular opinion eventually their conclusions get absorbed into the common sense of decency erasing the tracks of the original argument that had gotten us there few of us today feel any need to put forth a rigorous philosophical argument as to why slavery is wrong or public hangings or beating children but just those arguments had to be made and they were in centuries past sp castellio making the case but then why does he write so many books about manifest truth since each is sure of himself sp or with hideous punishments like breaking on the wheel rng the prohibition in our constitution of cruel and unusual punishments was a response to a pamphlet circulated in one thousand seven by the italian jurist cesare beccaria cesare and after a hundred years of cruel punishments breaking on the wheel causes no more fear than imprisonment previously did it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime and into this calculation and therefore tyrannical sp but surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war rng no doubt but modern anti war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war erasmus erasmus the advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide redounds only to a few and those unworthy of reaping it one man 's safety is owing to the destruction of another one man 's prize is derived from the plunder of another the cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning and whatever on the contrary is called good fortune is a savage and a cruel good fortune an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence and it only became popular john locke bucked the tide of millennia that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural he argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government john locke freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by common to everyone of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it arbitrary will of another man as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint but the law of nature sp those words sound familiar where have i read them before ah how comes it to be so in a since no reason can be alleged for the one that will not hold more strongly for the other if all men are born free how is it that all women are born slaves arbitrary will of men be the perfect condition of slavery rng that sort of all in the job description of it becomes increasingly uncomfortable gay rights and even animal but fully two centuries before the enlightenment thinker jeremy bentham had exposed the practices such as the cruelty to animals jeremy bentham the but can they suffer rng and the persecution of homosexuals jb totally different in its nature of effects it 's a personal injury it 's a kind of rape but this practice produces not pain of any kind to anyone sp still it took at least a century for the arguments of these great thinkers to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole it kind of makes you wonder about our own time are there practices that we engage in where the arguments against them are there for all to see but nonetheless we persist in them rng when our great grandchildren look back at us will they be as appalled by some of our practices as we are by our i 'm sure everyone here could think of an example rng i opt for the mistreatment of animals in factory farms sp the imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders and the toleration of rape in our nation 's prisons rng scrimping on donations to life saving charities in the developing world sp the possession of nuclear weapons such as the ban on contraception faith in general rng eh i 'm not holding my breath sp i have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future rng and if our friends you detect a flaw in this argument just remember you 'll be depending on reason to out thank you"
