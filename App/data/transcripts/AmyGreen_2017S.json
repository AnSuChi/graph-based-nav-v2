  "transcript": "one of the video game industry 's biggest nights they announced the nominees for the game for impact an award that 's given to a thought provoking video game with a profound prosocial message or meaning they opened the envelope and they read the title of our video game an award for impact but i found that the the big nights the accomplishments impacting who i am and what i do in two thousand and ten my third son joel was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain tumor doctors sat my husband and i down and let us know that his tumor had returned despite the most aggressive chemotherapy and radiation that they could offer him i cuddled up with my two older sons in bed they were five and three at the time and i never really knew how much they understood i told them about this very brave knight named joel and his adventure fighting a terrible dragon called cancer i was just building up a context that they could understand and hoping that our prayers would be answered and i would never have to tell them that that knight who had fought so bravely was done fighting my children outgrew it joel responded better than anyone expected to palliative treatment and so instead of months we spent years learning how to love our dying child with all of our hearts recognize that shameful feeling of holding back we pushed past that self preservation because joel was worth loving even if that love could crush us and that lesson of intense vulnerability has changed me more than any award ever could and we began developing a video game called that dragon cancer it was the story of hope it was the story of faith and doubt and the realization that a wrestle with doubt is a part of faith maybe the biggest part of it it was a story that began as a miracle and ended as a memorial the transformed into a witness of joel 's life exploring an emotional landscape clicking to discover more of what we as a family felt and experienced it feels a little bit like analyzing interactive poetry because every game mechanic we took that vulnerability that joel taught us and we encoded the game with it players expect their video games to offer them branching narrative so that every decision that they make feels important and can change the outcome of the game we subverted that principle of game design collapsing the choices in on the player so that they discover for themselves that there is nothing that they can do that will change the outcome for joel and they feel that discovery as deeply and desperately as we felt it on nights when we held joel in our arms praying for hours stubbornly holding out hope for a grace that we could not create for ourselves but when you discover that you can 't win what do you value instead i never planned to write video games but these moments that really change our lives they often come as the result of our hardship i left the game designing to my husband but after the night that joel died the passion the possibility of sharing joel 's life through our video game it was something that i couldn 't resist i started writing more i sat in on our team 's design meetings i added more ideas and i helped direct scenes and i discovered that creating a video game but with an entirely new vocabulary all the same elements of imagination and symbolism are there but they 're just partnered with player agency and system responsiveness it 's challenging work i have to think in a totally new way to do it but i love it and i wouldn 't have known that without joel maybe you 're a little surprised by our choice to share our story of terminal cancer through perhaps you 're even thinking like so many people before you cancer is not a game well or transformed a syringe into a rocket because when you have children everything is a game and when your young child experiences something traumatic you work even harder to make sure that their life feels like a game because children naturally explore their worlds through play if you 're listening to me and you 're trying to imagine this family that revolves entirely then we were right to share our story with you because that season of our life was hard unspeakably hard at times but it was also pure hope deep love and joy like i have never experienced since we made a video game that 's hard to play it will never be a blockbuster but when our hearts break they heal a little differently my broken heart has been healing with a new and a deeper compassion a desire to sit with people in their pain to hear their stories and try to help tell them so that they know that they 're seen we smiled and we talked about joel and the impact he had on our life on all of those hard and hopeful nights that we shared with him when he changed our hearts and taught us so much more about life and love and faith and purpose that award will never mean as much to me as even a single photograph they write me emails sometimes they tell me that they miss joel even though they never met him they describe and it makes my burden of grief just a little bit lighter knowing that it 's shared with a 10 year old watching a youtube playthrough or a doctor playing on his airplane with a smartphone or a professor introducing joel to her but that feels tragedy has shifted my heart more than any dream i could ever see come true"
