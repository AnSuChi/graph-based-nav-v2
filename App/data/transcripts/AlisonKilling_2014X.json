  "transcript": "i have an overlooked but potentially lucrative investment opportunity for you the return on burial plots has outperformed the uk property market by a ratio of around three to one and they 're projected to achieve about forty percent growth the biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand now this is a real proposition there are companies out there that really are offering this investment but my interest in it is quite different i 'm an architect and urban designer and for the past year and a half i 've been looking at approaches to death and dying and at how they 've shaped our cities and the buildings within them and it was called so one of our exhibits was an interactive map of london which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death the name of the piece of real estate the and those white shapes that you can see they 're all of the hospitals and hospices and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city in fact the majority are cemeteries we wanted to show that even though death and so about half a million people die in the uk each year and of those around a quarter but the uk like especially in the major cities the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full there 's a custom maybe we can reuse those graves after fifty years or maybe we can bury people like four deep so that four people can be buried in the same plot and we can make more efficient use of the land that way hopefully london will still have space to bury people in the near future but traditionally cemeteries haven 't been taken care of by the local authority traditionally it 's been done by private and religious organizations like churches and mosques and synagogues if you want to go out and start your own cemetery you kind of can and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it and they wanted to develop the land they had a load of ideas they thought about making a caravan park but the council said no and then they wanted to make a fish farm and again the council said no then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery and they calculated that by doing this they could increase the value of their land from about ninety five thousand pounds to over one million pounds and it 's the reason that normally they 're run by the council or by a then i have to apply for planning permission first so if i want to build a a new office building for a client or if i want to extend my home or you know if i have a shop but they 'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on is this thing going to cause pollution or is there going to be a lot of traffic that wants to go to this thing that but what if i 've got a piece of land and i just want to bury a few people like five or six actually i don 't need permission from anyone so actually if you want to go and make your own mini cemetery then you can but i mean like really who if you 're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate then there 's a chance that you 'll have a mausoleum on it and you 'll bury your family there but the really weird thing is that you don 't need to have a piece of land of a certain size before you 're allowed to start burying people on it and so that means that technically this applies to like the back garden of your house in the well there 's a few councils that have guidance on their website which can help you so the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead you 're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio they also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is but that 's pretty much it for formal requirements now they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this but legally speaking there 's almost nothing that they can do about it and just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind about how much those burial plots cost and how much money you might be able to make they also warn that it might cause the value of your it 's more likely that no one will want to buy your house at all after that so what i find fascinating about this is the the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death only about thirty percent of people have ever talked to anyone about their wishes around they think that their death is far off or and there 's people like funeral directors who devote their entire working lives but when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities"
