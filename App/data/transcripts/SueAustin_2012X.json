  "transcript": "wonderful to be here i started using a wheelchair sixteen years ago when an extended illness changed the way i could access the world i started using the wheelchair it was a tremendous new freedom but even though i had this newfound joy and freedom people 's reaction completely changed towards they seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair when i asked people their associations with the wheelchair they i realized i 'd internalized these responses and it had changed who i was on a core level a part of me had become alienated from myself i was seeing myself not from my perspective but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people 's responses to me i knew i needed to make my own stories about this experience new narratives to reclaim my identity i was working to transform these internalized responses to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when i started using a wheelchair by creating unexpected images when i literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people it and therein lay the paradigm shift it showed that an arts practice can remake one 's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar so when i began to dive in two thousand and five i realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure completely different to people 's and the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years i 'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle and show you what an amazing journey it 's taken me on the the the they the the most other things i 've experienced in life i literally their eyes literally light up and they say things like i want if you can do that i can do anything and i 'm thinking it 's because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for or so transcends the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair they have to think in a completely new way for me this means that they 're seeing the value of difference the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new for me the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation in fact i now call the underwater wheelchair portal because it 's literally pushed me through into a new way of being into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness and the other thing is that because nobody 's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing being and knowing now you have this concept in your mind you 're all part of the artwork too"
