  "transcript": "and it would be a fair question to ask point number one each of them represents a unique family of its own we 've lost a whole family that 's a big chunk the second reason is that we killed these things in the case of the thylacine we slaughtered them and this introduces a very important ethical point and i think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up what i think is important is that if it 's clear that we exterminated these species then i think we not only have a moral obligation to see what we can do about it but i think we 've got a moral imperative to try to do something if we can but this was not unlike a normal frog which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs swallowed them into the stomach where it should be having food didn 't digest the eggs and turned its stomach into a uterus in the stomach the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart it when biologists saw this they were agog they thought this is incredible let alone a frog has been known to do this to change one organ in the body into another and you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use it was extinct i called up my professor mike tyler in the university of adelaide he was the last person and i said mike by any chance this was thirty or forty years ago by any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog and he thought about it and he poured through everything in the freezer and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it cryoprotectants to look after it damages or bursts the cell walls well we looked at the tissue under the microscope it actually didn 't let 's give it a go what we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation we took the eggs of a related species a living frog and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg we used ultraviolet radiation to do that and then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that what we 're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work well we had no real reason to expect it would and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these and just last february the last time we did these trials i saw a miracle starting to happen what we found was early stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those we even dna tested some of these cells and the dna of the extinct frog is in those cells so we 're very excited we haven 't announced this publicly before we 're excited we 've got to get past this point we now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues go on and produce watch this space i think we 're going to have this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again thank you we haven 't done it yet but keep the applause ready the second project i want to talk to you about is the thylacine project the thylacine looks a bit to most people like but it 's not related to any of those it 's a marsupial it raised its young in a pouch like a koala or a kangaroo would do and the first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of australia we found and it too was a flesh eater it was a giant weird duck and crocodiles were not behaving at that time either you think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing sitting in a pool of water these crocodiles were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey we had in australia drop crocs they really do exist but what they were dropping on was not only other were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests and they ranged from great big ones to middle sized ones to one that was about the size of a of a chihuahua paris hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little handbag until a drop croc landed on her at any rate it was a fascinating place but unfortunately australia didn 't stay this way climate change has affected the world for a long period of time and gradually the country began to dry out and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline until by five million years ago only one left by four thousand years ago somebodies we don 't know who this was introduced dingoes this is a very archaic kind of a dog into australia and as you can see are very similar in their body form to thylacines that similarity meant they probably competed they were eating the same kinds of foods it 's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival all we know is soon after the dingoes were brought in thylacines were extinct in the australian mainland and after that they only survived in tasmania that guy is going to eat all our sheep and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw by the early 1930s it was a disaster and they were about to hit the wall have a look at it makes me very sad because while it 's a fascinating animal and it 's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction these are photos of the last surviving thylacine benjamin who was in the beaumaris zoo in hobart to add insult to injury having swept this species nearly off the table does it have to stay this way perhaps six months old the guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup and they pickled it in alcohol and i asked my geneticist friends couldn 't we think about going into this pup but then suddenly cloning we went into that pup we also found a lot of human dna every old curator who 'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen put their hand in the jar pulled it out and thylacine back what we didn 't want happening when the information was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine it would 've kept the curator very happy but it wasn 't going to hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers what could we do with this stuff well george church has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented dna we would hope that we 'll be able to get that dna back into a viable form and then much like we 've done with the lazarus project get that stuff into an egg of a host species it has to be a different species what could it be why couldn 't it be a tasmanian devil they 're related distantly to thylacines and then the tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end critics of this project say that 's going to hurt no that tasmanian devil 's not even going to know it gave birth it is shortly going to think it 's got the ugliest tasmanian devil baby in the world so maybe it 'll they took some of this same pickled thylacine dna and they spliced it into a mouse genome but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine dna produced would appear in the mouse baby in other words if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine dna it would be able to be recognized when the baby popped up it was filled with and that tells us if we can get that genome back together get it into a live cell it 's going to produce thylacine stuff is this a risk you 've taken the bits of one animal and you 've mixed them into the cell of a different a frankenstein if we can do this does it have to stay in a laboratory or could we put it back where it belongs could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in tasmania restore that ecosystem has tasmania changed so much that that 's no longer possible i 've been to tasmania i 've even spoken to people like peter carter here who when i spoke to him was ninety years old but in i was looking in his eyes and thinking behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like what they smelled like what they sounded like he led them around on a rope he has personal experiences that i would give my left leg to have in my head we 'd all love to have this sort of thing happen anyway i asked peter by any chance could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines my interest was in whether the environment had changed and tears came into his eyes he looked at the hut we went inside there were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night and he it all was flooding back in memories he said i remember the thylacines going around the hut wondering what was inside and he said and the key question for me was to ask peter has it changed and he said no the southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in one thousand nine hundred and twenty six the grasslands were sweeping away that 's and the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around so could we put it back yes and this is an interesting question sometimes you might be able to put it back but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again and i don 't think so it 's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild we 'd love to think it is but we know it isn 't we need other parallel strategies coming online and this one interests me some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos sanctuaries even at the museums had collar marks on the neck and we know a lot of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets and they say they were wonderful friendly this particular one came in out of the to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep a wild animal and i 'd like to ask the question we need to think about this if it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then and i 'm positive it wouldn 't we need to think about this in today 's world could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them maybe they won 't go extinct and this is such a critical issue for us because if we don 't do that we 're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice as far as i 'm concerned this is why we 're trying to do these kinds of de extinction projects thank you"
