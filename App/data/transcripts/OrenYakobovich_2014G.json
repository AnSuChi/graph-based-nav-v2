  "transcript": "i would like to start with the story of mary a woman from an african village her first memories are of her family fleeing violent riots orchestrated by the ruling political party her brother was murdered by and she was raped more than once just because she belonged to the wrong party mary 's village was called to another intimidation meeting in this meeting there is a man standing in front of them telling them we know who you we 're going to take revenge but for mary this meeting is different she feels different because this time she 's carrying a small hidden camera in her dress a camera that nobody else can see nobody is allowed to film in these you risk your life if you do mary knows that but she also knows that the only way to stop them and to protect herself and her community is to expose their intimidation to make sure they understand somebody is following them mary and her friends were filming for months undercover the of the ruling political party the but more importantly they have been broadcast back to the community the perpetrators saw them they understood somebody is following them they got scared impunity was broken and saved hundreds of lives mary is just one of hundreds of people that my organization had helped to document human rights violations using cameras i wanted to join the israeli army i joined the israeli army just after and i served in quite fast i became an officer and as time passed i started serving in the west bank and i saw these images but eventually i refused to serve in the west bank it was a bit it was not that bad i have to say it was a bit like being in a hotel but with but i also understood we need the palestinians themselves the people that are suffering to be able to tell their own stories not journalists organization an israeli human rights organization called near army bases quite fast we started getting very disturbing images the masked men you will see in the first clips are jewish the palestinians refused the masked men they are approaching the palestinian family the guy in green is palestinian he will be arrested in a second here he regrets he came to this demonstration he 's been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet he is okay but they have to be brought to justice these clips and others like them forced the army and the police to start investigations they 've been shown in israel of course and the israeli public was exposed to them also the success of this project got me thinking how i can and people are able to tell their story still today with all the technology we have less than half of and more than three billion people i 'm repeating the number three billion people are consuming news that is censored by those in power more or less around the same time i 'm approached by a great guy named uri and an activist we understood we were thinking along the and there was a lack of reporting there were four things that i where violations are happening far from the public eye we need to partner with them and we need to understand which images are not making it out there and help them to document them the second thing i learned where i used to work before in the west bank one can take a camera out most likely not going to get shot but in places we wanted to work just try to pull a phone out and you 're dead literally dead unfortunately i can 't show you the hidden cameras we 're using today for obvious reasons today we it 's a camera that nobody can see that blends into the environment into the surroundings now being secure starts way before the activist is turning the camera on building a backup plan if something goes wrong and making sure we have everything in place before our operations start the third thing i but if you can 't verify it it 's worth nothing we 've seen images that are staged or brought from a different conflict we use a variety of ways to make sure we can verify the information and we can trust the material it starts with vetting the partners understanding who they are and working with them very intensively how do you film a location you film road signs you film watches you film newspapers looking at maps double checking the information and looking also at the metadata the fourth and the most important thing i learned is how you use images to create a positive change we work with them both to understand the situation on the ground and which images are missing to describe it more than often the most effective way to create a social change is to work within the community i want to give you one example women in her community have been harassed constantly on their way to school and on their way to work they are trying to change the behavior of the community from inside in the next clip journey to work her voice is superimposed on images that she filmed herself using hidden cameras the men inside the way they look at me touch my body rub against me grab me and now as i sit in my seat i only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day my dreams my children at school but instead i worry about the moment when i used to carry a big gun now i am carrying this this is a much more powerful and much much more effective weapon but we have to use its power wisely by putting the right images in the right hands the right time we can truly create an impact"
