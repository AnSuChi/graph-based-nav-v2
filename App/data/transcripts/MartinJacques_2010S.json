if you look at the it 's projected that the chinese economy will be twice the size of the american economy and the indian economy will be almost the same size as the american economy and i was looking at the latest projection by bnp paribas for when china will have a larger economy than the united states goldman sachs projected two thousand and twenty seven the projection is two thousand and twenty that 's just a decade decade away china is going to change the world in two fundamental respects first of all it 's a huge developing country with a population of one point three billion people which has been growing for over thirty years at around ten percent a year and within a decade it will have the largest economy in the world never before in the modern era the dominant country in the world which i think is what china will become will be not from the west and from very very different civilizational roots now i know it 's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize they also westernize this is an illusion it 's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition markets and technology it is not it is also shaped equally by history and culture it will remain in very fundamental respects very different and the problem we have in the west at the moment by and large is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in western terms now i want to offer you three building blocks the first is this that china but everyone who knows anything about china knows it 's a lot older than this or immediately afterward the han dynasty still two thousand years ago and you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as eastern china which is where the vast majority of chinese lived then and live now now what is extraordinary about this is what gives china its sense of being china what gives but from the period if you like of social relationships like guanxi confucian values and so on these are all things that come from the period of the unlike the western states and most countries in the world is shaped by its sense of civilization its existence as and there 's one other thing to add to this and that is this of course we know china 's big huge demographically and geographically with a population of one point three billion people what we often aren 't really aware of is the fact that china is extremely diverse and very pluralistic and in many ways very decentralized you can 't run a place on this scale simply from beijing even though we think it 's never been the case so this is china rather than i think it has all sorts of profound implications i 'll give you two quick ones the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity is the maintenance of chinese civilization over very painfully holding this huge which is hong kong do you remember the handover of hong kong by britain to china in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven you may remember what the chinese constitutional proposition was one country two systems and i 'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the west believed them window dressing when china gets its hands on hong kong that won 't be the case thirteen years on the political and legal system in hong kong is as different now as it was in we were wrong why were we wrong we were wrong but you can 't run a country like on the basis of one civilization one system it doesn 't work so actually the response of many systems let me offer you another building block to try and understand china maybe not sort of a comfortable one the chinese have a very very different conception of race to most other countries do you know of the one point three billion chinese over ninety percent of them think they belong to the same race most populous countries india the united states indonesia brazil all of them are multiracial the chinese don 't feel like that china is only so the question is assimilation and so on led to the process by which over time this notion the han identity has been the cement which has the great disadvantage of it is that the han have a very weak conception of cultural difference they really believe in their and they are disrespectful of those who are not hence their attitude for example to the uyghurs and to the tibetans now the relationship between the state and society in china is very different from that now we in the west overwhelmingly seem to think in these days at least that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy the problem with this proposition is that the chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the chinese reason for this is because because the state in china is given a very special it enjoys a very special significance the embodiment and the guardian of chinese civilization of the this is as close as china gets to a kind of spiritual and the second reason whereas in europe and north america the state 's power is continuously against merchants and so on the power of the chinese state has not been challenged it 's had no serious rivals so you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in china is very different from our experience in western history the result way is that the chinese have a very different view of the state certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained the chinese don 't see the chinese view the state the patriarch this is the chinese view of the state it 's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the west and i would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing which is different from anything we 've had to think about in the past know that that china believes in the market and the state i mean adam smith already writing in the late 18th century said the chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in but this is combined with an extremely strong it 's leading firms many of them are still depend in many ways on state patronage targets for the economy and so on are set by the moreover but this is another this is the grand canal which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century b c and was finally completed a d it went for one thousand one hundred and fourteen miles linking beijing with hangzhou and shanghai which is something like the three gorges dam and many other so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society and yet we still insist by and large in thinking that we can understand china using western concepts this is i have to say that i think attitude towards china is that of a kind of little westerner mentality and therefore it 's ignorant we refuse to really address the issue of difference you know there 's a very and paul cohen argues that the west thinks of itself it 's the most because for two hundred years the west has been so dominant in the world that it 's not really needed to understand other cultures whereas those cultures virtually the rest of the world in and therefore they are as a result more cosmopolitan in many ways now the largest economic region in the world are far more knowledgeable about the west than the west is about east asia now this point is very germane i 'm afraid the goldman sachs chart what is happening is that very rapidly in historical terms the world is being driven but by the developing world we 've seen this in terms of the g20 usurping very rapidly the position of the g7 or the g8 and there are two consequences of this the west is rapidly losing its influence in the world there was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago copenhagen climate change conference and the second implication is that the world will inevitably as a consequence become increasingly unfamiliar to us because it 'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with or conversant with and at last i 'm afraid take europe america is slightly different but europeans by and large i have to say are ignorant are unaware some people an english friend in china and he said the continent is sleepwalking into oblivion but there 's another problem which goes along with this this that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world and that is a sort of loss this is a railway station the likes of which you 've never seen before it doesn 't even look like a railway station this is the new but it 's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing here you have a megabus and the cars travel now this is the way things are going to move because china has a very specific problem which is different from europe and different from the united states so this is a solution to a situation where china 's going to have so how would i like to finish well what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us i think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it but i want to argue for two hundred years the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population that 's what europe and north america represented the arrival of countries like china and india between them thirty eight percent of the world 's population and others like indonesia and brazil and so on represent the most important single act of democratization in the last two hundred years civilizations and cultures which had been ignored which had no voice which were not listened to which were not known about will have a different sort of representation in this world as humanists we must welcome surely and we will have to learn about these civilizations this big ship here was the one sailed in by zheng he the little boat in front of it was the one in which eighty years later christopher columbus crossed the atlantic or
