  "transcript": "military commander i 'm really honored i see very special audience you are the reason why i said yes to the invitation to come here today i see people who want to make a contribution i see people who want to make a by doing groundbreaking scientific work by creating impressive works of art by writing critical articles and you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating some chose the microscope others chose dancing others work i made a different choice ladies and gentlemen i share the goals of the speakers you heard before i did not choose to take up i chose this being so close to this gun it may even feel scary a real gun let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness you could even hear it let us the fact that probably most of you it means it means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets guns are not a part of our lives it is a different story in many they are oppressed they are intimidated by warlords by terrorists by criminals weapons can do a lot of harm they are the cause of much distress why then am i standing before you with this weapon why did i choose the gun as my instrument today i want to tell you why today i want to tell you why i chose the gun to create a better and i want to tell you how this gun can help my story starts in the city of nijmegen the city where i was born but when he had finished work in the bakery he told me this story i 'm going to share with you now the story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier in the dutch armed forces the nazis invaded the netherlands their grim plans were evident diplomacy had failed to stop the germans only brute force it was our last resort my father was there to provide it as the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt he never missed at this decisive moment in dutch history my father was positioned on the bank of the river waal near the city of nijmegen his country nothing happened he fired again no german soldier fell to the ground my father hitler 's troops marched on my father could do about it he could have done something but with an old gun not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark so this story stayed with me then in high school i was gripped by the stories of the allied soldiers soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn 't know they liberated my birth town it was then that i decided i would take up the gun out of respect and gratitude from the awareness that sometimes only the gun and that is why i took up the gun but to stop those who would do evil to protect the vulnerable to defend democratic values to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place i do not stand here today and once it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about i stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability the gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world now this may sound contradictory to you but not only have i seen with my own eyes during my deployments in lebanon sarajevo and as the netherlands ' chief of defence this is also supported by cold hard statistics violence has declined dramatically despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news the murder rate in europe has dropped by a factor of thirty and occurrences of civil war and repression have declined statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era why well we were talking about the human mind this morning did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge for violent rituals for pure rage or is there something else harvard professor steven pinker and many other thinkers before him concludes that one of the the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction on a large scale of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence legitimized by a democratically elected government legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system in other words a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control such a state monopoly on violence first of all serves as a reassurance the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war now and trade is another important incentive against violence with trade there 's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties and when there is mutual gain both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war and that is why violence has decreased ladies and gentlemen is the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces the armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence we do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to reducing the statistics of war conflict it is this participation in peacekeeping missions that has led to the resolution of many civil wars my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace and this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous failed states have no legitimized democratically controlled use of force failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability that is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict that is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state is such an important aspect of our foreign missions that is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in afghanistan and that is why and in the netherlands we are very unique in that dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces looking at this gun we are confronted with the ugly side of the development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression we will have to make ideals and human failure i stand for my father i stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives for a less i stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss when she was hit i hope we all agree it takes good equipment and well trained dedicated soldiers i hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain instead of the bad gun my father was given i hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there when they come home and when they are injured and need our care they put their lives on the line for us for you and we cannot let them down i hope you will respect my soldiers this soldier because she makes an active contribution"
