  "transcript": "and i was having a wonderful time listening to the amazing isabel wilkerson 's the warmth of other suns it documents six million black folks fleeing the south from nine hundred and fifteen to one thousand nine hundred and seventy looking for a respite from all the brutality and trying to get to a better opportunity up north and it was filled with stories of the resilience and the brilliance of african americans and it was also really hard to hear all the stories of the horrors and the humility and all the humiliations it was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings and the lynchings of black men i 'm going to turn on the radio i turned it on and there it was ferguson shot by a white police officer laid on the ground dead blood running for four hours while his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror and i thought here it is again it could have been oscar grant it could have been trayvon martin this brutality is really something that 's part of our national psyche it 's part of our you know that part of us that still i mean know we 're not shooting people down in the street but i 'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents i believe that we can stop these types of incidents these fergusons from happening by looking within so i have a call to action for you three things that i 'm hoping will not only protect them but will open the world so that they can thrive can you imagine that can giving them that kind of openness that kind of grace we give to people we love we gotta get out of denial you know i do a lot of diversity work and people will come up to me at the beginning of have a biased bone in our body and i 'm like really because i do this work every day and i see all my biases i mean so excited so thrilled and i was like i hope she can drive i know right but it 's not even like i knew that was a bias until i was coming back on the other leg and there 's always a guy driving and it 's often turbulent and bumpy and i 've never questioned the confidence of the male driver the if you ask me explicitly i would say female pilot awesome i lean on a bias that i didn 't even know that i had you know fast moving planes in the sky i want a guy that 's my default men are my default who do you trust who are you afraid of who do you implicitly feel connected to who do you run away from i 'm going to tell you what we have learned the implicit association test which measures unconscious bias you can go online and take it five million people have turns out we like white people we prefer white what do i mean by that when people are shown images of black men and white men we are more quickly able to associate that picture with a positive word that white person with a positive word than we are when we are trying to it is easier for us to connect black with negative than it is white with negative seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white you see we were all outside when the contamination came down one of the things that you probably are thinking about and you 're probably like you know what i 'm just going to double down on my color blindness recommit to that i 'm going to suggest to you no we 've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference trying to not see color the problem was never that we saw that 's keeping them from thriving and sometimes it 's causing them an early death so in fact what the scientists are telling us is no way don in fact what they 're suggesting is stare at awesome black people at them directly in their faces and memorize them because when we look at awesome folks who are black it helps to dissociate the association that happens automatically in our brain why do you think i 'm showing i 'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are i 'm trying to remind you that young black men grow up to be amazing human beings who have changed our lives and so here 's the thing the other possibility in science and it 's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions but one thing we know is that if you take a white person who is odious and stick it up next to a person of color a black person who is fabulous then that sometimes actually causes right disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old it 's not the hardest thing to do but it 's also one of these things where you have to be conscious and intentional about it you know i was in a wall street and we were outside it was late at night and we were sort of wondering where we were going we were lost and i saw this person across the street guy i was going toward him without even thinking about it and she was like oh that 's interesting he was a black guy i think so she was different reaction and she said i feel so bad i 'm a diversity consultant i did the black guy thing i 'm a woman of color we really need to relax about this i mean you 've got to realize i go way back with black my black guy thing is so wide and so deep that i can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is and he was my black guy he said yes ladies i know where you 're going i 'll take you there you know biases are the stories we make up about people before we know who they actually are but how are we going to know who they are and i 'm not asking you to take any crazy risks i 'm saying expand your social and professional circles who 's in your circle who 's missing how many authentic relationships or any other major difference from who you are and how you roll so to speak and you 're nice you say hi i 'm saying go deeper closer further and build the kinds of relationships the kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person and to really go against the stereotypes i know some of you are out there i know because i have some white friends in particular that will say have no idea how awkward i am like i don 't think this is going to work for me i mean you just have to do it and young black men what i 'm saying is if someone comes your way genuinely and authentically take the invitation not everyone is out to get you go looking for those people who can see your humanity you know it 's the empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you something really powerful and beautiful happens you start to realize that they are you that they are part of you because that is especially young black men can thrive so this last thing is going to be harder and i know it but i 'm just going to put it out there anyway when we see something we have to have the courage to say something even to the people we love you know it 's holidays and it 's going to be a time when we 're sitting around the table and having a good time many of us anyways will be in holidays and you start to say things like grandma 's uncle joe is racist and you know we and we need to be able to say something because you know who else is at the table the children are at the table and we wonder why these biases don 't die and move from generation to because we 're not saying anything we 've got to be willing to say grandma we don 't call people that anymore no one deserves that and we 've got to be willing to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism when black parents don 't have the luxury to do so especially those who have young black sons we 've got to take our lovely darlings our future and we 've got to tell them we have an amazing country with incredible ideals we have worked incredibly hard and we have made some progress but we are not we still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations and it is making for despair we still struggle you have to tell them with seeing both the color and you expect them to be part of the forces of change in this society that will stand against injustice and is willing above all other things to make a society where young black men can be seen for all of who they are those who are the most amazing statesmen that have ever lived people who are powerful preachers they are incredible scientists and artists and writers they are dynamic comedians they are caring sons thank you"
