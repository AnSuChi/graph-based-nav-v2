  "transcript": "both from each other and at times from themselves back in january two thousand and nine we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform january two thousand and fourteen more than five hundred million we were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes that 's a vast majority of activity on twitter puts no one in harm 's way there 's no risk involved my job is to root out and prevent activity that might sounds straightforward right you might even think it 'd be easy given that i just said the vast majority of activity on twitter puts no one in harm 's way why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities given the scale that twitter is at a one in a million chance happens five hundred times a day it edge cases those rare situations that are unlikely to occur are more like norms ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone there 's no threat involved maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like australia nine nine nine percent that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly one hundred and fifty thousand per month the sheer scale of what we 're dealing with makes for a challenge you know what else makes my role particularly challenging people do weird and i have to figure out what they 're doing why and whether or not there 's risk involved often without much in terms of context or background i 'm going to show you some examples that i 've run into during my time at twitter these are all real examples of situations that at first seemed cut and dried but the truth of the matter was something altogether different the details if you saw a tweet that only said this you might think to yourself that looks like abuse after all why would you want to receive the message yo bitch i try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes i knew that yo bitch was also often a common greeting between friends as well as being a popular breaking bad reference it turns out it is also used on twitter when people are role playing and in fact in that case it 's not only not abusive it 's technically just an accurate greeting sending the exact same message to thousands people while this is a mockup i put together using my account we see accounts doing this all the time turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the international space station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it you 're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it 's spam somebody trying to steal another person 's account information by directing them to another website well this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video we don 't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it given the sorts of challenges i 'm up it 's crucial that i not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected so what do i do i pause and i think how could all of this go horribly wrong i visualize there 's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that like when you 're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement but you still have to do it particularly if you 're marrying five hundred million tweets per day what do i mean by visualize catastrophe i try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death and what to do to prevent that we wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their there 's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet my job isn 't to think of those it 's to think of what could go wrong how could this picture here 's one possibility there 's geodata there 's a lot of additional information saved along in that image in fact this image also contains the equivalent of this this sure it 's not likely that someone 's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture i took of my cat but i start by assuming the worst will happen that 's why when we launched photos on twitter we made the decision to strip that if i start by assuming the worst and work given that i spend my days it wouldn 't be surprising if my worldview was gloomy it 's not the vast majority of interactions i see and i see a lot believe me are positive people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other it 's just because for us a one in a million chance is pretty good odds thank you"
