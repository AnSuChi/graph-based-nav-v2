  "transcript": "how many people here have heard of pms everybody right everyone knows that women go a little crazy right before they get their period that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster of irrationality and there 's a general assumption that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions and that the great majority of women are affected by this well if you examine newspaper or magazine articles you 'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets pms in an article in the magazine redbook titled you pms free readers were informed that between eighty to ninety percent of women suffer from pms muscle magazine warned its readers asking its female readers do you turn into a witch every month from all these articles you would think there must be a mountain of research verifying the widespread nature of pms however after five decades of research there 's no strong consensus on the definition the cause the treatment or even the existence of pms as most commonly defined by psychologists pms involves negative behavioral cognitive and physical symptoms from the time of ovulation to menstruation but here 's where it gets tricky over one hundred and fifty different symptoms have been used to diagnose pms and here are just a few of those now i want to be clear here i 'm not saying women don 't get some of these symptoms what i 'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms doesn 't amount to a mental disorder and when psychologists come up with a that 's so vaguely defined the label eventually becomes meaningless my dog could have pms some researchers said you had to have five symptoms some said three other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful if they were highly disturbing to you but others said minor symptoms were just as important the weaknesses in the methods of research on pms have been considerable which is known to inflate reporting of pms which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms for at least two months in a row many studies also exclusively focused on white we know there 's a strong cultural component to the belief in pms because it 's nearly unheard of outside of western nations third many studies failed to use control groups if we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have pms we need to be able to compare them to women who don 't have pms and finally many different types of questionnaires were used to diagnose pms focusing on different symptoms symptom duration and severity to do reliable research on any condition scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition so they 're all talking about the same thing this has not been the case according to these new dsm guidelines in most menstrual cycles in the last year at least five of eleven possible symptoms must appear in the week before menstruation starts the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended one of these symptoms must come from this list of four anxiety or depression the other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appetite the dsm also required now that the symptoms should be associated with clinically significant distress there should be some kind of disturbance in work or school or social relationships so scientifically speaking this we now have a limited number of symptoms and a high impact on functioning that 's required and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific three to three to eight percent and this is the information the scientific community has had since the in two thousand and two why do these myths persist well certainly the onslaught of messages that women research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets pms the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it let me tell you what i mean by erroneously another reason for the persistence of the pms myth has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role feminist psychologists like joan chrisler have suggested that taking on the label of pms allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered the near universal definition of a good woman is one who is happy loving caring for others and taking great satisfaction from that role well pms has become a permission slip without losing the title of good woman we know that the variables in a woman 's environment are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones but when she attributes anger to hormones she 's absolved of responsibility or criticism oh that 's not who she is it 's out of her control and while this can be a useful tool it serves to invalidate women 's emotions when people respond to a woman 's anger with the thought oh 's just that time of the month her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited well i can tell you that treating pms has become a profitable thriving industry amazon com currently offers over one thousand nine hundred books on pms treatment a quick google search will bring up a cornucopia of clinics workshops and seminars reputable internet sources of medical information like webmd or the mayo clinic list pms as a known disorder it 's not a known disorder but they list it interestingly though both websites say that the success of medication in treating pms symptoms vary from woman to woman well that doesn 't make sense this has not been the case with these treatments and fda regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective a large portion of the target population should see clinically significant improvement the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that pms is a common mental disorder and is treatable is quite substantial when women are prescribed drugs like anti depressants or hormones medical protocol requires that they have physician follow up every three months that 's a lot of doctor visits visits child bearing lives even though they only contain a diuretic a pain reliever and caffeine but i don 't think reducing tension is one of them since two thousand and two midol has marketed a teen midol to adolescents they are aiming at young girls early but wait there 's something you can do about it take midol and you will be a human being again in two thousand and thirteen midol took in forty eight million dollars in sales revenue first it contributes to the medicalization of women 's reproductive health and this has come at many costs including excessive cesarean deliveries hysterectomies second the pms myth also contributes to the stereotype when the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster that turns women into angry beasts it becomes easy to question the competence of all women and when we think about who makes for a good ceo or senator steadiness competence come to mind that sounds more like a man than a woman and the pms myth contributes to that psychologists know that the moods of men and women are more similar than different one study followed men and women for four to six months and finally the pms myth keeps women from dealing with the actual issues causing them emotional upset individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty are all strongly related to daily mood sweeping emotions under the rug of pms keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them so the good news about pms is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle the great majority don 't get a mental disorder they go to work or school take care of their families and function at a normal level we know the emotions and moods of men and women are more similar than different so let 's walk away from the tired old pms myth of women as witches and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning the great majority of women live every day thank you"
