  "transcript": "is the music i 've chosen for my funeral and you feel anything but and having been given the opportunity to understand something about why i was here in the first place before not being here can robert full and frans lanting and others the beauty of the things that they showed the only slight jarring note was when jeffrey katzenberg said of the mustang the most splendid creatures that god put on this earth but in this country at the moment you can 't be too careful the theory of design darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection in professional circles it arouses so much hostility the war is so worrying at present with court cases coming up in one state after another that i felt i had to say something about it which you won 't find in the bookstore outside contemporary court cases often concern an allegedly new version of creationism called intelligent it 's just creationism under another name rechristened i choose the word advisedly for tactical political reasons the arguments of so called id theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again since darwin down to the present day there is an effective evolution lobby coordinating the fight on behalf of science and i try to do all i can to help them they see us as rocking the boat and fall back on the popular phobia teach your children evolution in biology class and they 'll soon move on to drugs grand larceny and sexual educated theologians from the pope down are firm in their support finding darwin 's god by kenneth miller is one of the most effective attacks on intelligent design that i know and it 's all the more effective because it 's written by a devout christian people like kenneth miller could be called a godsend to the evolution lobby because they expose the lie that evolutionism is as a matter of fact tantamount to atheism people like me on the other hand rock the boat but here i want to say something nice about creationists it 's not a thing i often do so listen carefully i think they 're right about one thing i think they 're right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion i believe a true understanding of darwinism and i want to reassure you that that 's not what i 'm going to do in an audience as sophisticated as this one that would be preaching to the choir no what i want to urge upon you instead what i want to urge upon you is militant atheism but that 's putting it too negatively i would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things statistical improbability in the direction of good design complexity is another word for this the standard creationist argument there is only one they 're all reduced to this one takes off from a statistical improbability living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance therefore they must have had a designer this argument of course shoots itself in the foot any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself and that 's before we even start on the other things he 's expected to do like forgive sins bless marriages listen to prayers favor our side in a war disapprove of our sex lives and so on complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to and you can 't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex thereby simply compounding the problem darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem essentially it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual precisely because it is so elegant so parsimonious so powerful the god theory is not just a bad theory it turns out to be in principle incapable so returning to tactics and the evolution lobby i want to argue that rocking the boat may be just the right thing to do my approach to attacking creationism is unlike the evolution lobby my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole certainly should have been invited richard saul wurman i thought he must have been he begins this speech which was tape recorded in cambridge shortly before he died he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof and then he goes on i quote religion doesn 't seem to work like that it has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call ' sacred ' or ' holy ' what it means is here is an idea or a notion that you 're not allowed to say anything bad about you 're just not why not because you 're not but to have an opinion about how the universe began about who created the universe no that 's holy so we 're used to not challenging religious ideas 's very interesting how much of a furor richard creates when he does it he meant me not that one because you 're not allowed to say these things yet when you look at it rationally there 's no reason why those ideas shouldn 't be as open to debate as any other except that we 've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn 't be and that 's the end of the quote from douglas in my view not only is science corrosive to religion religion is corrosive it teaches people to be satisfied with trivial supernatural and blinds them revelation instead of always insisting on evidence magnificent picture from his book last chance to see now there 's a typical scientific journal the quarterly review of biology and i 'm going to put together as guest editor a special issue on the question did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs and the first paper the president of the royal society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs it has been privately revealed to professor huxtane that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and unquestioning faith that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs professor hawkins has promulgated an official dogma binding on all loyal hawkinsians that an asteroid a reporter asked george bush sr whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists mr bush 's reply has become infamous this is one nation under god bush 's bigotry was not an isolated mistake blurted out in the heat of the moment and later retracted he stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal he really meant it more to the point he knew it posed no threat to his election democrats as well as republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected both parties invoke one nation under god what would thomas jefferson have said you can 't help making the comparison in practice what is an atheist an atheist is just somebody who feels about yahweh been said before we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in some of us just go one god further and however we define it 's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic unelectable and that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of but actually how do but what would you think was the second largest group convincingly outnumbering jews is the one described as or secular you can 't help wondering why vote seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of for example the jewish lobby seems to owe its very existence to the american jewish vote while at the same time consigning the to political oblivion if properly mobilized is nine times as numerous as the jewish vote why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle is there any correlation positive or negative between intelligence and tendency to be religious [ them folks misunderestimated me ] the survey that i quoted which is mensa as you know is an international organization for people with very high belief and one 's intelligence or educational level all but four found an inverse connection the less one is likely to be religious well i haven 't seen the original forty two studies and i can 't comment on and i know that there are if i could put a little plug here there are people in this audience easily capable of financing but let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group namely top scientists belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent about twenty percent are agnostic the rest could fairly be called atheists similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality among biological scientists the figure is even lower five point five percent but i 'd be surprised if they were different so we 've reached a truly remarkable situation a grotesque mismatch between the american intelligentsia and the american electorate a philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe which is held by the vast majority of top american scientists and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally is so abhorrent to the american electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public if i 'm right this means that high office in the greatest country in the world is barred to the very people best qualified to hold it the intelligentsia unless they are prepared to lie about their beliefs to put it bluntly american political opportunities are heavily loaded against those who are simultaneously intelligent and honest i 'm not a citizen of this country so i hope it won 't be thought unbecoming if i suggest that something needs to be done and i we need a although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of people against their will they 'll demonstrate that atheists are often the kinds of people who could serve as decent role models for the kinds of people who are sitting in this room there should be a snowball effect a positive feedback such that the more names we we have the more we get there could be non linearities threshold effects when a critical i suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves so what other words might be used to smooth the path oil the sugar the pill darwin himself preferred agnostic and not only out of loyalty to his friend huxley who coined the term ' would be the most correct description of my state of mind he even became uncharacteristically tetchy with edward aveling militant atheist who failed to persuade darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism incidentally giving rise to a fascinating myth that karl marx tried to dedicate das kapital to darwin which he didn 't it was actually edward aveling and when both darwin and marx were dead marx 's papers became muddled up thank you very much but i don 't want you to dedicate your book to me was mistakenly and that that gave rise to this whole myth which you 've probably heard it 's a sort of urban myth that marx tried to dedicate but why should you be so aggressive but that ordinary people were not quote ripe for it it 's not recorded whether aveling told darwin to come down off his high horse laughter but in any case that was more than one hundred years ago you 'd think we might have grown up since then describes himself as a agnostic he won 't call himself an atheist because it 's in principle impossible to prove a negative but agnostic on its own might suggest that god 's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood but hence the phrase tooth fairy agnostic bertrand russell made the same point using a hypothetical teapot in orbit about mars but that doesn 't mean you treat the if you want to believe one particular one of them unicorns or tooth fairies or teapots or yahweh the onus is on you to say why the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not we who are atheists but we don 't bother to say so and this is why my friend uses nonetheless if we want to attract deep down atheists to come out publicly we 're going to have find something better to stick on our banner than this has the advantage of a worldwide network of well organized associations and journals and things already in place my problem with it is only its apparent anthropocentrism one of the things we 've learned from darwin is that the human species is only one among millions of cousins some close some distant and but that also has problems of confusion because darwin would have thought naturalist naturalist means of course as opposed to supernaturalist and it is used sometimes darwin would have been confused by the and i suppose there might be others who would confuse it with nudism such people which last year attacked a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile and it could therefore easily be embraced by when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein use the word god they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep mysterious part of physics which we don 't yet understand hysterical carrying frissons of hysterical phobia critical mass may be harder if we did achieve it with that dread word atheist itself the political impact would be even greater now and this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting more poetic more filled with sheer wonder poverty stricken arsenals of the religious imagination as carl sagan another recently dead hero put it how is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded ' this is better than we thought the universe is much bigger than our prophet said grander more subtle more elegant and i want him to stay that way ' a religion old or new that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths and i would therefore expect about ten percent of you to be religious many of you probably subscribe to our polite cultural belief but i also suspect that a fair number of those secretly despise religion as much as i do if you 're one of them i 'm asking you to stop being polite come out and say so give some thought to ways in which you might make a difference the religious lobby in this country is massively financed by foundations to say nothing of all the tax benefits by foundations such as the templeton foundation and the discovery institute we need an to step forward instead of only as well as richard dawkins ' books i 'd do it myself people are always going on let 's all stop being so damned respectful thank you very much"
