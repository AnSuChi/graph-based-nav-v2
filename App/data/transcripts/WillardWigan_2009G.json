  "transcript": "what i wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things we all seem to think that and we use the word nothing nothing doesn when i was a child that i should always respect the little things what made me do this work i shall go into my my story this all started when i was age five i will admit this academically i couldn 't express myself so i was so i thought i need to retreat so when my mother used to take me to school she thought i was at school and i used to do a u turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden now the one time i was in the shed and my mother suspected something thinking i was at school my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry so you 'd just see her feet and then she said grabbed me like that because my mother was quite big and she lifted me up and she says how come you 're not at school i told her i couldn 't face it because the the teacher was treating me ridiculing me and using me as an example of failure so i because i expected one of these but i didn 't get it so i 'm i noticed there was some ants running around and i went into this little fantasy world and i thought these ants are they looking for the queen ant or do they need somewhere to live so i thought perhaps if i made these ants some well it looked like a little shanty shed when i 'd finished but i thought perhaps the ant won 't know it 'll probably move in and then i sat down and all the ants came along and all i could hear was is this for us and they moved in and decided not to pay me any rent so i realized that there was more to life than just now i shall show you something here that 's a pinhead me to do this was a gentleman called peter huf and he says to me willard can you put my house on a pinhead so i say how are you going to fit in there and then he said to me i don 't believe you can do it can you really do it and i says try me and then he said but i don 't believe that you can do this so i said and i crushed up crushed it up and underneath and the actual roof is made up of a fiber which i found in my sister 's old teddy bear so i got the teddy bear and i said do you mind if i pull out one of your fibers it was flat so i decided to slice these up with the tool that i make and then i work between my heartbeat move and at the same time i have to watch i don 't inhale my own work at the same time because that has happened to me i found these little so i 'm thinking how can i do this so what i did i got an oilstone broke the edge of an oilstone off and i built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn 't crush the and then i started rubbing very very gently and it went like huf isn 't going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another into the atmosphere somewhere so to cut the story short i decided that i had to go back and do it so i found some more and i decided to sort of construct and making sure everything is leveled because it 's such a a small which i held and the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed i used a money spider 's web to actually attach certain things things which sent me insane but i managed to do it and i came back the next day i noticed that the house was occupied have we ever heard of a dust mite darren dust mite and his family moved in so i didn 't think he was going to throw bart off i think he was just warning him actually but this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt what i did i plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope i used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end what i did is the same process where i just kind of hold my breath and just work away very very slowly manipulating the plastic cutting it because it behaves different whenever you work on that level things behave different because it 's on this molecular level things change and they act different and sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air and but i had to make a little barrier going around it out of cellophane to stop and i 'm trying to remove it and the static is interfering with everything so there is sweat dripping off my head because i have to carve homer simpson like and after i 've cut out the shape then i have to make sure that there is room for bart 's neck and after i 've actually sculpted them i experimented with a i found a dead fly and i plucked the hair off the fly 's head decided to make a paintbrush even though they get on our nerves i would never kill an insect because all creatures great and small there is a hymn that says that so what i decided to do is to pluck and i looked at it and whilst i 'm painting i have to be very careful because the paint starts to to turn into little blobs and it starts to so i have to be very quick if i 'm not it will end up looking not like what it 's supposed to look like it could end up looking like humpty dumpty so i have to be very very careful six to seven weeks rough estimate sometimes five six to seven weeks you can 't always anticipate that 's charlton heston brought down to size i enjoyed your film that 's why as you can see there 's an aphid fly there that 's just to show the scale and the actual size i would say it probably measures a so say if you cut a period stop in half a full stop that 's about the size of the whole thing it 's made the chariot is made of gold and charlton heston is made of and what i normally do is walk ' round a room to find one and there was a lady standing by the bus stop and she saw me walking around like this and and then i went i had a 24 karat gold ring and i cut off a little flake of gold and i bent it ' round and made it into the chariot because i had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action i did this one a gentleman seen it and said to me there 's no way you can do this you must have used some kind of machine there 's no way a man can do that it must be a machine so i says ok then if you say it 's a machine i would to put the torch on the top that one is more or less the same type of process the bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of you know the beginning of people and that 's the first thing they saw so i wanted to have that little image and this is it and we all know that is the hulk i wanted to create movement so i broke the needle and made a needle look like the hulk 's broken it it 's as you can see he 's looking at the moment he 's got a little grimace on his face and that ship there it was sending me insane because i couldn 't get the web to move off and and the whole thing is sort of it 's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right it 's something i wanted to do just to show how i could get the symmetrical shape the actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing and that was done with a particle from but the best things come in small packages"
