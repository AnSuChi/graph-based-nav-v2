  "transcript": "one summer afternoon in two thousand and thirteen dc police detained questioned and searched a man who appeared suspicious and potentially dangerous i know it 's very frightening try to remain calm he told me to stop take my backpack off and put my hands on the police car parked next to us about a dozen officers then gathered near us and as all this was happening as i was on the police car trying to ignore the shaking in my legs trying to think clearly about what i should do something stuck out to me as odd when i look at myself middle eastern male with a backpack i never expected to be and the detention dragged on like this they sent dogs trained to smell explosives to sweep the area i 'd been in they called the federal government to see if i was on any watch lists they sent a couple of i wouldn 't consent to a search of my car i think we 're all normalized from a young age to the idea of police officers and arrests and so it 's easy to forget how demeaning and coercive a thing it is to seize control over another person 's body i know it sounds like the point of my story is how badly treated i was because of my race and yes i don 't think i would 've been detained if i were white but actually what i have in mind today is something else what i have in mind is how much worse things might 've been if i weren 't affluent things might 've ended differently and in fact in our system i think it 's better to be an affluent person suspected of trying to blow up a police station than it is to be a poor person who 's suspected of much much less than let me start by raise your hand i and when i had to pay it it felt annoying and it felt bad but i paid it and i moved on i 'm guessing most of you have paid your tickets you couldn 't afford the amount on the ticket and your family doesn 't have the money either what happens then well but that 's what local governments across the country are doing to people who are poor and so many of our lawsuits at equal justice under law and i know when i say ferguson many of you will think of police violence but today i want to talk about a different aspect of the relationship between their police force and their citizens per person per year mostly for unpaid debt to the courts when i imagine what that would feel like if every time i left my house there was a chance a police i feel a little sick i 've met many of the people in ferguson who have experienced this and i 've heard some of their stories in ferguson 's jail in each small cell there 's a bunk bed and a toilet one with nowhere to go except right next to the filthy toilet which was never cleaned in fact the whole cell was never cleaned so the floor and the walls were lined with blood and mucus woman about medical attention she laughed and she said oh no no the only attention you get from the guards in there is sexual so they 'd take the debtors to this place and they 'd say we 're not letting you leave until you make a payment on your debt and if you could if you could call a family member who could somehow come up with some money then maybe you were out but if it wasn 't you 'd stay there for days or weeks and every day the guards would come down to the cells and haggle with the debtors about the price of release that day you 'd stay until at some point the jail would be booked to capacity and they 'd want to book someone new in and at that point they 'd think ok it 's unlikely this person can come up with the money it 's more likely this new person will you 're out they 're in and the machine kept moving like that and he relies on social security payments to survive when i met him in his apartment he had nothing of value there not even food in his fridge he 's chronically hungry he had nothing of value in his apartment except a small piece of cardboard on which he 'd written the names of his children he cherished this a lot he was happy to show it to me but he can 't pay his fines and fees because he has nothing to give he told me about all the suicide attempts he 's seen in ferguson 's jail so all they could do was yell and yell and yell trying to get the guards ' attention so they could come down and cut him down i heard many stories like this and they shouldn 't have surprised me because suicide is the single leading cause of death in our local jails i met a woman single mother of three making seven dollars an hour she relies on food stamps to feed herself and her children and she can 't afford her fines and fees on those cases since then she 's been jailed about ten times on those cases but she has schizophrenia and bipolar and she needs medication every day she doesn 't have access to those medications in ferguson 's jail because no one has access to their medications she told me about what it was like to spend two weeks in a cage but only one in six receives any mental health care while and when it came time for me to actually see it and to go visit ferguson i 'm not sure what i was expecting to see but i wasn 't expecting this it it reminded me that pending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are or how much of a flight risk you pose immediately writes the check and doesn 't spend a second in a jail cell but sandra bland who died in jail was only there because her family was unable to come up with five hundred dollars in fact there are half a million sandra blands across the country five hundred thousand people who are in jail right now only because they can 't afford their bail amount we they haven 't been convicted of any crime they haven 't pled guilty to any offense right here in san francisco eighty five percent of the inmates in our jail in san francisco are pretrial detainees this means san francisco is spending something like eighty million dollars every year to fund pretrial detention many of these people who are in jail only because they can 't post bail are facing allegations so minor that the amount of time it would take for them to sit waiting for trial is longer than the sentence they would receive if convicted which means they 're guaranteed to get out faster if they just plead guilty so now the choice is should i stay here in this horrible place almost guaranteed to lose my job but once they take that plea deal we 'll call them criminals even though an affluent person would never have been in this situation because an affluent person would have simply been bailed out in actuality i find to me is the thought that these stories can move us to think about jailing in different terms not in sterile policy terms like mass incarceration or sentencing of nonviolent offenders when we put a human being in a cage for days or weeks or months or even years under what conditions are we really willing to do that and so if starting with a few hundred of us in this room we can commit to thinking about jailing in this different light then we can undo that normalization i was referring to earlier if i leave you with anything today i hope it 's with the thought that if we want anything to fundamentally change not just to reform our policies on bail and fines and fees but also to make sure thank you"
