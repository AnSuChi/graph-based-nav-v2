  "transcript": "a paradise lost we generate six hundred and eighty cubic meters of plastic garbage a day that 's about a less than five percent gets recycled mw we know that changes the image you may have of our island and those that don 't even make it to the ocean they 're either burned or littered iw and we have had some significant successes and we go to the best school on earth but also in the way that it teaches we are taught to become leaders of today something a normal textbook cannot match iw one day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people like walking home that day we agreed that why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant we wanted to do something now mw sitting on the sofa that night we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing bali and one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage but that is a huge problem so we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids plastic bags and the idea was born iw and let 's just say the more we learned there was nothing good about plastic bags and you know we don 't even need them mw we were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places from hawaii to rwanda and to severals cities like oakland and dublin iw and so the idea turned into the launch of bye bye plastic bags mw in the years that we have been campaigning we have learned lesson number one and so we formed the bye bye plastic bags crew the volunteer team includes children from all over the island from both international and local schools educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets beach clean ups and last but not least we distribute alternative bags bags like net bags recycled newspaper bags or one hundred percent organic material bags all made by local initiatives on the island iw we focused on making the customers two thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free our first attempts to get the government of bali on board so we thought hmm a petition with one million signatures have guessed one million signatures is like a thousand times a thousand we got stuck someone mentioned that the bali airport handles sixteen million arrivals and departures a year get into the airport and here comes lesson number three persistence we got past the janitor here comes the and after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission and we gave him the bali of plastic bags speech and being a very nice man he said we got almost one thousand signatures how cool is that lesson number four you need champions at all levels of society from students to commercial managers to famous people and thanks to the attraction of green school we had access to a steady stream of of the united nations don 't sign petitions laughter even if kids ask nicely but he promised to spread the word and now we work closely with the united nations mw she 's a real inspiration if you 're a fellow rotarian nice to meet you we 're interactors the youngest department of rotary international iw but we have also learned much about patience mw how to deal with frustrations iw leadership mw teamwork iw friendship mw we learned more about the balinese and their culture iw and we learned about the importance sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk iw you can probably imagine their faces it took a lot of convincing and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day until the governor of bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic bags on bali iw our mogak makan as it is called in bahasa indonesia started we used social media to support our goal and already on day two police started to come to our home and school what were these two girls doing we knew we weren 't making the governor look his best by doing this food hours later we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor mw and there he was waiting for us to meet and speak being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of bali he signed a promise to help the people of bali say no to plastic and we are now friends and on a regular basis we remind him and his team of the promises he has made and indeed recently he stated and committed that bali will be plastic bag free by two thousand and eighteen iw also at the international airport of bali one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic bag free policy by two thousand and sixteen mw stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public iw we check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a and conversely that highlights those who do not have the sticker mw but also because along the way we have learned that kids can do things we can make nor a fixed strategy nor any hidden agendas just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us all we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home kids have a boundless energy and a motivation to be the change the world needs iw so to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world we 're telling you it 's going to be worth it but we are one hundred percent of the future we still have a lot of work to do but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the bali airports will be"
