  "transcript": "first of all any questions so far first of all i have to say i 'm not from around here i 'm from a completely different cultural area maybe you noticed i mean and then secondly i 'm a little bit nervous because i 'm speaking and i just don 't hope you think this is swiss german i 'm speaking now here this is just what it sounds like if we swiss try to speak american i mean 's not my problem it 's your language after all i am fine after this presentation here at ted i can simply go back to switzerland and you have to go on talking like this all the time so but since i 'm here at ted i decided to hold my my talk here in a more modern way in the spirit of ted here and i managed to do some some slides here for you i 'd like to show them around so we can just you know that 's a relatively new term you won 't be familiar with it it 's a hobby of mine that i 've been indulging in for the last few years and it all started out with this picture of the american artist donald baechler i had hanging at home i had to look at it every day and after a while i just couldn 't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long so i decided to give him a little support and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other and you know the world of modern art is particularly topsy turvy and i can show here a very good example it 's actually a simple one but it 's a good one to start with it 's a picture by paul yeah the artist doesn 't really seem to know where to put the different colors mr klee was probably in a hurry of orange and and i would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture we can see now what was barely recognizable in the original seventeen red and orange squares i would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced what you see everything seems to been scattered aimlessly around the space so i 'd like to i wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture and that 's really advanced tidying up yeah you 're right sometimes people clap at this point but that 's actually more in switzerland our trains run on time we are only happy when things are in order but to go on here is a very good example to see this is a picture by joan miro and we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped mr miro could have saved canvas for another picture but i can see in your faces that you 're still 're still a little bit skeptical because i 've had my working methods patented at the i just realized it 's important how one introduces new ideas to people that 's why these patents are sometimes necessary the right hand is the one we write with apart from the left handers and now i 'll count to three i mean it still looks very orderly to me now i 'll count to three and on one two three you can see now that 's a good example even behaving in an orderly systematic way can sometimes we can also see that very clearly in this next painting this is a painting in the original it 's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and and shapes is supposed to depict but in the tidied up version it 's plain to see that it 's a sunburnt woman this one here that 's much better that 's a picture by by keith haring i think it doesn 't matter it 's called untitled and i think that 's appropriate so in the tidied up version we have a sort of keith haring spare parts shop you can see we have twenty five pale green elements of which one is in the form of a circle and the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he 's likely to need you can add them to all the squares of paul klee in the end one has a list with which one then can arrange then you categorize it then you file it put that file in a filing cabinet put it in your office and you can make a living doing it here we have some artists that are a bit more structured it 's not too bad this is jasper johns we can see here he was practicing with his ruler and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it that 's one of my favorites tidying up rene magritte this is really fun you know so once i had the opportunity to stay and before leaving the room each day i 'd scatter a few but then one one i hang the same little sign onto that picture by vincent van gogh and you have to say this this room hadn 't been tidied up since one thousand eight hundred and i can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn 't been properly tidied up so we can make a short test with you this is a picture by rene magritte and i 'd like you all that is to tidy that up so it 's possible that some of you would make it like this i would actually prefer to do it more this way some people would make apple pie out of it but it 's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that time consuming job of as many people imagine with the computer otherwise it would look like this so now i 've been able to tidy up pictures that i 've wanted to tidy up for a it 's oh no it 's that 's a really hard one but after a while i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans here we have the fur cup by meret oppenheim here i just brought it back to its original state you can even go you know or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art the pointillist movement is that kind of and then i this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up so i once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method you can count them afterwards if you like you see that 's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea it 's new so there is no existing tradition in it there is no textbooks that 's how it looks like when you send everyone home maybe you 're asking yourselves where old bruegel 's i would like to show you"
