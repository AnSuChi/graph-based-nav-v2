  "transcript": "am sorry i cannot show you my face because if i do the bad guys will come for me my journey started fourteen years ago i was a young reporter i had just come out of college then i got a scoop the scoop was police officers were taking bribes from hawkers who were hawking on the streets and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system so i decided to go there and act it was fantastic this was what many call immersion i am an undercover journalist shaming and jailing journalism is about results it 's about affecting your community or your society in the most progressive i have worked on this for over fourteen years and i can tell you the results are very good one story that comes to mind in my undercover pieces is spirit child it was about children they were not good enough live in the society so they were given some concoction to take pretended as though this baby and here was the guys who do the killing they got themselves ready in their bids to kill i got the police on standby they came that fateful morning i recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction they and they were about to give it i phoned the police and fortunately and i 'm very sure at the end of the day we will find them and we will put them where they belong too another key story that comes to mind which relates to this spirit child phenomenon is the spell of the albinos i 'm sure most of you may have heard in tanzania children who are born with albinism are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society their bodies are chopped to be used for some concoctions or some potions so i went undercover i filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this and they were ready to buy the arm and they were ready to use it to prepare those potions for people i am glad today the tanzanian government has taken action but the key issue is that the tanzanian government could only take action because the evidence was available my kind of journalism is a product of my society i know he brought out some money from his pockets and utter a word but my colleagues didn 't know so after after collecting the money when he left we were waiting for him to bring the goods i told my colleagues that if they come we will arrest them second official i don 't even you see a hand you see the money in my hands counting whereas i have not come into contact with anybody i have not done any business with anybody reporter when metro news contacted investigative reporter anas aremeyaw anas for his the officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled anas aremeyaw and here was him denying but you see when you have the hard core evidence you sometimes these are some of the headlines that come leading the customs officers into temptation i 'm telling you ghana is not going to say i have a piece i have been undercover i have been there and i can tell you i can only affect society and affect government if i bring out the hard core evidence the prison authorities have denied ever having issues of drug abuse issues of sodomy so many issues they would deny that it ever happens so i was in the prison [ nsawan prison ] what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies now i happen to have followed and i can tell you it was not a nice thing at all there were issues of bad food being served as i recall that some of the food i ate is just not good for a human being toilet facilities very bad i mean you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend and that 's what i call proper when four of us are on a it is something that if you narrate it to somebody the person wouldn 't believe it the only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hard core evidence of course drugs evil in the society is an extreme disease you need to get extreme remedies because usually when people talk about corruption they ask where is the evidence show me the evidence i say this is the evidence you see we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions that is why i was particularly excited when we launched our africa investigates series where we investigated a by the end of it a lot more bad guys on our continent will be put behind bars because i know i have some questions for you how did you end up in jail this was just a few weeks ago i believe yeah aaa sure you know undercover is all about setting the priorities right so we got people to take me to so i went through the very legal process because at the end of the day the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not and that 's how i got in there ca so someone someone sued you in court and they took you there and you were in remand custody for part of it your life at risk how do you do that aaa you see undercover is always a last resort and i 'm only comfortable and i 'm purged of fear whenever i am sure that all the steps i don 't do it alone i have a backup team who help ensure that the safety and all the systems if you don 't you will end up losing your life so yes when the backup systems are put in place i 'm okay i go in risky yes but and once you say that is yours you 've got to take it as and when it comes ca well you 're an amazing human and you 've done amazing work and you 've taught us a story like no story i think any of us have heard before and we 're appreciative we salute you thank you so much"
