  "transcript": "four years ago and because of that announcement we got a big article in the new york times which led to more press which led to more attention and me deciding to become ceo of that company whereas i was an adviser jack presented an idea he 'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends we were also playing with sms at the time at odeo so we kind of put two and two together but i had actually launched blogger as a side project to my previous company thinking it was just a little thing we 'd do on the side and it ended up taking over not only the company but my life for the next five or six years so i learned to follow hunches even though you can 't necessarily and that 's kind of what 's happened with twitter time after time so for those of you unfamiliar twitter is based around a very simple seemingly trivial concept you say what you 're doing in one hundred and forty characters or less so for instance i may twitter right now that i 'm giving a talk and in my case when i hit send up to sixty thousand people will receive that message in a matter of seconds now the fundamental idea is that twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want be they momentous occasions or mundane ones it is by sharing these moments as they 're happening that lets despite distance and in real time this is the primary use we saw of twitter from the beginning one of the things we realized was how important twitter and the l a fire department and red cross used it to dispense news and updates as well at this event dozens of people here are twittering and thousands of people around the world are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what 's happening among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses from marketing and communications and predictable things causing a line to form around the and they 're tweeting in some cases from behind closed door sessions with the president in this case this guy 's not liking what he 's hearing although his tweets have dropped off as of late while senator mccain 's have picked up as have this guy twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium you send one message and it goes out to everybody and you receive the messages you 're interested in one of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific that shaquille o 'neal 's using here to reply to one of his fans was completely invented by users and we didn 't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier this is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system another is via the api we built an application programming interface which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter we currently know about over two thousand pieces of software that can send twitter updates interfaces windows your iphone your blackberry as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby twitter when it kicks and they tapped into the fact that if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they 're doing and what 's around them you have an incredible resource any topic or event while it 's going on this really changed how we perceived twitter for instance here 's what people are saying about ted this is another way that our mind was shifted and twitter wasn 't what we thought it was this not only lets you view some users figured out that they would twitter when they found gas where it was and how much it cost and then appended the keyword # atlgas which let other people search for that and find gas themselves and this trend of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends it 's whether it 's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa or or for a family in crisis people have raised tens of thousands of dollars over twitter in a matter of days on several occasions it seems like when you give people easier ways to share information more good things happen i 've learned to follow the hunch but never assume where it will go this would be the twitter search screen so we 're going to just type a couple of random words into twitter for example evan williams in the eight minutes he was talking there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk so he 'll see every aspect of the reaction the fact that barack obama is the biggest twitterer the fact that it came out of ted i don 't think there 's any other way of getting instant feedback that way"
