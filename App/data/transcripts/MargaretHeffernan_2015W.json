  "transcript": "evolutionary biologist at purdue university named william muir studied chickens he was interested in productivity i think it 's something that concerns all of us but it 's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs he wanted to know what could make his chickens more productive so he devised a beautiful experiment but then he created a second group of the individually most productive chickens you could call them and he put them together in a superflock and each generation he selected only the most productive for breeding after six generations had passed what did he find the average group was doing just fine they were all plump and fully feathered and egg production had increased dramatically well all but three were dead the individually productive chickens had only achieved their success by suppressing the productivity of the rest now as i 've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story in all sorts of organizations and companies people have seen the relevance almost instantly and they come up that 's my life and i 've really never found it very inspiring i 've started and run businesses because invention is a joy and i 've never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by but for the past fifty years we 've run most organizations and some societies along dysfunction and waste if the only way the most productive can be successful is by suppressing the productivity of the rest we badly need to find a better way to work and a richer way to live so what is it that makes some groups well that 's the question a team at mit took to research they brought in hundreds of volunteers they put them into groups and they gave them very hard problems to solve but what was really interesting was that the high achieving groups were not those where they had one or two people with spectacularly high i q nor were the most successful groups the really successful teams and the groups that scored highly on this did better the more successful groups had more women in them was this because women typically score more highly on the reading the mind in the eyes test so you 're getting a doubling down on the empathy quotient or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective we don 't really know but the striking thing about this experiment but what 's key to that so how does this play out in the real world well it means that what happens they don 't waste energy down dead ends an example now this building had to receive two and a half thousand really highly strung and the problem the engineer confronted was what quantity of waste to cater for now you don 't get taught this in engineering school so he could have spent months talking to vets instead he asked for help and he found someone who had designed the jockey club in new york the problem was solved in less than a day and it routinely outperforms individual intelligence helpfulness means i don 't have to know everything i just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help at sap they reckon that you can but there isn 't a single high tech company i 've worked with that imagines for a moment that this is a technology because what drives helpfulness and we think but it doesn 't when i was my first software company i realized that we were getting stuck there was a lot of friction and i gradually realized the brilliant creative people that i 'd hired they were so focused on their own individual work they didn 't even know who they were sitting next to and it was only when i insisted that we stop working and invest time in getting to know each other that we achieved momentum now that was twenty years ago and now i visit companies that have banned coffee cups at desks because they want people to hang out around the coffee machines the swedes even have a special term for this they call it fika which means more than a coffee break it means collective restoration at idexx a company up in maine they 've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people from different parts of the business quite the opposite they 've figured out that when the going gets tough and it always will get tough if you 're doing breakthrough work what people need is social support and they need to know who to ask for help what matters is the mortar not just the bricks when you put all of this together what you get is something called social capital social capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust the term comes from sociologists who were studying communities that proved particularly resilient in times of stress social capital is what gives companies momentum and social capital is what makes companies robust what does this mean in practical terms it means that time because social capital compounds with time so teams that work together longer get better because it takes time to develop the trust you need for real candor and openness is what builds value and employee satisfaction went up ten percent not a bad return on social capital which compounds even as you spend it impatient absolutely determined to think for themselves because that 's what their contribution is conflict is frequent because candor is safe and that 's how good ideas faith and challenge that they achieve their potential and that 's what social capital supports now we aren 't really used to talking about this about talent about creativity in this way we 're used to talking well if we start working so i went and i sat in on the auditions at the royal academy of dramatic art in london they were looking for what happened because that 's where the they don 't last very long it 's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves and when i went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity i couldn 't even see any superstars there and the extraordinary people i 've had the privilege to work with i realized how much more we could give each other if we just stopped trying to be once you appreciate truly how social work is now rivalry has to be replaced by social capital for decades we 've tried to motivate people with money even though we 've got a vast amount of research that shows that money erodes social connectedness now we need to let people motivate and for years we 've thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected all by themselves to solve complex problems now we need to redefine leadership as an activity in which conditions are created in which everyone can do their most courageous thinking together we know that this works when the montreal protocol called for the phasing out of cfcs the chlorofluorocarbons implicated in the hole in the ozone layer the risks were the first was the head of engineering frank maslen said there will be no stars in this team we need everybody everybody has a valid perspective second we work to one standard only the best imaginable and third he told his boss geoff tudhope that he had to butt out because he knew how disruptive and he listened to ensure that they honored their principles and it worked ahead of all the other companies tackling this hard problem this group cracked it first and to date the montreal protocol is the most successful international environmental agreement ever implemented there was a lot at stake then and there 's a lot at stake now and we won 't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved by a few supermen or superwomen now we need because it is only when we accept that everybody has value that we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need to create the best beyond measure"
