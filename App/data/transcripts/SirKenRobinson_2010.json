  "transcript": "i was here four years ago and i remember at the time that the talks weren 't put i think they were given to tedsters in a box a box set of dvds which they put on their shelves where they are now and actually chris called me a week after i 'd given my talk and said we 're going to start putting them online can we put yours online and i said sure it 's there is a hunger for videos of me don 't you feel so this whole event has been an elaborate build up to me doing another one for you so here laughter al gore spoke at the ted conference i spoke at four years ago and so i want to pick up from there because i only had eighteen minutes frankly so as i was saying and i think if people don 't believe it they should get out more which is as severe and i don 't really need the second one but this is a crisis of not natural resources though i believe that 's true but a crisis of human resources i believe fundamentally as many speakers have said during the past few days that we make very poor use our talents i meet all kinds of people who jeremy bentham the great once spiked this argument he said there are two types of people in this world those who divide the world into two types and those who do not well i do i meet all kinds of people who don 't enjoy what they do they simply go through their lives getting on with it but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn 't imagine doing anything else if you said don 't do this anymore they 'd wonder what you 're talking about it isn 't what they do it 's who they are they say it would be foolish to abandon this because it speaks to my most authentic self and dislocates very many people from their natural talents and human resources are like and you might imagine education would be the way that happens but too often it 's not every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it 's not is no use anymore because that 's simply improving a broken model what we need and the word 's been used many times in the past few days is not evolution but a revolution in education this has to be transformed into something else one of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education innovation is hard because it means doing something that people don 't find very easy for the most part it means challenging what we take for granted things that we think are obvious the great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense things i came across a great quote recently from abraham lincoln who i thought you 'd be pleased to have quoted at this point laughter he said this in december one thousand eight hundred and sixty two to the second annual meeting of congress i ought to explain that i have no idea what was happening at the time we don 't teach american history you know this is our policy laughter no doubt something fascinating was happening which the americans among us will be aware of but he said this the dogmas of the quiet past and we must rise with it as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country you know what it means that there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things the way things are and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them and the reason is that you take it for granted laughter let me ask you something you may take for granted how many of you here are over the age of twenty five that 's not what you take for granted i 'm sure you 're familiar with that are those over twenty five could you put your hands up if you 're wearing your wristwatch now that 's a great deal of us isn 't it ask a room full of teenagers the same thing i don 't mean they can 't they just often choose not to they see no reason to do this and by the way you don 't need either it 's just that you 've always done it my daughter never wears a watch my daughter kate who 's twenty she doesn 't see the point as she says a couple of examples one of them is the idea of linearity that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right you will end up set for the rest of your life everybody who 's spoken that life is not linear it 's organic we create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us i think we are obsessed with getting people to college not right away and i was up in san francisco a while ago doing a book signing there was this guy buying a book everybody wanted to be a fireman he said and he said when i got to the senior year of school he said i was throwing my life away i chose to do with it that i should go to college i should become a professional person that i had great potential and i was wasting my talent to do that i saved his and i saved his wife 's life as well he said i think he thinks better of me and at the heart of our challenges at the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence this linearity thing is a problem i came across a policy statement if we had time i could go into this but we don as we just heard in this last session there 's such competition now to get into kindergarten to get to the right kindergarten that people are being interviewed for it kids sitting in front of we have built our education systems on the model of fast food there are two models of quality assurance in catering one is fast food where everything is they 're customized to local circumstances and we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education and it 's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies applause we have to recognize a couple of things here one is that human talent is tremendously diverse people have very different aptitudes i worked out recently that i was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that eric clapton got his first guitar laughter it worked out for eric that 's all i 'm saying in a way it did not for me i could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard i blew into it it 's not only about that it 's about passion often people are good at things they don 't really care for and what excites our spirit and our energy and if you 're doing the thing that you love to do that you 're good at time takes a different course entirely and you know this if you 're doing something you love an hour feels like five minutes five minutes feels like an hour we have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education a manufacturing model which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture and you cannot predict the outcome of human development all you can do like a farmer is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish there are many great and doing that i think is the answer to the future because it 's about creating a movement in education but with external support based on a personalized curriculum now in this room there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business in multimedia combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers provide an opportunity to revolutionize education and i urge you to get involved because it 's vital not just to ourselves but to the future of our children but we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model where each school can be flourishing and i wanted to just very quickly he wrote this to his and he was and he says i 've got something else but it may not be for you he says this heavens ' embroidered cloths enwrought with gold and silver light the blue and the dim and the dark cloths of night and light and the half light but i being poor have only my dreams i have spread my dreams under your feet tread softly because you tread on my dreams and we should tread softly"
