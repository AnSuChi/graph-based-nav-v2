  "transcript": "after having served four years in the united states marine corps and deployments to both iraq and afghanistan i found myself in port au prince leading a team of veterans and medical professionals in some of three days after the earthquake we we realized something military veterans are very very good at disaster response and coming home my cofounder and i we looked at it and we said there are two problems the first problem is there 's inadequate disaster response it 's slow it 's 's not using the best technology and it 's not using the best people the second problem that we became aware of and what do i mean by that well we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home recent surveys show that ninety two percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform and we can use veterans when one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the but it really forced us clay didn 't kill himself because of what happened in iraq and afghanistan clay killed himself he lost his self worth we realized that of those two problems we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran but after clay we shifted that focus and suddenly now moving forward we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that 's using disaster response because we think that we can give that purpose and that community back to the veteran and tornadoes in tuscaloosa and joplin and then later hurricane irene gave us an opportunity to look at that now i want you to imagine for a second every day he leaves the wire with a mission that mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left he regains that every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him he leaves the wire he knows that those he doesn 't have that community anymore again you have an he 's no longer sergeant jones in his community he 's now dave from kansas city he doesn 't have that same self worth but you send him to joplin after a tornado and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service now"
