  "transcript": "yeah let 's project out into the future to your future now everyone look at two people one of you probably has alzheimer 's disease in some way this terrifying disease is likely to affect us all part of the fear around alzheimer 's stems from the sense that there 's nothing we can do about it so if we 're lucky enough to live long enough alzheimer 's appears to be our but maybe it doesn 't have to be here 's a picture of two neurons connecting the point of connection this space circled in red is called the synapse the synapse is where neurotransmitters are released this is where signals are transmitted where communication happens let 's zoom in on the synapse and look at a cartoon representation of what 's going on during the business of communicating information in addition to releasing neurotransmitters like glutamate into the synapse neurons also release a small peptide called amyloid beta normally amyloid beta is cleared away metabolized by while the molecular causes of alzheimer 's are still debated most and when this happens it binds to itself forming sticky aggregates called amyloid plaques how many people here are forty years old or older you 're afraid to admit it now initial step into the disease this presence of amyloid plaques accumulating can already be found in your brains you are blissfully unaware you 're not showing any impairments in memory language or cognition your lapses in memory might include things like why did i come in this room or oh what 's his name or where did i put my keys before you all start freaking out again because i know half of you did at least one of those in the last twenty four hours these are all normal kinds of forgetting the glitches in instead of eventually finding your keys in your coat pocket or on the table by the door you find them in the refrigerator or you find them and you think what are these for our microglia janitor cells become we think they might actually start clearing away the synapses themselves a crucial neural transport protein called and twists itself into something called tangles which choke off the neurons from the inside so if you were a scientist trying to cure this disease at what point would you ideally want to intervene which means that drug discovery is largely focused on developing a compound that will prevent eliminate or reduce amyloid plaque accumulation so the cure for alzheimer 's will likely be a preventative medicine we think this is why to date these kinds of drugs have failed in clinical trials not because the science wasn 't sound but because the people in these trials were already symptomatic it was too late once the forest is ablaze it doesn 't do any good to blow out the match you have to blow out the match before the forest catches fire even before scientists sort this out this information is actually really good news for us because it turns out that the way we live can influence the accumulation of amyloid plaques and so there are things we can do to let 's imagine you 're fifty years old you now let 's look at we 've all inherited our genes from our moms and our dads some of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it but for most of us the genes we inherit will only tip the arm a bit for example so what does we can 't do anything about getting older or the genes we 've inherited so far we haven 't changed our brain 's destiny what about sleep deep sleep is like a power cleanse for the brain but what happens if you shortchange yourself on sleep many scientists believe that poor sleep hygiene might actually be a predictor of a single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in amyloid beta which in turn causes more amyloid to accumulate and so now we have this positive feedback loop that 's going to accelerate the tipping of that scale what else some autopsy studies have shown that as many as eighty percent of people with alzheimer 's also had cardiovascular disease aerobic exercise has been shown in many studies to decrease amyloid beta in animal models of the disease mediterranean lifestyle and diet can help to counter the tipping of this scale but let 's say you haven 't done any of them let 's say and you don 't run unless someone 's chasing you but you might not be be even if you have the full blown disease pathology ablaze in your brain it has to do with neural plasticity and cognitive reserve remember the experience of having alzheimer 's is ultimately a result of losing we gain and lose synapses all the time through a process called neural plasticity every time we learn something new we are creating and strengthening new neural connections new synapses six hundred all over the age of seventy five when the study began were followed for more than two decades and when they died their brains were all donated for autopsy despite the presence of plaques and tangles and brain shrinkage what appeared to be unquestionable which is a way of saying that they had more functional synapses people who have more years of formal education who have a high degree of literacy who engage regularly in mentally stimulating activities all have more cognitive reserve they have an abundance you know that lisa genova wrote still alice and that 's the only thing now when someone asks you hey who wrote ' still alice ' you can 't remember because that synapse is either failing or gone you 've forgotten me forever now imagine you have alzheimer 's and three of those synapses are damaged or destroyed so we can be resilient to the presence of alzheimer 's pathology through the recruitment by learning new things so this really doesn 't mean doing crossword puzzles you don 't want to simply retrieve information you 've already because this is like traveling down old familiar streets cruising neighborhoods you already know and if despite all of this you are someday diagnosed with alzheimer keep living you won 't lose your emotional memory you 'll still be able to understand love and joy and you are more than what you can remember"
