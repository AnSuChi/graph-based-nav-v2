  "transcript": "so we 're just going to dive right in at a complex place new jersey because thirty years ago i 'm and this was my childhood bedroom and that 's where everyone would hang and every time i took a shower and would come back in a towel and i looked like this i was and that 's architecture it 's about those visceral emotional and it 's no surprise that we feel that way because according to the epa americans spend ninety percent of their time indoors it means that when i show you a building like this i know what you think you think power and stability and democracy and i know you think that because it 's based on a building that was build two thousand five hundred years ago by the greeks this is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of we used it to build houses and look at these solid stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements this is really really useful and the people that build things developers and governments they 're naturally afraid of innovation and they 'd rather just use those forms that they know you 'll respond to that 's how we end up with buildings like this this is the livingston public library that was completed in two thousand and four in my hometown and you know and you can kind of guess what livingston is trying to say with this building but it doesn 't have much to do with what a library actually this library it 's about a new kind of public amenity for the city a place to gather and read and share so how is it possible look so completely different and the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum on the one side is innovation and architects are constantly pushing pushing for new technologies new typologies new solutions and we push and we push and we push until until we completely alienate all of you we wear all black we get very depressed you think we 're adorable okay thirty years ago we were coming out of the ' 70s architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism it 's about concrete dehumanizing scale this so as we get closer to the ' 80s we take these forms that we know you love and we update them we add neon and we add pastels and we we take chippendale armoires and we turned those into skyscrapers and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass dwarves became columns swans grew to the size of buildings it was and out there they can be mediterranean or french or italian this isn 't tuscany this is ohio so architects get frustrated and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction in the late ' 90s we start experimenting with something called we throw out historical symbols we rely on new computer aided design techniques it 's super and then something amazing happened in paul goldberger said that bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics and the general public were completely united around a building the new york times called this building a miracle everybody wants one of these he is our very first now how is it possible that these forms they 're wild and radical how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout and it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism we created an emotional reaction to these forms so did every mayor in the world so every mayor knew that if they had these forms they had culture and tourism this phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium happened to a few other starchitects it happened to zaha and what happened to these elite few architects at the turn of the new millennium could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture as digital media starts to increase the speed with which we consume information transportation speeds up you can take a boat you can take a plane you can be a tourist we are all architectural and in the interim an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not that 's how we end up with buildings like this brutalism wasn 't a two year movement we were producing buildings like this because we had no idea how much you hated it it 's never going to happen again because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete of steel or of and it 's a media revolution so my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum it starts swinging faster and faster until it 's at both emotionally charged symbols out of something that 's brand new let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed we proposed a building that was audacious that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to and we were scared and our client was scared so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto facebook and we put onto instagram it was so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product and then that first summer when people started arriving and sharing the building on the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media and what you 're doing all of our collective memory and you 're making these charged symbols for us to understand because digital media hasn 't just changed the relationship between all of us it 's changed the relationship between us and buildings think for a second about those librarians back in livingston if that building was going to be built today today the first thing they would do is go online and search new libraries they would be bombarded by examples of experimentation of innovation of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be that 's ammunition that 's ammunition that they can take with them to the mayor of livingston to the people of livingston and say there 's no one answer to what a let 's be a part of this this abundance of experimentation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment everything is different now architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings and you hapless public the consumer that won 't accept anything that they haven 't seen anymore we can actually move forward this is the end it means that it means that a stadium in brooklyn can be a stadium in brooklyn not some and it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around it means that a parking garage in miami beach florida can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night it means that no building is too small for innovation like this little reindeer pavilion that 's as muscly and sinewy and it means that a building doesn 't have to be beautiful to be lovable like this ugly little building in spain where the architects dug a hole and then poured concrete around it and when the concrete they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that 's left when it 's done is this hideous little room that 's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a spanish sunset because it doesn 't matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings it doesn 't matter how we build it matters what we build architects already know how to make buildings that are greener and smarter and friendlier we 've just been waiting for all of you to want them find an architect hire an architect work with us to design better buildings better because the stakes are high buildings don 't just reflect our society they shape our society and the walk that they take from the bedroom thank you"
