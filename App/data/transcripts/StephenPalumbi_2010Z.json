  "transcript": "but what i 'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity there 's some simple themes that i think if we understand those simple themes aren 't really we know that right we 've experienced that and if we just take that and we build from there ain 't nobody happy the theme of my talk and we 're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways this is a shot of cannery row in one thousand nine hundred and thirty two cannery row at the time we piled enormous amounts of pollution fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead based paints black people working in these canneries could barely stay they say you know what you smell you smell money and we made them unhealthy hurt a whale the pyramid of ocean life now when an ecologist looks at the ocean i have to tell you we look at the ocean in a very different way and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean the plankton the small things and we see how those animals are food to animals and that flow that flow of life from the very base up to the very top is the flow that ecologists see and that 's what we 're trying to preserve when we say save the ocean heal the ocean it 's that pyramid now why does that matter for for human health because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn 't be there some very frightening things happen pollutants some pollutants and they drift up they 're passed up that way on to predators and on to the top predators and in so doing they accumulate now to bring that home i thought i 'd invent a little game we don 't really have to play it we can just think about it here it 's the styrofoam and chocolate game imagine that when we got on this boat we were all given two styrofoam peanuts can 't do much with them in your pocket suppose the rules are every time you offer somebody a drink you give them the drink and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too what 'll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here and they will accumulate in the drunkest stingiest people there 's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into they accumulate into the top of it now suppose instead of styrofoam peanuts we take these lovely little chocolates that we get they will just pass into our and that 's the difference between a pcb and say something natural like an omega 3 something we want out of the marine food chain we have great examples of that unfortunately pcbs accumulate in dolphins in sarasota bay in texas in north carolina they get into the food chain the dolphins eat and those pcbs being accumulate in these dolphins and what 's that in mother 's milk here 's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay males a huge load juveniles a huge load females after their first calf is already weaned a lower load those females they 're not trying to those females are passing the pcbs in the fat of their own mother 's milk into their offspring now the mother then can go and reproduce but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals the death of the first born calf there 's another top predator in the and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places this is whale meat that i photographed in a grocery store in tokyo or is it in fact what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into tokyo and use it to genetically test the dna out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat some of them were illegal whale meat by the way that 's another story and those dolphin parts had and that huge load was passing into the people that that this meat it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world that 's a tragedy for those populations but it 's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don 't know that that 's toxic meat we had these data a few years ago i remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat and it was toxic it had times the toxic loads ever allowed by the epa and i remember there sitting at my my desk thinking well i know this this this is a great scientific discovery but it was so awful we sent a very polite letter to the minister of minister of health in japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation not for us but for the people of japan because mothers who may be but it was really toxic that led to a whole series of other campaigns in japan and i 'm really proud to say that at this point it 's very which i believe they shouldn 't but but in a natural diet of some communities in the canadian arctic and in the united states and in the european arctic a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of pcbs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women these women have toxic breast milk they cannot feed their offspring their children their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain in their part of the world 's ocean pyramid that means their immune systems are compromised it means that and the world 's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women that 's a good thing for this particular acute problem but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem there 's other ways of breaking the pyramid and if we jam nutrients sewage fertilizer in the base of that which are blooms of toxic algae we can also see blooms of bacteria blooms of viruses in the ocean these are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio which includes the genus that has cholera in it how many people have seen a beach closed now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you very often we wouldn 't tolerate that we wouldn 't tolerate our parks being they 're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason and i believe we shouldn 't tolerate that either it 's not just a question of cleanliness it 's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease these vibrios these bacteria can actually infect people they can go into your skin and create skin infections this is a graph from noaa 's ocean and human health initiative showing the rise of the infections by vibrio and if you can see on some surfing sites in fact not only do you see what that means that the beach might have great waves but it 's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them even after a great day of surfing this legacy and that makes them even more difficult these same infections create harmful algal blooms those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals this is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms shellfish poisoning fish ciguatera diarrheic shellfish poisoning you don 't want to know about that neurotoxic shellfish poisoning paralytic shellfish poisoning rita calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease that has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn 't move these vectors of cholera around the world so what do you do we have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow well there 's a bunch of things you could do not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems there have been places where problems have been fixed where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around monterey is one of those i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems in one thousand nine hundred and thirty two that 's the picture in two thousand and nine the picture is dramatically different but there 's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems they need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top pyramid in monterey right now because of the efforts of a lot of different people is functioning better than it 's ever functioned for the last one hundred it didn 't happen accidentally it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this on the left there julia platt the mayor of my little hometown in pacific grove right next to the biggest polluting cannery because julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone the ocean needed a place to grow from that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed and she wanted to provide that seed other people like david packard and julie packard who were instrumental in producing the monterey bay aquarium to lock into people 's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be i want to leave you with the thought that what we 're really and we think of but and it 's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves thank you very much"
