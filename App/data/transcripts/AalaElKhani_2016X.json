  "transcript": "over one point five billion people experience armed conflict in response people are forced to flee their country leaving over fifteen million refugees children without a doubt are the most innocent and vulnerable victims the experiences of war leave children at a real high risk for the development of emotional and behavioral problems the quality of care that children receive in their families can have a more significant effect on their well being than from the actual experiences of war that they have been exposed to so actually children can be protected by warm secure parenting during and after conflict in two thousand and eleven i was a first year phd student in the university of manchester school of psychological sciences i watched the crisis in syria unfold in front of me on the tv my family is originally from syria and very early on i lost several family members in really horrifying ways we 've all seen those scenes bombs destroying they were five and six then at an age where they typically asked lots and lots of questions and expected real convincing answers i began to wonder what it might be like to parent my children in a war zone and a refugee camp would my children change would my daughter 's bright happy eyes lose their shine would my son 's really relaxed and carefree nature would i change as psychologists and parent trainers we know that arming parents with skills in caring for their children can have a huge effect on their well being and we call this parent training the question i had was could parent training programs be useful for families while they were still in war zones or refugee camps could we reach them with advice or training that would help them through professor rachel calam with the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world i wasn 't quite sure what exactly i wanted to do and it means so much to you then let 's do it let 's find ways to see if parent programs can be useful for families in these contexts so for the past five right i mean it seems obvious but it 's often those that are the most vulnerable that we 're trying to support that we actually don 't ask how many times have we just assumed we know exactly the right thing that 's going to help someone or something without actually asking them first and i sat with families and i listened i listened to their parenting challenges i listened to their parenting struggles and i listened to their call for help and sometimes that was just paused as all i could do was hold hands with them and just join them in silent crying and prayer harsh refugee camp conditions that made it hard to focus on anything but practical chores like collecting clean water they told me how they watched their children withdraw fear of loud noises fear of nightmares the mothers almost half of them were now widows of war or didn 't even know if their husbands were dead or alive they watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them they didn 't know how to answer their children 's questions they were making attempts at seeking support from ngo from refugee camp teachers professional medics other parents and had already made two attempts at seeking support for her eight year old daughter but sadly these attempts are almost always useless or don 't have the knowledge or the time for basic parenting supports camp teachers and other parents are just like them part of a new refugee community who 's struggling with new needs the families were struggling with with things much bigger than they could cope with the syrian crisis made it clear how incredibly impossible it would be to reach families on an individual level how else could we help them how would we reach families at a population level and low costs in these terrifying terrifying times after hours of speaking to ngo workers one suggested a fantastic innovative idea of distributing parenting information leaflets via bread wrappers bread wrappers that were being delivered to one was a parenting information leaflet that had basic advice and information that normalized to the parent what they might be experiencing such as information like spending time talking to your child showing them more affection the other piece of paper was a feedback questionnaire and of course there was a pen so is this simply or is actually a possible means of delivering psychological first aid that provides warm secure loving parenting we managed to distribute three thousand of these in just one week what sixty percent of the three thousand families responded i don but that kind of response rate is fantastic let alone in a conflict zone in syria really highlighting how important these kinds of messages were to families but my favorite has got to be thank you for not forgetting about us and this really illustrates the potential means of the delivery of psychological first aid to families and the return of feedback too just imagine replicating this using other means such as because the refugee crisis is one that is having an effect on every single one of us we 're bombarded with images daily of statistics over one million refugees had reached europe one million so we 've adapted the leaflet to meet the needs of european in areas with a really high refugee influx it was downloaded three hundred and forty three times practitioners and other parents to have open access psychological first aid messages in two thousand and thirteen i was sitting on the cold hard floor of a refugee camp tent across from me stood an elderly lady with what seemed to be a 13 year old girl lying beside her with her head on the elderly lady 's knees the girl stayed quiet throughout the focus group not talking at all with her knees curled up against her the end of the focus group and as i was thanking the mothers for their time the elderly lady looked at me while pointing at the young girl and said to me can you help us with i looked at the young girl and smiled and in arabic i said salaam alaikum shu ismak what 's your name she looked at me really confused and unengaged but then said is the pet 's name for the arabic female name hala and is only really used to refer to really young girls at that point i realized that actually hala was probably much older than thirteen but the war had changed all of that she had lived through when they reached the refugee camp and she knew they were finally in some kind of safety she completely withdrew to acting like her old childhood self she completely rejected her family hala simply could no longer cope but sadly it 's not uncommon those who experience armed conflict and displacement will face serious emotional struggles and that 's something we can all if you have been through a devastating time in your life if you have lost someone or something you really care about could you still be able to care for yourself and for your family given that the first years of a child 's life are crucial for healthy physical and emotional development and that one point five billion people are experiencing armed conflict many of whom are now joining our communities we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the needs of those who are experiencing war and displacement we must prioritize these families ' needs both those who are internally displaced when we begin to notice those intricate emotions on their faces we begin to see them as humans and these are the real human needs when these family needs are prioritized interventions for children in humanitarian settings family mental health will be shouting loud and clear in global international agenda and children will be less likely and we will be more more welcoming more caring and more trusting to those who are joining our communities we need to stop wars we need to build a world where children can dream of planes dropping gifts and not bombs"
