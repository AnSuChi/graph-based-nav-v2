  "transcript": "so this video was taken at aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of key largo about sixty feet below the surface and last year they invited us along for the ride all the footage was taken from our open rov which is a robot that we built in our garage which in our case means our little robot it 's open source meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design it 's built with mostly off the shelf parts and costs about one thousand times cheaper than the rovs james cameron used to explore the titanic oil and gas companies use them for exploration so my friend eric and i decided we wanted to explore this underwater we had heard this story about lost gold from a gold rush era robbery and we wanted to go up there unfortunately we didn 't have any money and we didn 't have any tools to do it so eric had an initial design idea for a robot we asked the internet for help we created this website openrov com and shared our intentions and our plans for the first few months it was just eric and i talking back to each other on the forums we kept working on it we learned a lot we kept prototyping and eventually we decided we wanted to go to the cave we were ready so about that time our little expedition became quite a story and it got picked up in the new york times and we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted so but then we had to learn how to make them i mean we had to learn small batch manufacturing so but we were able to do it we got all the kits we 've also learned the penguins love robots we 're still publishing all the designs online encouraging anyone to build these themselves that 's the only way that we could have done this by being open source we 've created this distributed r & d network and we 're moving faster than any venture backed counterpart but the actual robot is really only half the story the real potential the long term potential is with this community of diy ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe what can we discover when there 's thousands so you 're probably all wondering the cave did you find the gold well but we decided that what we found was much more valuable it was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration"
