  "transcript": "german girl called vera brandes the auditorium was empty it was lit only by the dim green glow of the emergency exit sign this was the most exciting day of vera 's life she was the youngest concert promoter in germany and she had persuaded the cologne opera house to host a late night concert of jazz from the american musician in just a few hours jarrett would walk out on the same stage he 'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal but right now vera was introducing keith to the piano in question and it wasn 't going well muttered something to his producer producer came over to vera and said if you don 't get a new piano keith can 't play there 'd been a mistake the white notes were out of tune the pedals didn 't work so keith jarrett he went and sat outside in his car leaving vera brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano but she couldn 't get a new piano and so she went outside and she stood there in the rain talking to keith jarrett begging him took pity on her and said only for you jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house he sat down at the unplayable piano and began jarrett was avoiding those upper registers he was sticking to the middle tones of the desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row it 's an electrifying performance it somehow has this peaceful quality and at the same time it 's full of energy it 's dynamic and the audience loved it continue to love it because the recording of the kln concert is the best selling piano album in history and the best selling solo jazz album in history but let 's think for a moment about but jarrett 's instinct was wrong and thank goodness he changed his mind i think our instinct is also wrong i think we need to gain a bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantages and of course so cognitive psychology first we so the regular handout would be like and they 're difficult fonts to read but and the students who 'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts had actually done better on their exams in a variety of subjects and the reason is and so they learned more the psychologist shelley carson has been testing harvard undergraduates for the the quality of their attentional filters what do i mean by that what i mean is imagine you 're in a restaurant you 're having a conversation you want to filter them out you want to focus on what 's important to you can you do that if you can but some people really struggle with that some of carson 's undergraduate subjects struggled with that they had weak filters they had porous filters let a lot of external information in and so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them if there was a television on while they were doing their essays they couldn 't screen it out now you would think that that was a disadvantage when carson looked at what these students had achieved the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely to have some real creative milestone in their lives to have published their first novel to have released their first album these distractions were actually grists to their creative mill they were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes you try to make a the materials all the different dimensions the shape you can 't solve that kind of problem all in one go it 's too hard so what do you do well one thing you can do is try to solve it step by step you improve it now this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine and it 's been quite widely implemented in the world so you 'll hear about it for example in high performance cycling web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages they 're looking for these step by step gains that 's a good way to solve a complicated problem but you know what would make it a better way a you add randomness early on in the process you make crazy moves you try stupid things that shouldn 't work and and the reason for that is the trouble with the step by step process the marginal gains is they can walk you gradually down a dead end and if you start with the randomness that becomes less likely and your problem solving becomes more robust let so the the psychologist katherine phillips with some colleagues recently gave murder mystery problems to some students and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime alibis and evidence witness statements and three suspects who committed the crime and there were two treatments in this experiment they all knew each other well in other cases three friends and a stranger and they did they solved the problem they only had a 50 50 chance of getting the answer right which is actually not that great in multiple choice for three answers 50 50 's not good even though the stranger didn 't have any extra information even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to they had a seventy five percent chance of finding the right answer that 's quite a big leap in performance but i think what 's really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job but how they felt about it so when katherine phillips interviewed they had a nice time they also thought they 'd done a good job they were complacent they had not had a nice time it 's actually rather difficult it 's rather awkward they didn 't think they 'd done a good job even though they had and i think that really exemplifies the challenge that we 're dealing with here yeah the the ugly font the awkward stranger the random move these disruptions and so we resist and that 's why the last example is really important so want to talk about somebody from the background of the world of rock ' n ' roll and you may know him he 's actually a ted ster he 's also a kind of catalyst behind some of the great rock ' n ' roll albums of the last forty years he 's worked with david bowie on and what does he do to make these great rock bands better well it 's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano and one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through this remarkable deck of cards i have my my signed copy here thank you brian they 're called the oblique strategies he developed them with a friend of his and when they 're stuck in the studio brian eno will reach for one of the cards he 'll draw one at random and he 'll make the band follow the instructions on the card everyone swap instruments drummer on the piano brilliant idea look closely at the most embarrassing details amplify them make a sudden destructive unpredictable action incorporate they 've proved their worth in album after phil collins was playing drums on an early brian eno album he got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio carlos alomar great rock guitarist working with eno on david bowie 's lodger album and at one point he turns to brian and says brian this experiment but the thing is it and he tells his students to use the oblique strategies because he 's realized something just because you don 't like it doesn 't mean it isn 't helping you the strategies actually weren 't a deck of cards originally a list list on the recording studio wall a checklist of things you might try if you got stuck the list didn 't work know why not messy enough your eye would go down the list and it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive the least troublesome and what brian eno came to realize was yes we need to run the stupid experiments but also we really need some persuasion whether it 's the flip of a card or whether it 's a guilt trip from a german teenager all of us from time to time need to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano thank you"
