  "transcript": "and so i started thinking about i thought why don 't i make her an interactive mother 's day card using the scratch software that i 'd been developing with my research group at the mit media lab so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive card for my mom before making my own mother 's day card i thought i would take a look so over the last several years kids around the world ages eight and up have shared their projects so in the search box i typed in mother 's day and i was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of mother 's day cards that showed up on the scratch website so i started taking a look at them i saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy mother 's day and the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom another one was an interactive project where when you moved the mouse over the letters of happy mom day it reveals a special happy mother 's day slogan music in the creator told a narrative about how she had googled to find out when mother 's day was happening typing and then once she found out when mother 's day was happening she delivered a special mother 's day greeting of how much she loved her mom so i really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects in fact i liked it so much that instead of making my own project i sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects and actually she reacted exactly the way that i hoped that she would she wrote back to me and she said i 'm so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother 's day cards for their mothers but actually i was even happier for another reason i was happy because these kids were using scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies what do i mean by fluent i mean that they were able to start expressing themselves and to start expressing their ideas and it 's similar with new technologies a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology i mean all of us have heard young people referred to as digital natives and there 's no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming but that doesn 't really make you fluent so young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies it 's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies and i 'm really interested in seeing how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies and that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs or code people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code you know in recent years there have been you look online you 'll see places like codecademy or black it seems that everybody is getting into the act you know just at the beginning of this year at the turn of the new year new york city mayor michael bloomberg made a new year 's resolution that he was going to learn to code in two thousand and twelve a few months later the country of estonia decided that and that triggered a debate in the u k about whether all the children there should learn to code when many people think of coding they think of it as something and in fact if this is what coding is it will only be a narrow sub community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background so in scratch to code you just snap blocks together in this case you take a move block snap it into a stack and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story in this case controlling after you 've created your program you can click on share and then share your project with other people so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well so of course making a fish game isn 't the only thing you can do with scratch of the millions of projects on the scratch website there 's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials so i think there 's so many different ways that people can express themselves using this to be able to take here 's an example from hong kong where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor so the light sensor detects the hole in the so as they move the physical saw the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree we 're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us this is an example from a new version of scratch that we 'll be releasing in the next few months and i can pop the balloons or i can move the bug so it 's a little bit like microsoft kinect where you interact with gestures in the world but instead of just playing someone else 's game you get to create the games and if you see someone else 's game you can just say inside and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it so there 's a new block that says how much video motion there is and then if there 's so much video motion it will then tell the balloon to pop the same way that this uses the camera here 's an example of a project using the so i 'm going to let all of you control this game using your voices but it enables them when you learn to read you can then here 's another project and i saw this when i was visiting one of the computer clubhouses these are after school learning centers that we helped start that help young people from low income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game but also he wanted to do more he wanted to keep score so that each time the big fish eats the little fish the score would go up and it would keep track and he didn 't know how to do that so i showed him you can create something called a variable and that creates some new blocks for you and also creates so each time i click on so i showed this to the clubhouse member let 's call him victor and victor when he saw that this block would let him increment the score he knew exactly what to do he took the block and he put and the score and it 's in fact working and he saw and he was so excited he reached his hand out to me and he said thank you thank you thank you and what went through my mind was how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables but that 's because in most classrooms when kids learn about variables you can learn it in a way that 's really meaningful and and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better victor and coding to learn you 're learning it in a meaningful but that 's just the start as victor worked on this project and created the scripts he was also learning about the process of design how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully fledged functioning project like so he was learning many different core principles of design about how to experiment with new ideas how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts how to collaborate with other people on your projects about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong now those are important skills that he 'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer that these ideas are useful for everybody when you become fluent with reading and writing it 's not something that you 're doing just to become a professional writer very few people become professional writers but it 's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write again the same thing with coding most people won 't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers but those skills of thinking creatively reasoning systematically working collaboratively skills you develop when you code in scratch are things that people can use no matter what they 're doing in their work lives and it 's not just about your work life coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life let me end with just one more example so this is an example that came from after i had sent so she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday scratch card now this project is not going to win any prizes for design and you can rest assured that my but working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity so all of i 'd encourage you to go to the scratch website it"
