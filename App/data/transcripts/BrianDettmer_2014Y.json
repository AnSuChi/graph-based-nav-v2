  "transcript": "i wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they 're just looking at a regular stack of books but then as they see this rough hole carved into it and wonder what was happening wonder why and think about the material of the book so i 'm interested in the texture but i 'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books in most of my work what i do is i seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish so it 's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book so it becomes a solid material but then the pages inside and then i carve into the surface of the book and i 'm not moving or adding anything i 'm just i think of my work as sort of a remix in a way because i 'm working with somebody else 's material in the same way that a d j might be working with somebody else 's music this was a book of raphael paintings i 'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book and pushing that linear format and try to push the structure of the book itself so that the book can become fully sculptural i 'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials in order to hold things in place before i varnish so that i can push the form before i begin so that something like this which is just made from a single dictionary or something like this can become a piece like this which who knows what that 's going to be or and they 're created to relate to our and i also think of the book as a machine and as i so one of the things i do is when i 'm carving through the book because what 's interesting is that when we 're reading text when we 're reading a book so we 're sort of filling that piece we 're sort of creating images when we 're reading text and when we 're looking at an image we actually use language in order to understand what we 're looking at so there 's sort of a yin yang that happens of a flip flop so i 'm creating a piece that the the viewer is and i think of my work as almost an archaeology i 'm excavating and i 'm trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as i possibly can and exposing it within my own work and what 's happening and this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers but now that we don 't have a physical backup has to be constantly updated in order to not lose it and i do use a computer every day and if i need to look up a word i 'll go on the computer because i can go directly and instantly to what so i don 't think that the book will ever really die people think that now now that we have digital technology the book is going to die and we are seeing things shifting and things evolving i think that the book will evolve and just like people said painting would die when photography and printmaking became everyday materials but what it really allowed painting to do was it allowed painting to quit its day job it allowed painting to not have to have that everyday and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story and that 's when we saw and i think that 's what 's happening with books now now that most of our technology most of our information most of our personal and cultural records so i think it 's a very exciting thank you"
