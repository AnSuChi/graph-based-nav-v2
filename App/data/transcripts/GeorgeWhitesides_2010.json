  "transcript": "most of the talks that you 've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something they are they know what 's going on all of you know about the topic that i 'm supposed to talk about that is you know what simplicity is you know what complexity is and what i 'm going to do is share with you my ignorance on this subject the quote is from the fabled potter stewart opinion on the important details here but i know it when i see it i 'm going to come back to that in a moment so what is the handle enables you to hold it when the container is filled with hot liquid why is that important well it enables you to drink coffee but also by the way the coffee is hot the liquid is sterile you 're not likely to get cholera so the coffee cup or the cup with a handle is one of the tools used by society to maintain public health glasses enable you to see things and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs or run down by automobiles and books are after all your education which has some characteristics very different from those that my friend benoit mandelbrot discussed but are very interesting so there are two ways of thinking about this word i think and here i 've corrupted the potter stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone internet and birth control pills or which is to think about the problem in terms of what if you associate with moral philosophers is called the teapot problem and the teapot is filled with hot water it 's like what is simplicity one answer would because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly that 's a kind of physical science argument a second argument would be because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on that 's an historical argument a third is that i wanted hot water for since this is coming from a moral philosopher the fourth would be that it 's part of god 's plan for the universe all of these are possibilities the point is that you get but with the same words asking what is simplicity i think falls in that category what is the state of science and is very highly evolved we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is for reasons that are a little bit obscure is almost not pursued at least in the academic world so you 're not responsible for outcomes so what one is interested in has a lot to do with the rewards of the system and there 's a lot of rewards in thinking about complexity and emergence not so much in thinking about simplicity one of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task which you may not know that you have very often which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation we have actually a pretty good working definition of complexity it turns out that whenever you have that weird stuff happens and you in los angeles probably know this better than anyone you can 't possibly read that it 's not intended that you read it and 's like the traffic that you see the amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells but we don 't know why anyone who tells you that we understand life walk away all of us to some extent study this thing called a bill gates you learn everything you can about that and then there 's another kind of thing that you might study and you study that hard that 's a bono this is a bono but then if you know everything you can know about those two things and you put them together what can you say about this combination the answer is not a lot and that 's complexity now imagine building that up to a city or to a society and you 've got obviously an and i 'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity that has the characteristic that it is so simple and so reliable that i can build things with it or i 'm going to use simple to mean reliable predictable and i 'm going to use as an example the internet because it 's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity we call it a complex system which it is but it 's also something else we are familiar with the arabic numbers one to ten and so on in binary one is one seven is one hundred and eleven the virtue of binary is that it 's the simplest possible way of representing numbers anything else is more complicated so it is very very simple once you learn how to read it and they can be on and off but our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up some fifty years ago which is a transistor but it does so without moving parts and it doesn 't fail basically for a very long period of time you can put lots of them together and you put lots of them together and you come with something called integrated circuits so that 's the next layer of simplicity and in fact integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they in general work really well you can build cellphones you all are accustomed to having your cellphones work the large majority of the time in boston boston is a little bit like namibia in its cell phone coverage so that we 're not accustomed to that all the time but some of the time you can now go to this nice lady and who is extremely happy with the fact that although she does not have an master 's degree in electrical engineering from mit she 's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone to get power in some funny way and from that comes the internet and this is a map of bitflows across the continent the two blobs that are in the middle there are the united states and europe and then back to simplicity again so here we have what i think is one of the great ideas which is google which in this simple portal but the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple in the sense that it is completely reliable let me then finish off with four the characteristics which i think are useful to think about for simple things they are predictable so simplicity and predictability are characteristics of simple things they 're cheap if you have things that are cheap enough people will find uses for them even if they seem very primitive you carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another and they support weight the function has to be predictable and the cost has to be low what that means is that you have to have a high performance or value for cost and then i would propose as this last component you can stack them people will find cheap functional reliable things unleash the creativity of people who then build stuff that the example is something that i want to give you from the work that we ourselves do we are very interested in delivering health care in the developing world and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis at as close to zero cost as we can manage so how does one do it wicks its way up into these little branches you know it turns colors in this particular case you 're reading since the health care worker of much of this part of the world is an eighteen year old with an who happens to be out of work and is willing to go around and do this sort of thing it will be stackable that is to say if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work it will be applicable to extendable in both vertical and horizontal directions part of my interest in this i have to say is that i would like to the capital structure of the u s health care system which i think is fundamentally broken but not simpler you have to have low cost but you also have to have a function you can 't make it too simple and the second is a design issue and it 's not directly relevant but it 's a nice statement this is by de saint exupery and he says you know you 've achieved perfection in design so what i think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity which doesn 't cover brancusi it doesn 't answer the question of why mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than van gogh and the world of people who think about things how do we make things as simple as we can as cheap as we can as functional as we can and as freely interconnectable as we can you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous of simplicity might get to the point where you could look out at various systems say a financial system or a legal system health that has got to the point of danger or dysfunctionality for the following reasons and this is how we might simplify it george whitesides yes you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis ca have you started to do that i mean with the health system you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side but in terms of the system itself that diagnostic technology that you 've got where is that and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale gw that 's coming out soon i mean the systems work and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind but the basic technology works ca you 've got a company set up to gw a foundation a foundation"
