  "transcript": "my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker and what this guy had done he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches and and as he did so his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving were words and he said to the guy why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see and the watchmaker turned around god can see it i felt something in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere i guess but and from that point on from my i began to ask myself the simple question do we actually think beauty and so i then moved on into my design career and to find some exciting things one of the most early work was done in automotive design some very exciting work was done there and during a lot of this work we found something or i found something that really fascinated me and maybe you can remember it do you remember when lights used to just go on and off click click when you closed the door in a car and then somebody i think it was bmw introduced a light that went out slowly i remember it clearly do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that and the first was i 'd ask other people do you like it and i suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that light to dark in six seconds exactly that do you know what it is anyone the slow bit of the brain using that and this isn 't a think it 's a feel and would you do me a favor for the next fourteen minutes or whatever it is you feel stuff i don 't need you to think so much as i want you to feel it i felt and that thing that i found was the cinema or the theater it 's actually just happened here light to dark that 's fantastic i 'm looking forward to it i get a sense of anticipation but it might be because the people i speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this and some of the people i speak to that have never seen a movie or been to so this leads me to think of this in a different way we 're not feeling it we 're thinking beauty is in the limbic system if that 's not an outmoded idea the wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit the cortex they arrive first so how do we make that actually work and how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know or what we 're going to learn about something this is one of the most beautiful things i know no there 's no beauty in that then i found out that this plastic bag if i put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff potable now i 'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit would you mind taking the brain out and i just want you to feel something what are you feeling about it is it beautiful is it exciting i 'm watching your faces very carefully there 's some rather bored looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged looking ladies this is the last act on this earth of a little girl called heidi five years old stop how do you feel where are you feeling this i 'm feeling it but and one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty something stupefyingly delicious is what i call the omg and by the way 's no pleasure in that face it 's not a this is wonderful the eyebrows are doing this the eyes are defocused and the mouth is hanging open that 's not the expression of joy there it means something triggering a big emotional often quite a sad emotional response but it 's part this is the paradox of beauty sensorily we 're taking in all sorts of things mixtures of things that are good bad exciting frightening to come up with that sensorial exposure that sensation of what 's going on pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl 's drawing this sense of transcendence this from a design point of view i get terribly excited about it because these are things as we 've already said they 're arriving at the brain it would seem before cognition before we can manipulate them electrochemical party tricks now what i 'm also interested in is is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty by that i mean intrinsically beautiful things just something that 's exquisitely beautiful that 's universally beautiful very hard to find something that to everybody is a very beautiful thing without a certain amount of information packed in there before so a lot of it tends to be extrinsic it 's mediated by information before the comprehension or the information 's added on at the back like that little girl 's drawing that i showed you now when talking about beauty you can 't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you and one of the most tedious saying that beauty was about symmetry well it obviously isn 't this is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people and then to add them into a list of most beautiful and they found that it was almost exact and tried to understand what the individual elements were but feeling it as i go now i can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if i look at that eye i and the earhole isn 't doing it to me at all so i don but it 's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off how i can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements anais nin and the talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are but as we are so i 'm going to shamelessly expose something to you which is beautiful to me because it 's a palimpsest of things it 's masses and masses of layers this is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension it 's something much bigger layer after layer of and i feel that here the big secret of automotive design reflection management it 's not about the shapes it 's how the shapes reflect light so it becomes a kinetic object even though it 's standing still this little relief on the footplate by the way to a rider means there 's something going on underneath it in this case a drive chain running at three hundred miles and hour probably taking the power from the engine i 'm getting titanium lacquer can 't tell you how wonderful this is because i know we need to bring the wheel and to cap it all brand royalty massimo tamburini they call him the plumber in italy as well as maestro because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time there 's so little compromise on this you can 't see it likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty and so look at her i 've had no one 's noticed have they yet did you see what i did but then it 's that easy to lose beauty because beauty 's incredibly difficult to do and only a few people can do it and a focus group this is pretty close to intrinsic beauty this one as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this it 's lovely because it is an embodiment of it 's stupefyingly difficult to make something that refracts light like that that comes out of the tool correctly that goes down the line without falling over underneath this like the story of the swan is a million things very difficult it 's a fantastic and they 're working while she 's doing these graceful arabesques the comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what 's actually going on but what i have to do now feeling again what i 've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes of these triggers into something early on in the process that you pick it up not through your thinking but through your feeling so we 're going to have a little experiment right are you ready i 'm going to show you something for a very very brief moment are you ready it 's not tell me something did you think it was quick when you first saw it yes you did did you think it was modern yes you did that and the great thing is this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it 's green technology and it 's good for you and it 's light and it 's all part of the future well in this case it isn 't because it 's a very very of technology but you 're a slave of that first flash we are slaves to the first few fractions of a second and that 's where much of my work has to win or lose on a shelf in a shop but i have to work within that domain to ensure that it gets you there what 's about this and the way i love to come back to it is this is taking something that you hate or bores you folding clothes and if you can actually do this who can actually do this anybody try to do this yeah it look at that do you want to see it again no time it says i have two minutes left so we can 't do this it feels fantastic when you do it you look forward to doing it and when you tell somebody else about it like you probably have you look really smart the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside the stuff that costs nothing because that knowledge is free only sometimes form is function form is function it informs it tells us it supplies us answers before we 've even thought about it and so i 've stopped using words like form and i 've stopped using words like function as a designer what i try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things because if i can get that i can make them wonderful and i can make them repeatedly wonderful and you know what those products and services are because you own some of them they forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it thank you"
