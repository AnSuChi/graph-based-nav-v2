  "transcript": "working with i have asked her to translate for me england but i 'm not going to say it in english to you because i 'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent mandarin is i can only speak this paragraph which i have learned by heart when i was visiting in china so all i can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won 't notice i would like to apologize to any mandarin speakers in the audience as because i didn 't think it was very cool it felt a bit girly to me like a baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down my dad never wore it so i didn 't see why i had to it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable that people assume i represent something genuinely indian when i wear it because that 's not how i feel the only way i feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like li mu bai from that film okay is about identity and language challenging common assumptions based on how we look like or where we what makes us who we are anyway like water it becomes the cup now water can i have been wondering recently if he were alive today what advice he would give me about making this ted talk i still think that we learn who we are by copying others who here hasn 't imitated their childhood hero in the playground or mum or father i have hp a few years ago in order to make this i shaved off all my hair so that i could grow it back as my father had it i even started to get discounts in indian shops but then very quickly i started to underestimate my mustache growing ability and instead people from across the road they would shout things like even have an indian accent anymore he talks like this now and so i wrote about this and had it i learned this by heart like music i guess yr so i can pretend i speak chinese fluently when i i spoke the phrase and then he that 's great only it kind of sounds like a woman so this imitation business does come with risk it doesn 't always go as you plan it even with a talented translator but i am going to stick with it because so i become more like myself i become more authentically me this is my art i i strive for authenticity even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect it 's only recently that i 've started to understand that i didn 't learn to sit like this through being indian i learned this"
