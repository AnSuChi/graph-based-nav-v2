  "transcript": "now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology think and this outer layer this is the vasculature which is incredible twenty percent of the blood pumped from your heart is servicing this one organ that 's basically if you hold two fists together it 's just slightly larger than the two fists so for example they can see in the back part of the brain which is just turning around there there 's the cerebellum that 's keeping you upright right now it 's keeping me standing it 's involved in coordinated movement on the side here this is temporal cortex this is the area where primary auditory processing so you 're hearing my words you 're sending it up into higher language processing centers towards the front of the brain is the place in which all so if you take a deeper look at the brain one of the things if you look at it in cross section what you can see is that so about a hundred years ago some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells and that 's shown here in the the very light blue you can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained and what you can see is it 's very non uniform you see a lot more structure there but you can also see things underneath there as well eighty six billion neurons in our brain and as you can see they since we can now start to map brain function we can start to tie these into the individual cells so let 's so as i mentioned there are eighty six billion neurons there are also these smaller cells as you 'll see these are support cells astrocytes glia each neuron is connected via synapses to up to ten thousand other neurons in your brain and each neuron itself is largely unique the unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying they 're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with they 're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do so if we zoom in to an even deeper level we each have twenty three pairs of chromosomes we get one from mom one from dad and on these chromosomes are roughly twenty five thousand genes they 're encoded in the dna and thousand genes are turned on so we sent our lab technician out we are seeking normal human brains there 's a lot of criteria by which we 're selecting these brains we want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of twenty to sixty they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain no drugs on board we do a toxicology workup and we 're very careful about the brains that we do take we 're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue we can get consent to take the tissue because what we 're trying to measure the rna which is the readout from our genes is very labile and so so we have to move very because of the way that we collect and because we require consent we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains males are much more likely to and men are much more likely to have their significant other so the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what 's called an mr this is magnetic resonance imaging it 's a standard template by which we 're going to hang the rest of this data so we collect this mr and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map the next thing we do is we collect what 's called a diffusion tensor imaging this maps the large cabling in the brain and again you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways if you will we take these this is a whole human hemisphere and we put them into what 's basically a glorified meat slicer there 's a blade here that 's going to cut across a section of and we scan it and then what we get is our so this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments you could consider this state boundaries if you will those pretty broad outlines from this we 're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces this is twenty microns thin so this is about a baby hair 's width and remember it 's frozen and so this will then go onto a robot that 's going to apply one of those stains to it and our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this so again this is what they can see under the microscope you can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places and from there it 's routine they understand where to make these assignments and they can make basically what 's a reference atlas this is a more detailed map and then the laser actually cuts we purify the rna out of it using some basic technology we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray now this may look like a bunch of dots to you but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human that we spotted down on glass this has roughly sixty thousand elements on it so we repeatedly measure various genes of the twenty five thousand genes in the genome and when we take a quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample now we do this over and over again this process for any given brain we 're taking over a thousand samples for so each sample gets us about fifty thousand data points we 've done right now two human brains worth of data we 've put all of that together into one thing and i 'll show you what that synthesis looks like it 's basically a large data set of information that 's all freely available to any scientist around the world they don 't even mine this data find interesting things out with this so here 's the modalities that we put together you 'll start to recognize these things from what we 've collected before it allows you to highlight individual structures we 're now mapping into this anatomic framework which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on so the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree green is the sort of cool areas where it 's not turned on and each gene gives us a fingerprint and remember that we 've assayed all the twenty five thousand genes in the genome and have all of that data available we 're just starting to to look at this data ourselves there 's some basic things that you would want to understand two great prozac and wellbutrin these are commonly prescribed antidepressants now remember we 're assaying genes genes send the instructions to make proteins proteins are so if you want to understand the action of drugs you want to understand how they 're acting in the ways you want them to and also in the ways you don 't want them to in the side effect profile etc you want to see where those genes are turned on and for the first time can actually do that we can do that in multiple individuals that we 've assayed too so now we can look and we get confirmation we get confirmation that indeed the gene is turned on for something like prozac in serotonergic structures things that are already known be affected but we also get to see the whole thing we also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before and we see these genes turned on there as interesting a side effect as it could be we can actually scan through the entire genome and find so if you 're in drug discovery for example you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and most of you are probably familiar with genome wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect x and so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they 're great they analyze large populations they look at their entire genomes and they try to find hot spots of activity and so it 's very important for so i think this we all have different but the fact is our genomes are greater than ninety nine percent similar we 're similar at the genetic and so this shows it 's not ninety nine percent but it 's roughly ninety percent correspondence so i think these are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type these are two genes that we found as good examples one is called reln it 's involved in early developmental cues disc1 is a gene that 's deleted in schizophrenia these aren 't schizophrenic individuals and so what you 're looking at here in donor one and donor four which are the exceptions to the other two that genes so i 'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go i think these resources are incredibly valuable they give researchers a handle on where to go but we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point we 're certainly going to be looking at more i 'll and this is truly an unexplored undiscovered continent this is the the new frontier if you will and so for those who are undaunted but humbled by the complexity of the brain the future awaits"
