  "transcript": "there are things we say when we catch the eye of a stranger or a neighbor walking by we say hello how are you it 's a beautiful day how do you feel these sound kind of meaningless right and in some ways they are they have no semantic meaning it i make eye contact i get all kinds of stories what i found was that something really beautiful was going on this is almost poetic they were unexpected pleasures i 'm a new yorker so that means i was actually standing in the street on the storm drain and and he says to me don 't stand there you might disappear and zoop you 're gone and he was so happy that he 'd saved me we had this little bond for a minute i felt like my existence as a person had been noticed the really sad thing is in many parts of the world we 're raised to believe that strangers are dangerous by default but most we don 't know what their intentions are we rely on this category of stranger she it 's just good to be friendly i think twice every time i say that to her because i mean it but as a woman particularly i know that not every stranger on the street has the best intentions and it 's good to learn when not to be but none of that means we have to be afraid the first one is that it liberates us when you think about it using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done categories are something our brains use when it comes to people it 's sort of a white stranger friend and we use the information in that box it 's it 's easy and it 's a road to bias and it means we 're not thinking about people she 's entering into towns and cities she 's a foreigner her survival strategy is this get one stranger to see you as a real individual person if you can do that it 'll help other people see you that way i know it sounds a little counterintuitive intimacy and strangers but these quick interactions can lead to a feeling that sociologists call fleeting intimacy so it 's a brief experience that has emotional it 's the good feeling i got from being saved from the death trap of the storm drain by the old man researchers have found that people often feel more comfortable being honest and open about their inner selves with strangers than they do with their friends and their families this gets reported in the media with great lament strangers communicate better than spouses the important thing about these studies is just how significant these interactions can be how this special form of closeness the first one is that it 's a quick interaction the second reason is where it gets more interesting we have a bias when it comes to people we 're close to and you can 't believe that your friend or your spouse isn 't picking up on it that you want to leave early you 're thinking i gave you the look we spell out all the inside jokes and guess what sometimes they do understand us a little better there are unwritten rules we tend to follow the rules are very different depending on what country you 're in what culture you 're in the baseline expectation in public is that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy this is known as civil inattention so imagine two people are walking towards each other on the street they the acknowledgment and then as they get closer they 'll look away to give each other some space in other cultures people go to extraordinary lengths not to interact at all people from denmark tell me that many danes are so averse to talking to strangers that they would rather miss their stop on the bus than say excuse me to someone that they need to get around instead there 's this elaborate shuffling of bags and using your body to say that you need to get past instead of using two words in egypt i 'm told it 's rude to ignore a stranger and there 's a remarkable culture of hospitality strangers might ask each other for a sip of water we see these unwritten rules most clearly when they 're broken or when you 're in a new place and you 're trying to figure out what the right thing to do is sometimes breaking the rules a little bit is where the action is another is there 's some third thing that you both might see and comment on like a piece of public art or somebody preaching in the street another is what i call noticing this is usually giving a compliment i 'm actually not wearing fabulous shoes right now but shoes are fabulous in general and they 're pretty neutral as far as giving compliments goes people always want to tell you things about their awesome shoes you may have already experienced the dogs and babies principle it can be awkward to talk to someone on the street you don 't know how they 're going to respond but you can always talk to their dog or their baby and you can tell by how they respond whether they 're open to talking more the last one i want to challenge you to is disclosure so next time you 're talking to a stranger and you feel comfortable tell them something true about yourself something really personal you might have that experience i talked about of feeling understood sometimes in conversation it comes up people ask me what does your dad do or where does he live and sometimes i tell them the whole truth which is that he died when i was a kid always in those moments so here it is when you talk to strangers you 're making beautiful interruptions into the expected narrative of your daily life if you don 't talk to strangers you 're missing out on all of that we spend a lot of time teaching our children about strangers we could reject all the ideas that make us so suspicious of each other thank you"
