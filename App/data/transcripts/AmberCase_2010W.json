  "transcript": "like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs so what 's a good definition for cyborg traditional definition is an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments somebody goes to another country what 's happening is that we 've suddenly found a new species i as a cyborg anthropologist have suddenly said oh wow now suddenly we 're a new of homo sapiens and look at these fascinating cultures and look at these curious rituals that everybody 's doing around around this technology they 're clicking on things and staring at screens in the beginning for thousands and thousands of years everything has been a physical modification of self it has helped us to extend our physical selves go faster and the other thing that happens is that we 're all carrying around little mary poppins technology we can put anything we want and then we can take anything out what does the inside of your computer actually look like well if you print it out it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you 're carrying around all the time and if you it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind that you suddenly feel like something 's missing except you aren 't able to see it so it feels like a very strange emotion whether you like it or not you 're starting to show up online and people are interacting with your second self when you 're not and so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open which is basically your facebook wall so that people don 't write on it in the middle of the night because it 's very much the equivalent and suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self you have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life so in the same way that you wake up take a shower and get dressed you have to learn to do that for your digital self and the problem is that a lot of people now especially adolescents have to go through two adolescences they have and that 's even more awkward because there 's an actual and so it 's very awkward and it 's very difficult for them to do those things so when i was little my dad would sit me down at night and he would say i 'm going to teach you about time and space in the future and i said great and he said one day what 's the shortest distance between two points and i said well that 's a straight line you told me that yesterday i thought i was very clever and he said that is the shortest distance between two points and i said and that 's just how you do it and i said i want to do that and he said well okay and so when i went to sleep for the next i was thinking at night i want to be the first person to create a wormhole to make things accelerate faster and i want to make a time machine i was always sending messages to my future self but then what i realized when i went to college is that technology doesn 't just get adopted because they weren 't physically transporting and i thought oh wow i found it this is great so over time time and space have have compressed because of this you can stand on one side of the world whisper something and be heard on the other one of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use every single browser tab gives you a different type of and that incites a sort of panic architecture oh no where 's this thing and so what happens is when we bring all that into the social space we end up checking our phones all the time so we have this thing called ambient intimacy it 's not that we 're always and if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone the room would be very crowded these are the people that you have access to right now in general all of these people all of your friends and family that you can connect to and that they aren 't slowing down and stopping and really when you have no external input instead of just dealing with everything and so this is very important i 'm really worried that especially kids today they 're not going to be and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it so if you think about it the world hasn 't stopped but when you actually visualize it all the connections that we 're doing right now this is an image of the mapping of the internet it doesn 't look technological it actually looks very organic this is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we 've connected in this way and it 's not that machines are taking over it 's that they 're helping us to be more human helping us to connect with each other it ends up being more human than technology because we 're co creating each other all the time and so this is this is the important point that i like to study that things are beautiful that it 's still a human connection thank you"
