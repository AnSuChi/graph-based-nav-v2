  "transcript": "the way i feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what i wanted to say and it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness but maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all i could share with you a little story about myself onward i was given the clothes that i needed to wear and told where i needed to be given these very precious and holy looking robes to wear with the understanding that it was something sacred or important but before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me and when i was seven years old all of a sudden a search party arrived at my home they were looking the next and your lifestyle completely changed and what i mostly say is that at that time it was a pretty interesting idea to me i thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with but it didn 't turn out to be so fun and entertaining as i thought it would have been i was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment lot of different responsibilities in terms of my education and so forth were heaped upon me i didn 't have have many personal friends to spend time with but i was expected to perform these so it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the karmapa wasn 't going to come true it more and i was to sit in one place like a statue would i felt that even though i 've been separated from my loved ones and of course now when i was fourteen i escaped from tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father my relatives my friends and my homeland there 's no real sense of separation from me in my heart in terms of the love that i feel for these people i feel still a very strong connection of love for all of these people and for the land and i still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father albeit infrequently i talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone and my experience is that when i 'm talking to her with every second that passes during our conversation the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together so those were just a few remarks about my personal background and in terms of other things that i wanted to share with you in terms of ideas i think it 's and i think that 's symbolic of what we 're seeing in the world in general that the world is becoming smaller and smaller and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection that 's wonderful but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside along with outward development and increase of opportunity so we spoke and we heard some about design this week i think that it 's important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward on the endeavor of the design of the heart we heard a lot about technology this week and it 's important for us to remember to invest a lot of our energy in improving the technology of the heart still i feel a sense of impediment when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart to heart or a mind to mind level i feel that there are some things that are getting in the way is an interesting one because as a spiritual leader i 'm always attempting to open my heart to others and because being someone in a position like mine but i had and we had a really interesting conversation which as you know were destroyed some years ago in afghanistan but the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry you don 't find as many physical representations of divinity or of spiritual liberation as you do in the buddhist tradition where of course there are many statues of the buddha that are so we were talking about the differences between the traditions and but i offered the suggestion that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way what we saw in the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas was the depletion of matter some solid substance falling down and disintegrating maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the berlin wall so i think that in this way it possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better i really feel that the development that we make shouldn 't create a further burden for us as human beings but should be used to improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we but at the same time i think as some of us have acknowledged acknowledged we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand so as we are climbing the tree some of the things that we 're doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree 's very root and so what i think it comes down to is a question of not only having information of what 's going on but paying attention to that and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive this week about the horrible sufferings for example that so many women of the world are enduring day to day we have that information but what often happens to us is that we don 't really choose to pay attention to it we don 't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts so i think the way forward for the world one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with the real root of happiness is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart and i think that means sinking in to whatever it is you 're doing now whatever sink into that get a full taste of that we 've taken millions of breaths collectively we haven 't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives but and i think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us but that if we pay attention we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take every one of you who has come here is so talented and you have so much to offer to the world i think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good and we will spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world and i was somewhat resistant and i was also i would tell them it 's because i have to talk tomorrow and but i very much appreciate the opportunity she 's given me to be here"
