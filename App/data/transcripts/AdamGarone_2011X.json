  "transcript": "ladies and gentlemen and more importantly mo bros and mo sistas for we 're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world through that process that i inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place is how did this come about how did movember and beyond that a foundation to support pretty much in every case that 's how a charity starts not so with movember and i was watching the world go by had a few more beers and the conversation turned to ' 70s fashion and a few more beers i said there has to be some stuff that hasn 't come back back why hasn 't that made a comeback so then there was a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in australia mo and they are start the month and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache themed party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst now trust me when you 're growing a mustache back in two thousand and three and there were thirty of us back then and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn 't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who 's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would shuffle kids away from us and we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer and and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer which is changing the face of men 's health and that eloquently describes the challenge changing your appearance for the thirty days and also the outcome that having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face the ceo of the prostate cancer foundation i said to him i 've got the most amazing idea that 's going to transform your organization and funds for his organization and i needed a partnership to legitimately do that and we 're going to change the face of men 's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he we can 't have anything to do with you so i paid for coffee that day and his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we 'll gladly take it and we got four hundred and fifty every day this morning i wake up and go my life is about a mustache so in two thousand and five the campaign and then in two thousand and six we came to a pivotal point it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that i could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it 's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you that there 's not too many people interested in who we 'd raised about one point two million dollars for at that stage and foster 's brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever and leading into movember two thousand and six we 'd run through all whatnot to delay their billing until december so we 'd racked up at this stage about six hundred thousand dollars worth of we would 've been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches so what we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early two thousand and seven a really interesting thing happened we had mo bros from from canada from the u s and from the u k emailing us and and i said to him i have this most amazing concept it 's going to transform your organization and i said vision of getting men growing mustaches all across canada raising awareness and funds for your organization sounds like a really novel idea but we 're an ultraconservative organization but we 're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country the u s and the u k and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure and we 're not about finding an australian cure or a canadian we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage for the campaign it wasn 't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung ho with our success in australia so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets last year we had four hundred and fifty thousand mo bros spread across the world and together we raised and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches laughter and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon our ambassadors are the mo bros and and i always get asked by the media down there because and that is so so important and fundamental to our success now what i want share with you is one of my most touching and it happened here in toronto last year at the end of the campaign but i said you know what i think we 've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a but this is for breast cancer and i said because we couldn 't afford proper treatment for her and he said and i didn 't tell him who i was because i didn 't think it was appropriate and i just shook his hand and i said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke and being significant in their own life survivor support programs and research now we always focus naturally on how much we raise because it 's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because i know that is changing and saving lives today and it 's probably best exampled by a young guy that i met at south by southwest in austin texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of i had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer and i learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and he hadn 't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise and research and how we 're redefining research we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there 's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions let alone nationally let alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is cancer research the world over so what we did was we created a global action plan and we 're taking ten percent of what 's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund and so they identified that as a priority and then they 've got and recruited now three hundred researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially so now we 're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and that 's how we 're redefining the research world what i know about my movember journey is that with a really creative idea and a lot of patience and that city is melbourne my and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men 's health"
