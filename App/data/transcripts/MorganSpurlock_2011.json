  "transcript": "i have spent the past few years i went to prison worked in a coal mine and i spent thirty days eating nothing but this fun in the beginning little difficult in the middle very dangerous in the end in fact most of my career i 've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my two thousand and eleven ted talk that 's right some lucky individual corporation was going to get the once in a lifetime opportunity because i 'm sure chris anderson will never let it happen again to buy the naming rights to the talk you 're watching right now so what you were getting was this your name here presents my ted talk it 's a very good media opportunity you know how many people watch these ted talks it that 's just a working title by the way so but in the new and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years but nothing could prepare me nothing could ready me for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these you see i had this idea for a movie morgan spurlock so the movie will be called the greatest movie ever sold so what happens in the greatest movie ever sold is that everything from top to bottom from start to finish is branded from we going to have the brand x title sponsor the greatest car you ever drove from the greatest movie ever sold the greatest drink you 've ever had courtesy of the greatest movie ever sold xavier kochhar so the idea is beyond just showing you 're going to see the whole thing take place in and i would love for ceg to help it happen robert friedman you know it 's funny because when i first hear it it is the ultimate respect for an audience guy i don 't know how receptive people are going to be to it though xk do you have a perspective i don 't want to use angle because that has a negative connotation but do you know how this is going to play out have a hard time meeting with them but i think it 's certainly worth maybe by the time your film comes out we look like a bunch of blithering idiots ms what do you think the when you look at the people you deal with mk we 've got some places we can go we want nothing to do with your movie they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project and i was blown away because i thought the whole concept the idea of advertising was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible to get as many people to see it as possible especially in today 's world this of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape isn 't the idea to get that new buzz worthy delivery vehicle that 's going to get that message to the masses but the problem was you see my idea had one fatal flaw and that flaw was this actually no that was not the flaw whatsoever that wouldn 't have been a problem at all this would have been fine but what this image represents was the problem see when you do a google image search for transparency this is this is one of the first images that comes up so i like the way you roll sergey brin was the problem transparency you see we hear a lot about transparency these days our politicians say but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality something suddenly changes but why eating an entire bowl of cool whip that 's now when i started talking to companies we want you to tell a but we just want to tell our story see when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie and there he is giving me the look he often gave me there 's my story and there 's the real you see with this film we wanted to tell the real story but with only one company one agency willing to help me and that 's only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years i realized that i would have to go on my own i 'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies so what you suddenly started to realize or what i started to realize is that when you started having conversations with these companies the idea of understanding your brand is a i have friends who make great big giant hollywood films and i have friends who make little independent films like i make and the friends of mine who make big giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have and then my friends who make small independent films say well how are we supposed to compete with these big giant hollywood movies and the movie is called i open up my medicine cabinet you will see while anytime i do an interview with someone i can say are you fresh enough for this interview are you ready you look a little nervous i want to help you calm down so we will have have them geared for both male or female that 's the so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the five cent tour karen frank we are a smaller brand much like you talked about being a smaller we 're very much a challenger brand so we don 't have the budgets that other brands have so doing things like this you know remind people about ban is kind of why were interested in it ms what are is a great word that really spins this category into the positive versus fights odor three times fresher things like that that are what about me what about a regular guy i need to go talk to the man on the street the people who are like me the regular joes they need to tell me about my brand style i am would be like i like a lot of black colors a lot of grays and stuff like that but usually i have an accessory like sunglasses or he might be a classic convertible mercedes benz man two the brand that i am is i would call it i sell pet toys all over the country all over the world so i guess that 's my brand warped little industry that 's my brand man four my brand is fedex because i deliver the goods man five failed writer alcoholic brand is that something lawyer i 'm a lawyer brand tom i 'm but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly and what i realized is i needed an expert i needed somebody who could get inside my head somebody who could really help me understand what they call your brand personality and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg they 've helped companies like nestle febreze hallmark discover that brand personality if they could do it for them surely they could do it for me a so tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ms these are the people who shape the way i look at the world a tell me about this world ms this world i think your world is the world that you live in like people who are around you your friends your family the way you live your life the job you do all those things stemmed and started from one place and for me they stemmed and started with my family in west virginia i like things that are weird i like weird things a tell me about the why phase what does that do for us what is the machete what pupa stage are you in now why is it important to reboot what does those are most what other brands are like that mini from the mini coopers and jetblue now there 's playful brands and mindful brands those things that have come and gone but a playful mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing ms are you something that gets the blood flowing or are you more of a down attribute are you something that 's a little more calm reserved conservative up attributes are things like being playful magical or mystical like gandalf or are you mindful sophisticated like seven are you established contemplative or wise like the dalai lama or yoda we had companies who were up and down companies saying no they didn 't want any part of this project they wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they would have no control they would have no control over the final but we did get seventeen brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn 't be able to tell they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they 're using mri 's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing went to san paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising in the entire city for the past five years there 's no billboards there 's no posters there 's no flyers nothing and we went to school districts what 's incredible for me is the projects that i 've gotten the most i 'm going to deal directly with the artist i 'm going to work with him to create something different something that 's going to get people thinking that 's going to challenge the way we look at the world and how has that been for them has it been successful well since the film premiered at the sundance film festival let 's take a look according to burrelles the movie premiered in january and since then and this isn 't even the whole thing we 've had so ultimately this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part what i always believe i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare we 've got to put that bear in a cage embrace fear embrace risk one big spoonful at a time we have to embrace risk and ultimately we have to embrace transparency ever a little honesty is going to go a long way and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency has been brought to you by my good friends who for $ seven thousand one hundred bought the naming rights on ebay turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world i have in my pocket to be applied toward my attendance for next year 's"
