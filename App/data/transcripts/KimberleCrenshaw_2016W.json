  "transcript": "please stand up ok so i 'm going to name some names i 'd like you to take a seat the last person standing we 're going to see what they know so let 's continue and actually i 'm not going to put you on the spot i just say that to encourage transparency so you can be seated of you who recognized the first group of names know that these were been killed by the police over the last two and a half years what you may not know is that the other list is also who have been killed within the only one thing distinguishes the names that you know i 've done it to women 's rights organizations i 've done it even with progressive members of congress and everywhere the awareness of the level of police violence that black women experience is exceedingly low would be the case i mean there are two issues involved here there 's police violence against when we think about who is victimized by these problems the names of these black women never come to mind communications experts tell us that when facts do not fit with the available frames people have a difficult time incorporating new facts into their way of thinking about a problem no frames for us to remember them now you might ask why does a frame matter black people and an issue that affects women wouldn 't that necessarily include black people who are women and women who are black people the simple answer is that this is a trickle down approach to social justice and many times without frames that allow us to see how social problems impact all the members of a targeted group many will fall through the cracks of our movements left to suffer in virtual isolation but it to be this way many years ago i began to use the term intersectionality to deal with the fact that many of our social justice problems like racism and sexism are often overlapping creating multiple levels of social injustice the experience that gave rise to intersectionality was my chance encounter with a woman named emma degraffenreid i actually read about emma 's story from the pages of a legal opinion written by a judge who had dismissed emma 's claim of race and gender discrimination against a local car manufacturing plant emma like so many women sought better employment for her family and for others she wanted to create a better life for her children and for her family and she was not hired and she believed that she was not hired because she was a black woman and the argument for dismissing the suit was that the employer did hire employer hired women the real problem though that the judge was not willing to acknowledge was what emma was actually trying to say that the usually for industrial jobs maintenance jobs were all men and the only if the court was able to see how these policies came together would he be able to see the double discrimination that emma degraffenreid was facing but the court refused to allow emma to put two causes of action together to tell her story because he believed that by allowing her to do that she would be able to have preferential treatment she would have an advantage by having two swings at the bat african american men and white women only had one swing at the bat but of men or white women needed to combine a race and gender discrimination claim to tell the story of the discrimination they were experiencing why wasn 't the real unfairness law 's refusal to protect women simply because their experiences weren 't exactly the same as white women and men rather than broadening the frame to include african american women the court simply tossed their case completely out of court now as a student of antidiscrimination law as a feminist as an antiracist i was struck by this case it felt to me like second of all the court doubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential and to boot you can 't see a problem and when you can 't see a problem you pretty much can 't solve it i had come to recognize that the problem and it was distorting the challenge that i faced was trying to figure out whether there was an alternative narrative a prism that would allow us to see emma 's dilemma a prism that would allow us to rescue her from the cracks in the law that would allow judges to see her story a simple analogy to an intersection so if we think about this intersection the roads to the intersection would be the way that the workforce was structured by race and by gender and then the traffic in those roads would be the hiring and the other practices that ran through those roads now because emma was both black and female she was positioned precisely where those roads overlapped experiencing the simultaneous impact of the company 's gender and race traffic the law the law is like that ambulance that shows up so what do you call being impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for yourself intersectionality i would go on to learn that women like other women of color like other socially marginalized people all over the world were facing all kinds of dilemmas and challenges as a consequence of all of these social dynamics come together but in the same way that intersectionality raised our awareness to the way that black women live their lives it also exposes the tragic circumstances under which women die police violence against black women the level of violence that black women face is such that it 's not surprising that some of them do not survive their encounters with police great grandmothers as old as they 've been killed in their living rooms they 've been killed in front of their parents been killed they 've been killed when they 've called they 've even been killed they 've been killed sitting in a car reported as stolen is it that their lost lives don 't generate the same amount of media attention and communal outcry as the lost lives of their fallen brothers so what can we do in two thousand and fourteen the african american policy forum began to demand that we say her name at rallies at protests at meetings but saying her name is is not enough we have to be willing to do more we have to be willing to bear witness to bear the everyday violence and humiliation that many bearing in mind that some of the images that i 'm about to share with you may be triggering for some to collectively bear witness to some of this violence we and as we sit with these women some who have experienced violence and we have an opportunity to reverse what happened at the beginning of this talk when we could not stand for these women because we did not know their names so at the end of this clip there 's going to be a roll call several black women 's names will come up disorderly let 's create a cacophony of sound to represent our intention to hold these women up to sit to bring them into the light but the time now is to move from mourning and grief to action and transformation thank you for joining us"
