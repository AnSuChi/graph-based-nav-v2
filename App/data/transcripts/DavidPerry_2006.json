  "transcript": "mid summer i couldn 't pick a career in ireland the obvious choice is the military but to be honest it actually kind of sucks my mother wanted me to be a dentist but the problem was that people kept blowing everything up so i actually went to school in belfast which was where all the action happened the school i went to was pretty boring they forced us to learn things like latin the school teachers weren 't having much fun the sports were very dirty or very i cleverly chose rowing which i got very good at and i was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day and i flipped over right in front of the entire school and that was the finishing post right there so this was extremely embarrassing but our school at that time got a grant from the government and they got an incredible computer the research machine 3dz and they left the programming manuals lying around and so students like myself with nothing to do and you 'd buy your programs on cassette tape actually so i brought a picture with big hair zx80 came along the very cleverly named sinclair we were programming in basic a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing battlestar galactica the graphics were just horrible you had to have an even better imagination to play this game death rider it was around this time we went from and if you 're wondering how much 16k is this ebay logo here and that 's what it looked like i spent ages flying this flight simulator and i honestly believed i could fly airplanes by the end of it here 's clive sinclair now launching his color computer he 's recognized as being the father of video so i went on for the next twenty years or so making a lot of different games some of the highlights were things like the terminator aladdin the teenage mutant hero turtles because i was from the united kingdom they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children so they decided to call the last game i did was based on trying to get the video game industry and hollywood to actually work together on something instead of licensing from each other to actually work now chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me so i 've done that the video game industry in two thousand and five billion dollar business it grows every year last year was the biggest year by two thousand and eight we 're going to kick the butt of the music industry by two thousand and ten we 're going to hit forty two billion forty three percent of gamers are female so there 's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware the average age of gamers well obviously it 's for children right well no actually it 's thirty years old and interestingly the people who buy the most games are is our target audience so it 's just not true online gaming statistics it costs fifty bucks just to install it on your computer making the publisher about another two hundred and seventy five million the game costs about eighty million dollars to basically it pays for itself in about a month a player in a game called project entropia this purchase included mining and hunting rights ownership of all land on the island and a castle with this market is now estimated at over eight hundred million dollars annually they found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games i dove onto ebay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on typed in world of warcraft got six thousand items i liked this one the best a level sixty warlock with lots of epics for one hundred and it turns out they 're actually in hollywood bowl in los angeles listening to the l a philharmonic playing video game music that 's what the show looks like you would expect it to be cheesy but it 's not it 's very very epic and a very beautiful concert and the people that went there absolutely loved it what do you think these people are doing they 're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other and this is happening in every city around the world this is happening in your local cities too you 're probably just not aware of it now chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics but what i want you to do is to try to understand it we 're on this curve and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better but i want you to try and think about what games could look like ten years from now so we 're going to start that video video throughout human history people have played games as man 's intellect and technology have evolved so too this is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today you need to be really an incredible artist and once we get enough of those guys we 're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we 've never been to before or characters that we 've just never seen before but if you were to go to a game developers conference what they 're all talking about is emotion purpose meaning understanding and feeling you 'll hear about talks like can a video game make you cry and these are the kind of topics we really actually care about i came across a student who 's absolutely excellent at expressing himself and this student agreed that he would so this is a student 's opinion on what his experience of games are video i like many of you live somewhere between reality and video games part of me a true living breathing person has become programmed electronic and virtual i 'm a video game addict and this is my story the year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development i spent a lot of time in front of the tv and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me when my parents bought my sister and i our first nintendo whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me my virtual reality or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level it is because i have had life altering experiences in virtual space and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not i still crave more from an early age i learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen today after twenty years of watching tv geared to make me emotional i am just one of a new generation that is growing up a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres or the news we watch on tv what i do learn applies to my real life i know i can unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it video games actually allow us to become part of the machine they allow us to sublimate into the culture of we are interacting with our entertainment i have come to expect this level of interaction disease and genocide lack the levity they should their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time tv but the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional i have fought in wars feared for my own survival watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any excited panicked proud these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create a well designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience i know what i want and i do it no buttons to push no triggers to pull just me and the game my fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game these are all troubles outside of myself i however have a problem very close to home something has happened to my brain perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts the things we know to do before we even think while some of these instincts may be innate most are learned and all of them are hardwired into our brains these instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli only virtually consider this my real life car has about twenty five thousand miles on it in all my driving games i 've driven a total of thirty one thousand four hundred and fifty nine miles to some degree i 've learned how to drive from the game the sensory cues are very similar it 's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the tv than you have when i am driving down a road at sunset all i can think is this is almost as beautiful as my games are i 'm not sure what the implications of my experience are but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me today i believe big brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re programming but maybe brainwashing isn 't always bad imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other or helps us to understand the problems we 're all facing in the real world there is a potential to do good as well it is critical as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them i 'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization but as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way i do what i have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics sound game play and emotion i know that i am losing my grip i know though that no matter how amazing video games may become or how flat the real world may seem to us that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug dp wow i found that video very very thought provoking and that 's why i wanted to bring it here for you guys to see and what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio but as you heard michael talked about all these other elements as well the name of this track is the magic to come who is that going to come from is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would i don 't think so i think it 's going to come from the children who are growing up now that aren 't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past they 're going to do it their way the tools that we 've created the same with students or highly creative people writers and people like that as far as colleges go there 's about three hundred and fifty colleges around the world teaching video game courses that means there 's literally thousands of new ideas some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great there 's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and the school is closed they 're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video game ideas i 'm sitting at the front of the class and they 're actually pitching their ideas so it 's hard to get students to come back to class but it is possible this is my daughter her name 's emma she 's seventeen months old and you know and as the student i just hope she likes video games so my closing thought games on the surface seem simple entertainment but for those that like to look a little deeper the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers to creative minds that like to think big where better to challenge those minds than here at ted thank you"
