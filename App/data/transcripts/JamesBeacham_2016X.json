  "transcript": "there is something about physics that has been and it 's related to a question that scientists have been asking for almost one hundred years with no answer how do the smallest things in nature the particles of the quantum world match up with the largest things in nature planets and stars and galaxies held together by gravity as a kid i would puzzle over questions just like this i would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets and i would read about the forces of the small and about quantum mechanics and i would marvel at how well that description matched up to our observation then i would look at the stars and i would read about how well we understand gravity and i would think surely there must be some elegant way that these two systems match up but there 's not everything breaks and to little old me little curious skeptical james this was a supremely unsatisfying answer so i 'm still a skeptical little when i found myself smack in the middle of the physics world being flipped on its head it all started when we at cern saw something intriguing in our data a hint of a new particle an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question i am a physicist at cern 's large hadron collider the largest science experiment ever mounted it and in this tunnel we use superconducting magnets colder than outer space collecting the debris of these collisions to search for new undiscovered fundamental particles and in the summer of two thousand and fifteen we had been working tirelessly to switch on the lhc at the highest energy that humans have ever used in a collider experiment higher energy is important because for particles there is an equivalence between energy and particle mass and mass is just a number put there by nature and we collect this data very slowly over months and months and then new particles might show up in our data as bumps slight deviations from what you expect little clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth for example this bump led to the discovery of the higgs particle the higgs boson and to a nobel prize for the for the confirmation of its existence this jump up in energy in two thousand and fifteen represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had of discovering new particles new answers to these long standing questions because it was almost twice as much energy as we used when we discovered the higgs boson many of my colleagues had been working their entire so june and fifteen the lhc is switched back on and then finally we saw the first proton collisions at this highest energy ever applause champagne celebration this was a milestone and then a few weeks later we found a bump but it was big enough to make you raise your eyebrow but on a scale of one to ten for eyebrow raises if ten indicates that you 've discovered a new particle this eyebrow raise is about a four laughter i spent poking and prodding it with our most ruthless experimental sticks to see if it would withstand scrutiny but even after months of working feverishly sleeping in our offices and not going home coffee by the bucketful physicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams so after a few months we presented our little bump to the world with a very clear message this little bump interesting but it 's not definitive so let 's keep an eye on it as we take more data so we were trying to be extremely cool about it the news loved it people said it reminded them of the little bump that was shown on the way toward the higgs boson discovery better than that my theorist colleagues i love my theorist colleagues my theorist colleagues wrote five hundred papers about this little but what was it about this particular bump that caused thousands of physicists to collectively lose their cool this little bump was unique this little bump indicated that we were seeing an unexpectedly large number of collisions whose debris debris consisted of only two photons two particles of light and that 's rare particle collisions are not like automobile collisions they have different rules when two particles collide at almost the speed of light the quantum world takes over and in the quantum world these two particles can briefly create a new particle that lives for a tiny fraction of a second before splitting into other particles that hit our detector imagine a car collision where the two cars vanish upon impact a bicycle appears in their place laughter and then that bicycle explodes into two skateboards which hit our detector hopefully not literally and because of the special quantum properties of photons and it has to do with that gravity may seem i can briefly beat gravity when i jump but i can 't pick a proton out of my hand the strength of gravity compared to the other forces of nature it which is our current best description and quite frankly one of the most successful achievements of humankind which is absent from the standard model it 's crazy it 's almost as though most of gravity has gone missing we feel a little bit of it but where 's the rest of but one theoretical explanation proposes a wild solution you and i even you in the back we we live in three dimensions of space i hope that 's statement all of the known particles also live in three dimensions of space in fact a particle is just another name for a localized wobbling in space all the math that we use to describe all this stuff assumes that there are only three dimensions of space but math is math and we can play around with our math however what if the missing gravity is leaking into an extra spatial dimension that 's invisible to you and i what if gravity is just as strong as the other forces if you were to view it in this extra spatial dimension and what you and i experience is a tiny slice of gravity make it seem very weak if this were true would have to expand our standard model of particles to include an extra particle a hyperdimensional particle of gravity a special graviton that lives in extra spatial dimensions stuck as we are in three dimensions the way we always do by slamming together two protons that the collision reverberates into any extra spatial dimensions that might be there momentarily creating this hyperdimensional graviton that then snaps back into the three dimensions of the lhc and spits off two photons two particles of light and this hypothetical extra dimensional graviton is one of the only possible hypothetical new particles that has the special quantum properties that could give birth to our little two photon so the possibility of explaining the mysteries of gravity and of discovering extra dimensions of space perhaps now you get a sense as to why thousands of physics geeks collectively lost their cool over our little two photon bump a discovery of this type would the message from us experimentalists that actually were doing this work at the time was very clear we need more data crisp nobel prize so we took more data with five times the data several months later our little bump turned into a smooth line the news reported on a huge disappointment on faded hopes and on particle physicists being sad given the tone of the coverage you 'd think that we had decided to shut down the lhc and go home but that 's not what we did but why not i mean if i didn 't discover a particle and i didn 't if i didn 't discover a particle why am i here talking to you why didn 't i just hang my head in shame and go home and very much of what we do is cartography let me put it this way forget about the lhc for a second imagine you are a space explorer arriving at a distant planet searching for aliens what is your first task and report back to home base that 's the stage we 're at now we took a first and we can report that there are none we saw a weird looking alien bump on a distant mountain but once we got closer we saw it was a rock but then what do we do do we just give up and fly away absolutely not we would be terrible scientists if we did no we spend the next couple of decades sifting through the sand with a fine instrument peeking under every stone drilling under the surface new particles can either show up immediately as obvious to spot bumps or they can only reveal themselves after years of data taking we build a bigger machine planning is already underway for a we still find no new particles then perhaps we 're doing particle physics wrong perhaps we need to rethink things maybe we need more resources technology expertise than what we but imagine designing a particle physics experiment using such sophisticated algorithms that it could teach itself to discover but what if what if the ultimate question what if even artificial intelligence can 't help us answer our questions what if these open questions for centuries are destined to be unanswered for the foreseeable future what if the stuff that 's bothered me since i was a little kid is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime we will be forced to think in completely new ways we 'll have to go back to our assumptions and determine if there was a flaw somewhere and we 'll need to encourage more people to join us in studying science since we need maybe she 's not even born yet which would not be the end of physics but a novel beginning"
