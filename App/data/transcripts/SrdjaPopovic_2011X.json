  "transcript": "and whose name is people power i or for those of you who are monty python lovers a monty python type of sketch here it is it is december fifteen two thousand and ten you 're sitting in a building of the and you tell the story before the end of two thousand and eleven ben ali and mubarak and and ratko mladic would be in the hague now and then on top of it you add people from athens madrid and new york will demonstrate for social justice claiming they are inspired by arabs two guys in white appear they give you the strange t shirt take you to the nearest mental institution so i would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already and this phenomenon is called people power well it helped a local lech walesa to kick out one million soviet troops from poland and in beginning the end of the soviet union as we know it so what 's new in it what seems to be very new which is the idea i would like to share with you today is that there is a set of rules and skills and for so it was looking like the frozen region and there were only two types of meal there and everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions mainly secular people stepped out to do the change guess what they didn 't watch the demographics what is the average age of an egyptian twenty four how long was mubarak in power thirty one so the rest is the year in front of us and can you look at the age of the people on the streets of europe it seems that generation y is they will say people power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive they will say people power will work if the annual income of the country is between x and z they will say people power i with their big egos behind one single candidate against somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution you have one hundred thousand people in a nonviolent march one idiot or guess what takes all the cameras that one guy one single act of violence can literally destroy it 's only two hundred of us in this room we won 't call for the march of a million but what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion they 're very useful in violent oppression we are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used it was on tahrir square international community was constantly frightened that you know the islamists will overtake the revolution what they organized christians protecting muslims where they are praying a coptic wedding cheered by thousands of muslims the world has just changed the picture but somebody was thinking about this previously and you know showing off in front of the security forces and enthusiasm and humor on another and then it 's about the humor humor is such a powerful game changer and of course it was very big in poland you know we were just a small group of crazy students in serbia when we made this big skit we put the big petrol barrel with a portrait of mr president on it in the middle of the main street there was a hole in the top so you could literally come put a coin in get a baseball bat and hit his face and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing well that 's just the beginning of the show the real show starts when the police appears what will they do were nowhere to be seen we were like three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar they arrested the barrel and now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policemen dragging it to the police car that was the best day for newspaper photographers that they will ever have and you can always use humor there is also one big thing about humor everybody is talking about his majesty the internet and it is also a very useful skill but don 't rush to label things like a facebook revolution twitter revolution don 't with the substance it can put the price tag of state sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester this is the famous group we are all khaled said the nonviolent struggle is won in the real world in the streets you will never change your society towards democracy or you know the economy if you sit down and and there are living people who are winning the struggle whether the egyptians and tunisians will make it through the transition whether the syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline faced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war we cannot tell the same works for the western sector where you can see all these excited young people protesting around the world occupying this occupying that are they going to become the world wave are they going to find their skills their enthusiasm and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform or will they just stay complaining about the endless list what do the statistics have my friend maria stephan 's book talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle and there are some shocking you will see that out of sixty seven different cases in fifty of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power this is one more reason to look at this phenomenon this is one more reason to look at generation y and hope that they will find their skills thank you"
