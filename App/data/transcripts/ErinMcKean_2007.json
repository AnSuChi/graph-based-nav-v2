  "transcript": "notice we 're very specific that word dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite out of a lump of rock it 's made up of lots of little bits it 's little discrete that 's spelled now one of the perks of being a lexicographer besides getting to come to ted is that you get to say really fun lexicographical has this great pattern it 's called a double dactyl and just by saying double dactyl i 've sent the geek needle all the way into the red but lexicographical is the same pattern as higgledy piggledy right it 's a fun word to say and i get to say it a lot now one of the non perks of being a lexicographer is that people don 't usually have a kind of warm fuzzy snuggly what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this but the thing is i don 't want to be a traffic cop for one thing i just do not do uniforms and for another so if i had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work i would much rather be a i want to throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of english and see what marvelous creatures i can drag up from the bottom i blame the queen i blame the queen because dictionaries have really not changed our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f word which has happened in american dictionaries since so he 's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today when a guy who looks like that in that hat there 'd be virtually no learning curve and of course a few of us are saying okay computers computers what about computers the i would go on a hunger strike before i let them take away google book search from me computers don 't it 's steampunk what we have is an electric velocipede and ok what about online dictionaries right online dictionaries must be different this is the oxford english dictionary online one of the best online dictionaries this is my favorite word by the way erinaceous pertaining to the hedgehog family of the nature of a hedgehog very useful word so look at that online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen is flat look how many links there are in the actual entry two right those little buttons i had them all expanded except for the date chart so there 's not very much going on here there 's not a lot of clickiness and in fact online dictionaries and when you improve searchability you actually take away the one advantage of print which is serendipity serendipity is when you things you weren 't looking for because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult so now when you think about this what we have here woman 's making a ham for a big family dinner she goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away and she looks at this piece of ham and she 's like this is a perfectly good piece of ham why am i throwing this away she thought well and grandma says my pan was too small we have a pan that 's too small you know that ham butt is delicious there 's no reason to throw it away the bad words they think this map sucks when they find a nightspot or a bar and it 's not in the guidebook they 're like ooh this place must be cool it 's not in the guidebook when they find a word that 's not in the dictionary they think this must be a bad word why it 's more likely to be a bad dictionary why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive i really love books some of my best when we had cars when cars became the dominant mode of transportation we didn 't round up all the horses and shoot them you know there 're still going to be paper dictionaries but it 's not going to be the dominant dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in and if you 've got an artificial constraint artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview what if biologists could only study animals that what if we made aesthetic judgments about animals and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study and not very much and i think this is a problem i think we should study all the words because you can make beautiful expressions lexicography is really more about material science we are studying the tolerances how do i know that this word is real how can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball peen hammer they 're just the right tools for the job and so people say to me how do i know if a word is real you know anybody who 's read a children 's book if you love a word use it that makes it real if we 've transcended paper if we are worrying less about control and more about description then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile you use it in a new context you give it a new connotation you verb it you didn 't break it it 's just in a new position and that new position can be just as beautiful now right but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic but maybe to count the cars that go by library of congress million books of which half are in english if only one out of every ten of those books had a word that 's not in the dictionary in it and i find an if only one in one hundred of those pages had an un dictionaried word on it it would be an entire other so that 's a lot and i 'm not even talking about talking about blogs and i find more new words on boingboing in a given week than i do newsweek or time which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves and there 's one numbered definition in the little word thirty three numbered definitions one of them is just labeled miscellaneous technical senses do you know what that says to me that says to me it was friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub that 's a lexicographical cop out to say miscellaneous technical senses so we have and the thing is we could ask for help asking for help 's not that hard and this is more of a visual explanation if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language these bright spots are what we know about and the dark spots are where we are in the dark if that was the map of all the words in american english we don 't know very and we don 't even know the shape of the language but there 's no california we 're missing california that there 's a gap on the map so but even if it were rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days you know enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help and they 're doing a good job of it for instance there 's ebird where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings and then ornithologists can go and help track and there 's this guy mike oates mike oates lives in the u k he 's a director of an electroplating company he 's found more than one hundred and forty comets he downloaded data from the nasa soho satellite and that 's how he found them if we can find comets without a telescope and this is a little known technological fact about the internet but the internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm and words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography so there are a lot of really good word collecting sites out there right now but the problem with some of them is that they 're not scientific enough they show the word but they don 't show any context where did it come from who said it what newspaper was it in what book because a word is like an if you don 't know the provenance or the source of the artifact it 's a pretty thing to look at and one of the problems of knowing a word like synecdochically is that you really want an excuse but when you use a part of something like the dictionary is a part of the language or a flag stands for the united states it 's a symbol of the country but if we get a bigger pan then we can put all the words in we can put in all the meanings doesn 't everyone want more meaning in their lives and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language we can make it be the whole language we can put in all the"
