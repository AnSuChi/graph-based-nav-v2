  "transcript": "imagine that when you walked in here this evening you discovered that everybody in the room looked almost exactly the same ageless raceless generically good looking that person sitting right next to you might have the most idiosyncratic inner life but you don 't have a clue because we 're all wearing the same blank expression all the time that is the kind of creepy transformation that is taking over cities only it applies to buildings not people cities are full of roughness and shadow texture and color you can still find architectural surfaces of great individuality and character in apartment buildings in riga wooden houses in san francisco these aren 't palaces or cathedrals these are just ordinary residences expressing the ordinary splendor of cities they 're like that is that the need for shelter is so bound up with the human desire for beauty their rough surfaces give us a touchable city right streets that you can read by running your fingers over brick and stone but that 's getting harder to do because cities are becoming smooth sprout towers that are almost always made of concrete and steel and covered in glass you can look at skylines all over the world frankfurt and you see the same army of high gloss robots marching over the horizon just think of everything we lose when architects stop using the full range of available materials when we reject granite and limestone and sandstone and wood and copper and terra cotta and brick and wattle and plaster it 's as if you reduced all of the world 's cuisines down to airline food but worse still assemblies of glass towers like this one in moscow but not necessarily the lives of the rest of us those of us who navigate the spaces between the buildings and we expect to do so for shiny towers are an invasive species and they are choking our cities and killing off public space we tend to think of a facade as being like makeup a decorative layer applied at the end to a building that 's effectively complete but just because a facade is superficial doesn 't mean it 's not also deep let me give you an example of how a city 's surfaces affect the way we live in it when i visited salamanca in spain i gravitated to the plaza mayor balconies and windows and arcades each one a separate pocket of visual activity it becomes a stage where the generations can meet and real life starts to look the curtain goes up on salamanca so just because i 'm talking about the exteriors of buildings even so those surfaces give texture to our lives because buildings create the spaces around them and those spaces can and the difference often has to do with the quality of those exteriors so one contemporary equivalent of the plaza mayor in salamanca is in paris a windswept glass walled open space that office workers hurry through on the way from the metro to their cubicles but otherwise spend as little time in as possible the architect philip johnson tried to recreate a gracious european plaza in pittsburgh this is ppg place a half acre of open space encircled by and he ornamented those buildings with metal trim and bays and but at ground level the plaza feels like a black glass cage but it lacks the informality of a leisurely hangout it 's just not the sort of place you really want to just hang out and chat public spaces thrive or fail for many different reasons architecture is only one but it 's an important one some recent plazas like federation square in melbourne or superkilen in copenhagen and because they don 't rely excessively on glass it 's an ancient and versatile material ultraclear sheets to translucent bricks new coatings make it change mood in the shifting it has the magical power of being able to multiply real estate values by allowing views which is really the only commodity that developers have to offer to justify those surreal prices 19th century with the construction of the crystal palace in london glass leapt to the top of the list of quintessentially modern substances largely through some really spectacular office buildings like lever house in midtown manhattan designed by skidmore owings and merrill eventually the technology advanced to the point where architects could design structures so transparent and along the way glass became the default material of the high rise city and there but hundreds of millions of people need apartments and places to work in ever larger buildings so it makes economic sense to put up towers and wrap them in cheap and practical has a limited ability pre hispanic city of mitla in southern mexico today we look at those and we can see a historical and textural continuity between those carvings the mountains all around and that church which is built on top of the ruins using stone plundered from the site political murals communicative language that an epidemic of glass would simply wipe out the good news is that architects and developers have begun to rediscover the joys of texture without backing away from modernity some find innovative uses for old materials like brick and terra cotta others invent new products like the molded panels that snhetta used to give the san francisco museum of modern art that crinkly whose most visible feature is greenery and imagine if green facades were as ubiquitous as glass ones how much cleaner the air in chinese cities would become but the truth is that these are mostly one offs boutique projects not easily reproduced at a global scale and that is the point when you use materials that have a local significance you prevent cities from all looking the same copper the crown of the woolworth building but it fell out of fashion for a long time until shop architects used it to cover the american copper building it 's not even finished and you can see the way sunset buildings can be like people their faces broadcast their experience almost all other materials have the ability to absorb infusions of history and memory and project it ores that have been mined in the area for one hundred and fifty years and that also camouflage the building against the ochre hills so that you have a natural history museum that reflects the region 's natural history and when the chinese pritzker prize winner wang shu was building he didn 't just create a wrapper for the past two buildings one by jean nouvel and this one by frank gehry and the play of reflections that they toss back and forth is like a symphony in light disquieting after all cities are places of concentrated variety where the world 's cultures and languages and lifestyles come together and mingle so rather than encase all that variety thank you"
