  "transcript": "and then at the united states department of justice but when i became the attorney general two things happened that changed the way i see criminal and i couldn 't get this it turned out that most big criminal justice agencies like my own didn 't track the things that matter so after about a month of being incredibly frustrated i walked down into a conference room that was filled with detectives and stacks and stacks of case files they were trying to get the information i was looking for by going through case by case for the past five years it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton the second thing that happened is that i spent the day in the camden new jersey police department now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america i ran the camden police department because of that and what i saw in that room as we talked about how to reduce crime and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago we have no suspects and another said we had a shooting in this neighborhood last week we have no suspects we didn 't even know who was in our criminal justice system we didn 't have any data about the things that mattered and we didn 't share data or use analytics or tools to help us make better decisions and to reduce crime and for the first time i started to think about how we made decisions and i generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience when and what surprised me is that i found that that was exactly how we were doing it across the entire system in police departments in prosecutors 's offices in courts and in jails i wanted to introduce data and analytics and rigorous statistical analysis into our work in short i wanted to moneyball criminal justice and they went from a system that was based on baseball scouts who used to go out and watch players and use their instinct and experience the scouts ' instincts and experience to pick players from one to use smart data and rigorous statistical analysis to figure out how to pick players that would help them win games we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america so we went from doing low level drug crimes that were outside our building to doing cases of statewide importance because public safety to me is the most important function of government we can 't do any of the other things we want to do in our lives we have twelve million arrests every single year less than five percent of all arrests are for violent crime yet we spend they haven 't yet been convicted of a crime they 're just waiting for their day in court percent of people come back and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision in public safety and that decision is the determination of whether when and we let nonviolent people out they mean it and they believe it but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don 't have when we start to look at the data what we find time and time again is that this isn 't the case we find low risk offenders which makes up fifty percent of our entire criminal justice population we find that they 're in jail take leslie chew who was a texas man who stole four blankets on a cold winter night and he stayed in jail for eight months until his case came up for trial at a cost to taxpayers of more than nine thousand dollars and at the other the people who we find are the the reason for this is the way we make decisions judges have the best intentions when they make these decisions about risk but they 're making them subjectively which is that we are often wrong what we need in this space are strong data and analytics what i decided to look for was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool something that would let judges actually understand with a scientific and objective way what the risk was that was posed they were they were limited to the local jurisdiction in which they 'd been so that every single judge in the united states of america can have an objective scientific measure of risk what we did was we collected one point five million cases from all around the united states from cities from counties from every single state in the country the federal and with those one point five million cases which is the largest data set on pretrial in the united states today we were able to basically find that there were and we found that there were nine specific things that mattered all across the country and that were the most highly predictive of risk and so we built a universal risk assessment and it looks like this as you 'll see we put some information in but most of it is incredibly simple it 's easy to use it focuses on things like the defendant 's prior convictions whether they 've been sentenced and every single judge in the united states of america can use it because it 's been created on a universal data set what judges see if they run the risk assessment tool is this it 's a dashboard six of course being the highest and then in the middle you see elevated risk of violence what that says is that this person is someone who has an elevated risk of violence that the judge should look twice at now i want to say something really important it 's not that i think we i don 't but what i believe should happen is that we should take that data driven risk assessment and combine that with the judge 's instinct and experience to lead us to better decision making the tool went statewide in kentucky on july one and we 're about to go up in a number of other u s jurisdictions our goal quite simply is that every single judge in the united states will use a data driven risk tool within the next five years we 're now working on risk tools for prosecutors and for police officers as well to try to take a system and make it into one that runs on data and analytics and it 's why all these baseball teams use moneyball to win games the great news for us as well is that it 's the way that we can transform the american criminal justice system and we can make our system much fairer and more just thank you"
