  "transcript": "i am going to talk about myself which i rarely do because i i 'm a recovering narcissist so it 's actually drearier than self love it 's unrequited self love but i want explain how i came to design my own particular brand of comedy because i 've been through so many different forms of it i started with improvisation in a particular form of improvisation called theater games which and of course we live in a society that 's all about contradicting other peoples ' reality it 's all about which i think is why i 'm so sensitive to contradiction in general i see it everywhere like polls you know it 's always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of americans who don 't know the answer to any given question is always two percent seventy five percent of americans think alaska is part of canada but only two percent don 't know the effect that the debacle in argentina will have on the imf 's monetary policy buying it from us screams good taste this that i found in a magazine called california lawyer in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at enron surviving the slammer do 's and don and i suppose it 's a contradiction that i talk about science when i don 't know math you know because and by the way to i was so grateful to dean kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don 't enter the fields of science and technology because for instance the reason i don 't do math is i was taught to do math and read at the same time and the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince that 's why little girls don 't do math it 's too depressing by talking about science i also may as i did the other night incur the violent wrath of some scientists and they got very upset one of them to his credit i think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument don 't engage in serious arguments i don 't approve of them well rationality is constructed by what christie hefner was talking about today that mind body split you know when we say i as when rene descartes said i think therefore i am we mean the head and as david lee roth sang in just a gigolo i ain 't got no body that 's how you get rationality that 's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor that 's why you have the raspyni brothers whacking richard in the genital area and we 're laughing doubly then because he 's the 's the other way that humor like art buchwald it doesn 't make quite as much money as body humor i 'm sure but nevertheless what makes us treasure you and and adore you there 's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though which is as much as we revere the i know this because i read in the new york times the problem in this country facing this country is the university professors and their spawn and i 'm not an expert on sadomasochism but let me just read you a couple of random passages from page two hundred and seventeen the act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her was the kind of rapture she wanted when they lay together in bed it was as it had to be as the nature of the act demanded an act of violence the agony as an act of passion so you can imagine my surprise on reading in the new yorker that alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve claims ayn rand as his intellectual mentor it 's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix bad enough we had to see j edgar hoover in a dress now we have to picture alan greenspan in a black leather corset with a butt tattoo that and ayn rand of course ayn rand is famous for a philosophy called objectivism which objectivity basically is constructed in that same s & m way it 's and the object is the passive no voice i was so fascinated by that oxygen commercial i don 't know if you know this but according to a book by jessica benjamin the signs over the little boys cribs read i 'm a boy and the signs over the little girls cribs read it 's a girl yeah so the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls and this still goes on as i think i told you last year there 's a a poll that proves there was a poll that was given by time magazine in which only men were asked have you ever had sex with a woman you actively disliked and well fifty eight percent said yes which i think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say have you ever had sex yes they don 't even wait for the rest of it and of course two is part of something i 'm very interested in because this is why frankly i believe in political correctness i do i think it can go too far i think ringling brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the new york times magazine we have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our asian elephant partners maybe too far but you know i don 't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun i think you can make fun of the have but not the have nots which is why you don 't see me making fun of kenneth lay and his charming wife what 's funny about being down to four houses and i really learned this lesson during the during the sex scandals of the clinton administration or as i call them the good ol ' days laughter when people i knew you know people who considered themselves liberal and everything else were making fun of jennifer flowers and paula jones basically they were making fun of them for being trailer trash or white until you read as i did an ad in the los angeles times for sale white trash compactor i read a book by a woman named amy amy richlin who is the chair of the classics department at usc and the book is called the garden of priapus and she says that roman humor mirrors the construction of roman society so that that roman society was very top and so was humor there always had to be the butt of a joke so it was always the satirist like juvenal or martial represented the person who didn 't share that subject status and in stand up of course the comedian is supposed to dominate the audience a lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure and i got good at that when i was in stand up but i always hated it because they were dictating the terms of the interaction in the same way that engaging in a serious argument determines the content to some degree and i was looking for a form that didn 't have that and so i i wanted something that was more interactive i know that word is so debased now by the use of it by i really miss the old telemarketers now i 'll tell you that i do because at least there you stood a chance you know so the next time that one called i let him get halfway through his spiel and then i said you sound sexy the interactivity allows the audience to shape and that 's really what i 'm looking for and i was sort of as i was starting to analyze what exactly it is that i do i read a book called trickster makes this world by lewis hyde and it was like being psychoanalyzed i mean he had laid it all out and then coming to this conference i realized that most everybody here shared those and the qualities that i 'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible and one of these is i think this is what so in fact infuriated the scientists but i like to cross boundaries i like to as i said talk about things i know nothing about i hope that 's my agent because you aren 't paying me anything think it 's good to talk about things i know nothing about because i bring a fresh viewpoint to it you know i 'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see like for instance a mime once or a meme as he called himself and he said that i had to show more respect because it took up to eighteen years to learn how to do mime properly that 's how you know only stupid people go into it it only takes two years to learn how to talk objectivity unquote when you 're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you or share the same set like economists you know their definition of rational that we all act out of our own economic self interest well look at michael hawley or look at dean kamen or look at my grandmother my grandmother always acted in other people 's interests whether they wanted her to or not an olympics in martyrdom my grandmother would have lost on purpose no you take the prize you 're young i 'm old fritz lanting is that his name actually said that he was a go between that 's an actual quality of the trickster and another is non oppositional strategies and this is instead of contradiction where you deny the other person 's reality you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist i think there 's another philosophical construction i 'm not sure what it 's called but my example of it is a sign that i saw in a jewelry store it said ears pierced while you wait there the alternative just boggles the imagination them up around five if that 's ok with you huh huh what can 't hear you and another attribute of the trickster is smart luck that accidents that louis kahn who talked about accidents this is another quality of the trickster the trickster has a mind that is and i will say this to the scientists that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his i had no joke for that i just wanted to put the scientists in their place but here 's how i think i like to make change and that is in making connections this is what i tend to see almost more than contradictions like the what do you call those toes of the gecko you know the toes of the gecko curling and uncurling like the fingers of michael moschen i love connections like i 'll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe there are two attributes of matter in the newtonian universe one is space occupancy matter takes up space i guess the more you matter the more space you take up which explains the whole suv phenomenon and the other one though is impenetrability which explains why business always has to penetrate i mean why we forced china to open her markets and didn 't that feel good and now we 're being penetrated you know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes you and i suspect by someone who actively dislikes us and what i hope to do when i make these connections is short circuit people 's thinking you know make you not follow your usual train of association but make you rewire literally when people say about the shock of recognition it 's literally rewiring how you think i had a joke to go with this and i forgot it i 'm so sorry i 'm getting like the woman in that joke about have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother and and the daughter doesn 't want to say anything she doesn 't want to be like you 're too old to drive as tactfully as possible mom are you aware that you just went through two red lights and the mother says shock of recognition at the shock of recognition that completes the quadruple i just want to say two more things one is another characteristic of trickster is that the trickster has to walk this fine line he has to and you know the biggest hurdle for me in doing what i do is constructing my performance so that it 's prepared and unprepared finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared but being too prepared doesn 't leave room for the accidents to happen i was thinking about what moshe safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book hyde says that but to do that you have to lose all the other qualities because once you 're into beauty you 're into a finished thing you 're into and but if you don 't do that if you allow for the accident to keep on happening you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength and i like and the one final quality i want to say about trickster is that he doesn 't have a home he 's always and thank you for inviting me into it"
