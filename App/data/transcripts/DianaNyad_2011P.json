  "transcript": "years ago i was turning sixty and i don 't like being sixty and i started grappling with this existential angst of what little i had done with my life how had i spent my valuable time how could this have gone by like lightning and i couldn 't forgive myself for the countless countless hours i had lost in negative thought all the time i had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and and not stopping the sexual abuse when i was a kid and then my mother died at eighty two and so i starting thinking not only am i not happy with the past now i 'm getting choked with i 've only got twenty two years left to do with this short amount of time that 's just fleeting and i 'm not in the present whatsoever and i decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase something that would require because the dream was so big that i couldn 't get there it was an old dream that was lingering that was from so many years ago three decades ago it was deep in my imagination no one 's ever done it without a shark cage it 's daunting it 's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean it 's probably at my speed at my age for anybody 's speed at anybody 's age going to take sixty maybe seventy hours of continuous swimming never getting out on the boat and i had kept in good shape but swimming 's a whole different animal as a matter of fact this picture is supposed to be me and when you 're training for it 's an arduous difficult sport and i don 't remember smiling at any time during this sport and i compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and and other of the expedition type events but this is a sensory deprivation because i was making it through these and when i said i 'm going to go out and do a 15 hour swim and we 're coming into the dock after a long day and it 's now night and we come in and it 's fourteen hours and fifty eight minutes and i can touch the dock and we 're it 's got to be fifteen hours and i swim another minute out and another minute back to make the fifteen hours and i put together an expedition i sort of led i was the team leader and to get the government permissions you read in the paper you think it 's easy to get into cuba everyday try going the navigation is difficult there 's a big river called the gulf stream and there 's hypothermia and and a month ago the of september i stood on that shore and i looked across to that long long faraway horizon and i asked myself and they were they were prepared no stone left unturned was the mind ready you know you 're swimming with the fogged goggles you 're swimming at sixty strokes a minute so you 're never really focused on anything you don 't see well you 've got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head and i couldn 't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night because that 's when neil young comes but no for some reason i couldn 't wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing night before i started i finished stephen hawking 's the grand design and i couldn 't wait to trip the mind fantastic about the 50th hour i was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe is there an edge this an envelope we 're living inside of or no does it go onto infinity in both time and space and there 's nothing like swimming for fifty hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this i couldn 't wait to prove the athlete i am that nobody else in the world can do this swim and i knew i could do it and when i jumped into that water i yelled in my mother 's french and i started swimming and oh my god it was glassy and we knew it all fifty people on the boat we all knew this was it this was our time and i reminded myself a couple hours in you know and even though you 're feeling great at any one moment it 's not going to feel this good all the way across and i was thinking of the hypothermia and maybe some shoulder pain and all the other things the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater you 're immersed in the liquid you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways but no two hours in and i was on know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm evidently a piece this big of tentacle has a little barbs on it and each barb is not just stinging your skin it 's sending a venom the most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish and every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system fire help me somebody help me and the next thing is paralysis i feel it in the back and then i feel it in the chest up here and i can 't breathe and now i 'm not swimming with a nice long stroke i 'm sort then come convulsions a young man on our boat is an emt he dives in to try to help me he 's stung they drag him out on the boat and he 's evidently i didn 't see any of this but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out he 's and he 's saying bonnie i think i 'm going to die my breath is down to three breaths a minute i need help and i can 't help diana so that was at eight o 'clock at night the doctor medical team from university of miami arrived at five in the morning but was in the water taking prednisone shots taking xanax oxygen to the face it was like an icu unit in the water and i guess the story is that even navy seals who are stung by the box jelly they 're done they either die or they quickly get to and i swam through the night and i swam through the next day and the next night at dusk again wham the box jelly again all across the neck all across here and this time i don 't like it i didn 't want to give into it but there 's a difference between a non stop swim and a staged swim and i gave in to the staged swim and they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and i got back in and i swam through that night and into the next day and at forty one hours this body the devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that i couldn 't make the progress i wanted and the dream was crushed how odd is this intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together and i knew about the jellyfish but i was sort of cavalier a lot of athletes have this you know sort of i don 't worry about the best advice i got was from an elementary school class in and i was telling these kids one hundred and twenty of them they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor and i was telling them about the the jellyfish and how they 're gelatinous and you can 't see them at night especially and they have these long thirty to forty to and i said what 's your name henry henry what 's your question he said well i didn 't have a question so much as i had a suggestion he said you know those guys who really believe in what they believe in and so they well it 's odd that you 've learned of this as a noble noble kind of pursuit but yeah i know those guys he said that 's what you need you need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this and when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish they 're going to be busy with them and you 'll just scoot around i finished the swim like this i was swimming with this thing on that 's how scared of the jellyfish i was so now what do i do i wouldn 't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and so my journey now is to find some sort of grace i can feel proud i can stand here in front of you tonight and say i was courageous yeah thank you and with all sincerity i can say i am glad i lived those two years of my life that way because my goal to not suffer regrets and i want to live every day of the rest but the difference in accepting this particular defeat if there 's death then grace and acceptance and i don 't want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails but i can swim from cuba to but and by the way a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday was august nine hundred and forty nine and for some odd reason in wikipedia they had my death date too he said did you know you 're going to die the same place you were born new york city and it 's going to be in january of ' thirty five i said nope i didn 't know and now i 'm going to live to eighty five i have three more years than i thought and so i ask myself i 'm starting to ask myself now even before this this extreme dream gets achieved for me i 'm asking myself and maybe i can ask you tonight too to paraphrase the poet what is it you 're doing with this one wild and precious life of yours thank you very much"
