  "transcript": "it can spread over acres and acres of area or it could fit in a small space as small as your house garden is just two years old it attracts a lot of biodiversity bird call i wake up to this every morning like a disney princess i am an entrepreneur who facilitates the making of public parks and even a zoo to have one of such forests a forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together a forest can be an integral part of our urban existence a forest for me is a place so dense with trees that you just can 't walk into it it doesn 't matter how big or small they are most of the world we live in today was forest this was before human intervention then we built up our cities on those forests like so paulo as much as eight point four million other species on the planet our habitat stopped being our natural habitat but not anymore for some of us a few others and i today make these forests professionally i specialize in making cars in my previous job at toyota i learned how natural resources into products to give you an example we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree convert it into raw rubber and make a tire out of it the product but these products can never become a natural resource again we separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state that 's industrial production nature on the atom by atom all the natural products become a natural resource again this is something which i learned when i made a forest in the backyard of my own house and this was the first time i worked with nature rather than against it since then we have made such forests in twenty five cities across the world we find that every single element needed to make a forest all we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks if the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact so compact that water cannot seep in we mix some local biomass available around which can help soil become more porous water can now now seep in if the soil we will mix some more biomass some water absorbent material like peat or bagasse so soil can hold this water and it stays moist to grow plants need water sunlight and nutrition what if the soil doesn 't have any nutrition in it we don 't just we instead add microorganisms to the soil they produce the nutrients in the soil naturally and as their number grows the soil starts we survey the native tree species of the place how do we decide what 's native or not we survey a national park to find the last remains of a natural forest we survey the sacred groves or sacred forests around old temples and if we don 't find anything at all we go to museums to see the seeds or wood poems and literature from the place to identify the tree species belonging there shrub layer sub tree layer tree layer and canopy layer we fix the ratios of each layer and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix if we are making a fruit forest we increase the percentage of fruit bearing trees it could be a flowering forest wild evergreen forest we collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them we make sure that trees belonging to the same layer are not planted next to each other or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall we plant the saplings close to each other frost formation happens so soil can still breathe while it 's freezing outside the soil is very soft so soft that roots can penetrate into it easily initially the forest doesn 't seem like it 's growing but it 's growing under the surface in the first three months roots reach a depth of one meter these roots form a mesh microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots mushrooms appear overnight and this means the soil below has a healthy once these roots are established forest starts growing on the surface as the forest grows we want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees so we remove the weeds growing on the ground as this forest it blocks the sunlight every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn 't evaporate back into the atmosphere this dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture we gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest without watering the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark it immediately starts decaying as the forest grows more leaves fall on the surface it means more humus is produced it means more food so the forest can grow once established these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again probably forever in a natural forest like this no management is the best management it 's a tiny if the same trees same species would have been planted independently it wouldn 't grow so fast thank you very much"
