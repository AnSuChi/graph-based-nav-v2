  "transcript": "a human child and for quite a long time is a consumer it cannot be consciously a contributor it is helpless it needs the help of mother or a foster it can 't afford to as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist totally surrender that implies the trusted person as the child grows it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust a wordless blame which is more more difficult to really resolve the wordless self blame as the child grows to become an adult but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute to be a contributor i have enough to be compassionate is not a joke it 's not that simple one has to discover a certain bigness not in terms of money not in terms of power you it should be centered a bigness a wholeness otherwise compassion is just a word thank god we are empathetic when somebody 's in pain we pick up the pain what they have sweated so far has no meaning one person wins the tennis etiquette is both the players have to come to the net and shake hands the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it it looks as though he 's wishing that he didn 't win no religion can demolish that by indoctrination no culture no nation and nationalism nothing and that capacity to empathize is the window through which you do something that makes a difference in somebody 's life even words even time compassion is not defined in one form there 's no american compassion it is there in everybody it we are not talking about it will never remain occasional by mandate you cannot make a person compassionate you can 't say please love me love is something you discover it but in the english language it is also an action everybody 's experience in spite of one is happy and the one who is happy accepts himself known things and unknown things all of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself the subject me and the object the scheme of things fuse into oneness an experience nobody can say i am denied of that experience confirms that in spite of all your limitations all your wants and the credit cards and layoffs and finally baldness but the extension of the logic is that you don 't need to fulfill your desire to you are the very happiness the wholeness that you want to be there 's no choice in this that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot it has got to be that recognition maybe maybe the swami is right you start your new life i have no more reason to blame myself if one has to blame oneself one has a million reasons plus many in spite of my body being limited if it is black it is not white if it is white it is not black your knowledge is limited health is limited power is therefore limited and you cannot command compassion unless you become limitless and nobody can become limitless either you are and there is no way of your being not limitless too your own experience wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness love and itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that that emotion then that again transforms into to discover compassion you need to you learn swimming by swimming learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water you learn cooking by cooking having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook you have to fake it and make it you need to my predecessor meant that you have to act it out but you have an adverb that 's interesting to me that is where you fake you fake it and make it this is the mantra of the united states of america you fake it and make it take all the support system let me act compassionately do it you 'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion and slowly you 'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself which is oneness wholeness and that 's what you are"
