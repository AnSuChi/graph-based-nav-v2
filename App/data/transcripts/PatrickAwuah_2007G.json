  "transcript": "i am trying to contribute africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders i want to tell you some stories that explain my view we all heard about the importance of stories yesterday an american friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in ghana and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in africa that had taken me over a decade to reach twice she was involved in surgeries where they lost power at the hospital the emergency generators did not start there was not a twice the first time it was a c section thankfully baby was out the second time anesthetic wears off the patient feels pain he 's crying pitch black and that hospital could have afforded flashlights they another time she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had and so three months later just before she returned to the united states nurses in accra go on strike and her now what does this have to do with leadership you see the folks at the ministry of of health the nurses they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education they are our leaders their decisions their actions matter and when they fail a nation literally suffers those who 've been the civil servants and we need to train them right now my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in ghana occurred when i was sixteen years old we had just had a military coup i 'm stopped by two soldiers wielding and they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment why because the path i had taken no sign to this effect now i was sixteen i was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill i was especially concerned of what the girls girls might think and so i started to argue with these men a little reckless but you know i was sixteen i got lucky a ghana airways pilot falls into the same predicament because of his uniform they speak to him differently and they explain to him and gets us all released what lessons would you take from an experience like this several for me leadership matters those men are following the orders of a superior officer and i also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls so a few years after this event i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college for my education it was a breath of fresh air the faculty there didn 't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them they wanted us to be concerned about social issues my economics classes i got high marks for my understanding of but i learned something more profound than that which is that the leaders the managers of ghana 's economy were making breathtakingly bad decisions it matters a great deal but i didn 't really fully understand what had happened to me at swarthmore i had an inkling but i didn 't fully realize it until i went out into the workplace and i went to work at microsoft corporation and i was part of this team this thinking learning team whose job it was to design and implement new software and i realized just what had happened to me at swarthmore this transformation the ability to create is the most while i was the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the gdp of the republic of ghana it 's continued to the gap has i 've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred i mean it 's the people there who are so hardworking persistent creative but there were also some external factors infrastructure these things were provided by institutions run by the people that i now while i was at microsoft this funny thing happened i became a parent africa mattered more to me than ever before because i realized that the state of the african continent would matter to my children and their children that the state of the world the state of the world depends on what 's happening to africa as far as my kids would be concerned and at this time when i was going through what i call my and it seemed to me that that that was the wrong direction and i needed to be back helping i couldn 't just stay in seattle and and raise my kids in an upper middle class neighborhood and feel good about it this was not the world that that i 'd want my children to grow up and the first thing that i did was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were and three things kept coming up weak institutions and the people who run them the leaders now i was a little scared because when you see those three problems they seem really hard to deal with and they might say look don 't even try but for me i asked the question well where are these leaders coming from what is it about ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems so i went to look was happening in our educational system and it was the same learning by rote from primary school through graduate school very little emphasis and the typical graduate from a university in ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility this is wrong so i decided to engage this particular problem because it seems to me that every society and ghana and this is what i 'm doing now i 'm trying to bring the experience that i had at swarthmore i wish there was a liberal arts college in every african country i and what ashesi university is trying to do is to train a new generation of entrepreneurial leaders we and come up with workable solutions i 'll admit that there are times when it but we must believe that these kids are smart that if we involve them in their education if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront that our whole society confronts and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world that magic will and it said very simply i am thinking now and he signs off thank you it 's such a simple statement and it is an awesome thing to be a part i am thinking now this year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves there 's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code and if so what it should look like one of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart can we create a perfect society honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible now we cannot achieve perfection but if we reach for it i don 't know ultimately what they will do i don 't know whether they will decide to have this honor code but the conversation they 're having now about what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing am i just wanted to leave that slide up because it 's important that we think about it i 'm very excited about the fact that every student at ashesi university does community service before they graduate that for many of them it has been a life altering experience these young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of i am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government it 's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of it says a lot about the culture that 's forming it says a lot about her peers who elected her it turns out that corporate west africa also appreciates what 's happening with our students we 've graduated two classes of students and the things that they 're most impressed about is work ethic the persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to tackle problems that they haven 't seen before this is good because over the past five years there have been times when i 've felt this is i think that the current and future leaders of africa have an incredible opportunity it 's an incredible opportunity there aren 't very many more opportunities like this in the world i believe that africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent we have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation it will depend on inspired leadership thank you"
