  "transcript": "affects all of us especially the ones that come back over and over again the highly invasive and the ones that defy medical treatment even when we throw our best drugs at them engineering at the molecular level working at the smallest of scales can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer cancer is a very clever disease we 've learned how to address relatively well with known and established drugs and surgery but there are some forms of cancer that 't respond to these approaches and the tumor survives or comes back even after an onslaught of drugs we can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer as kind of supervillains in a comic book they 're clever they 're adaptable and they 're very good at staying alive the genes that are modified inside these tumor cells can enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival allowing the cancer cell to live through even our best chemotherapy treatments the cell to push the drug out imagine the cell effectively spits out the drug we have a supervillain and we need a new and powerful mode of attack actually we can turn off a gene the key is a set of molecules known as sirna sirna are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene each sirna molecule can turn off a specific gene inside the cell but there is a it degrades within seconds it has to be packaged protected through its journey through the body on its way to the final target inside the cancer cell but how do we carry that out using molecular engineering and it 's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell let 's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle first let 's start it 's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug this is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell 's life around this core the two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the sirna from degrading in the bloodstream we 're almost done but there is one more big obstacle we have to think about in fact it may be the biggest obstacle of all how do we deploy this superweapon i mean every good weapon needs to be targeted we have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells that reside in the tumor but our bodies have a natural immune defense system cells that reside in the bloodstream and pick out things that don 't belong so that it can destroy or eliminate and guess what our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object we have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object by disguising it so we add one more negatively charged layer around this nanoparticle which serves two purposes it creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle that gives us an invisibility cloaking effect without getting eliminated by the body once bound the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle alright i feel the same way then the chemotherapy drug comes out of the core and destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently allowing the chance to sweep out tumors without leaving behind any bad guys we 've tested these nanostructure particles in animals using a highly aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer this triple negative breast cancer exhibits the gene that spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered usually doxorubicin let 's call it dox is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer dox only doubling in then we tried our combination they actually decreased in and were eliminated in some cases the tumors were actually regressing what 's great about this approach is that it can be personalized we can add many different layers of and we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core as doctors learn how to test patients and understand certain tumor genetic types they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use it is a very aggressive cancer in part because it 's discovered at very late stages when it 's highly advanced and there are a number of genetic mutations after the first round of chemotherapy this cancer comes back for seventy five percent of patients and it usually comes back in ovarian cancer is one of the biggest supervillains out there and we 're now directing our superweapon toward its defeat i usually don 't get to work with patients but i recently met a mother who is an ovarian cancer survivor mimi and her daughter paige i was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength that both mother and daughter displayed we spoke about the different technologies directed at cancer and mimi was in tears as she explained how learning about these efforts gives her hope for future generations including her own daughter this really touched me it 's not just about building really elegant science it 's about changing people 's lives it 's about understanding the power of engineering on the scale of molecules i know that as students like paige move forward in their careers infectious disease just as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me and has provided a way of engineering on the tiniest scale that of molecules to heal thank you"
