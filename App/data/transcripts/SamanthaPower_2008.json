  "transcript": "i spent the better part of a decade looking at and i 'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about american and democratic responses to mass atrocity and that moment came on april so fourteen years ago almost in the middle of the rwandan genocide in which eight hundred thousand people would be systematically exterminated by the rwandan government and some in the new york times the paper reported that somewhere between two hundred thousand and three hundred thousand people had already been killed in the genocide it was in the paper not on the front page it was a lot like the holocaust coverage it was buried and amazingly genocide itself was not seen as honest moment occurred and that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado what 's up what 's going on in the u s government two to three hundred thousand people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in rwanda it 's two weeks into the genocide at that time but of course at that time you don 't know why is there so little response response out of washington why no hearings no denunciations no people getting arrested in front of the rwandan embassy or in front of the white house she was so honest she said it 's a great question all i can tell you is that in my congressional office in colorado and my office in washington we 're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered but nobody is calling about the people the phones just aren 't ringing about the people and the reason i give you this moment is there 's a deep truth in it and that truth is or was in the we didn 't have an endangered people 's movement we had holocaust education in the schools most of us were groomed not only on images of of nuclear catastrophe but also on images and knowledge of the holocaust there 's a museum of course on the mall in washington right next to lincoln and yet the politicization of never again the operationalization of never again had never occurred and that 's what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows that if we have to make it such there has to be a role there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to now here and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon and that is that that looks destined in fact to be permanent it grew up in response to the atrocities in darfur it is comprised of students there are something like three hundred anti genocide chapters on college campuses around the country it 's bigger than the anti apartheid there are something like five hundred high school chapters devoted to stopping evangelicals have joined it jewish groups have joined it hotel rwanda watchers have joined it but it has been amazingly successful in one regard in that it it has become it has as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost there will be a political price to be paid for not having an heroic imagination for not being an upstander but for being in fact a bystander now because it 's student driven there 's some amazing things that the movement has done they have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced i think fifty five universities in twenty two states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan they have a but for those of you who may not be you and you don 't even have to know who your congressperson is it will refer you directly to your congressperson to your u s senator to your governor where divestment legislation is pending they 've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide i think the most innovative thing they and it takes students to introduce genocide grades so what you now have when a congress is in session is members of congress calling up these i just want to get a c help me and the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that and there 's always something to do now what this movement has done is it has extracted from over stretch military financial diplomatic the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal administration doesn 't like the expenditure of three billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep basically the people who 've been displaced from their homes by the sudanese government by the so called janjaweed the militia to keep those people alive until something more durable can be achieved and recently or now not that recently about six months ago the authorization of a peacekeeping force twenty six thousand that will go and that 's all the bush administration 's leadership and it 's all because of this bottom up pressure and the fact that the phones haven from the beginning of this crisis the bad news however to this question of will evil prevail is that evil lives on the people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so called janjaweed these men on horseback with spears and kalashnikovs women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families humanitarian aid the dirty secret of it is it has to be really to be edible are themselves subjected to rape which is a tool of the genocide that is being used the force has been authorized so we have achieved an awful lot relative and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here as we speak or what what the movement has done been necessary but not sufficient stops it does not have i think want to bring never again the guilt that the clinton administration expressed that bill clinton expressed over rwanda created a space in our society for a consensus that rwanda was bad wrong and we wish we had done more and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of european governments for the most part haven 't acknowledged responsibility and there 's nothing to kind of to push back and up against and you will have to see other citizens in democracies but actually making it such why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering we have a credibility problem a legitimacy problem in international institutions it is structurally really really hard to do as the bush administration rightly does which is to denounce genocide on a monday now other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved let me be clear they 're in some ways using what do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world 's worst places the world 's worst suffering and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost the place that i turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of and that is a brazilian named sergio vieira de mello he was the victim of the first ever suicide bomb in iraq it 's hard to remember but there was actually a time in the summer of two thousand and three even after the u s invasion where apart from looting civilians were relatively safe in iraq now who was sergio sergio vieira de mello was his name he was described to me before i met him in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four as someone who was a cross between james bond on the one hand and bobby kennedy on the other and in the u n he was drawn to the flames he chased the flames he was like a moth to the flames something of an adrenalin junkie he was successful with women because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist as people always wondered about bobby kennedy and john kennedy in that way what he was was a decathlete of nation building of problem solving of troubleshooting precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world 's suffering tends to get concentrated these are the places he was drawn to he moved with the headlines he was in the u n for thirty four years he joined at the age of twenty one he was there in he was in sudan when the civil war broke out there he was in lebanon amazingly he was in lebanon the u n base was used palestinians staged attacks out from behind the u n base israel then invaded and overran the u n base sergio was in beirut when the u s embassy was hit by the first ever suicide attack against the united states people date the beginning of this new era to nine eleven but surely one thousand nine hundred and eighty three with the attack on the us embassy and the marine barracks which sergio witnessed those are in fact in some ways the dawning of the of the era that we find ourselves in today from lebanon he went to bosnia in was the first person to negotiate with the khmer rouge talk about evil prevailing i mean here he was in the room with the embodiment he actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it doesn 't need to prevail that he earns the nickname not sergio but serbio while he 's living in the balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations he then goes to rwanda and to congo in the aftermath of the genocide and he 's the guy who has to decide ok the genocide is over eight hundred thousand people have been killed the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries into congo into tanzania so we 're going to go we 're going to set up camps uh oh the killers are within the camps well i 'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves let me go door to door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation and their response of course was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm 's way to do that so then you have to make the decision do you turn off the international spigot of life support or do you continue feeding the civilians knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps literally sharpening sharpening their knives late is the cause du jour he 's the guy put in charge he 's the paul bremer or the jerry bremer of first kosovo and then east timor he governs the places he has to decide on tax policy on currency on border patrol on policing he has to make all these judgments he 's a brazilian in these places he speaks seven languages he 's been he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to what do you do when the most powerful country in the united nations is maybe you stay reticent maybe you try to charm bush and that 's what he did and in so doing he earned himself unfortunately his final and tragic appointment to iraq the one that resulted in his death which is so devastating is that despite predicating the war on iraq on a link between saddam hussein and terrorism in nine eleven believe it or not the bush pre war planning to respond to terrorism so sergio this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue stateless the guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career like a refugee because he represents the u n if you represent everyone in some ways you represent no one you 're what the american the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue believe it or not was literally these heroic two american soldiers went into the shaft building was shaking one of them had been at nine eleven and lost his buddies on september 11th and yet went in and risked his life in order to save sergio but all they had was a woman 's handbag literally one of those basket handbags and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person the person we most need to turn to now this shepherd at a time when so many of us feel like we 're lacking guidance for what it 's worth is after sergio and twenty one others were killed that day in the attack on the u n the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting the cranes the things that you would have needed to do the rescue but it was too late for sergio i want to wrap up but i want to close with what i take to be the four lessons from sergio 's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing which is how i would have framed the question here 's this guy who head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with we as citizens are grappling with now what do we take away first i think is his relationship to in fact evil is something to learn from he started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers he would charge up to people who were violating international law and he would say violating this is the u n charter don 't you see it 's unacceptable what you 're doing and in lebanon southern lebanon in ' eighty two he said to himself and to everybody else i will never use the word unacceptable i will never use it i will try to make it such but i will never use that word again but he lunged in the opposite direction he started as i mentioned to get in the room with evil to not denounce and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname serbio for instance and even when he negotiated with the khmer rouge i think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from don 't be afraid of talking to your adversaries but don 't bracket what happened before you entered the room don 't black box history don 't check your principles at the door and i think that 's something that we have to be in the room whether it 's nixon going to china or khrushchev and kennedy or reagan and gorbachev all the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room and it doesn 't have to be an act of weakness you can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person that regime is the problem and that you the united states are not the problem second take away from sergio 's life briefly what i take away and this in some ways is the most important exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really really unusual at a micro level the individuals around him were visible he saw them he thought you know we talk about democracy promotion but we do it in a way sometimes that 's an affront to people 's dignity we put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we 've spent three billion it 's incredibly important those people would no longer be alive but it 's not a way to live if we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us and as a country if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries it would be something of a revolution he talked a lot about freedom but what sergio was talking about is let 's calibrate let 's actually see it clearly we have reason to be afraid of of melting ice caps we have reason to be afraid that we haven 't secured loose nuclear material in the former soviet union let 's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and we lunge towards the extremes when we aren 't operating and trying to again calibrate our relationship to the world around us fourth and final point he somehow because he was working in all the world 's worst places and all lesser evils and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him i mean such an acute awareness of how hard it was how sisyphean and yet aware of that complexity humbled by it he wasn 't paralyzed by it and we as citizens as we go through this experience of the kind of the crisis of confidence crisis of competence crisis of legitimacy i think there 's a temptation to pull back from the world and say iraq we don 't know what we 're doing we can 't afford to pull back from the world it 's a question of how to be in the world and the lesson i think of the anti genocide movement that i mentioned that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what what it has set out to do it 'll be many decades probably before that happens we can 't rely upon our institutions to do the work of of necessarily talking to adversaries on their for having respect for dignity and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility i think the short answer is no not unless we let it"
