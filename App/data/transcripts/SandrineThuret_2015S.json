  "transcript": "i was talking to one of my and he was telling me sandrine this is puzzling some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression and i responded to him well from my point of view that makes sense the drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain and then robert looked at me like i was crazy and said but sandrine these are adult patients adults do not grow new nerve cells and much to his surprise i said well actually we do and this is a phenomenon that we call medical school so robert you know being the good doctor that he is wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic a little bit better and i took of one of the most exciting parts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis so this is this gray structure in the center of the brain however what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new and if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in what you actually see here in blue so when it comes to the human brain my colleague jonas frisn from the that we produce seven hundred new neurons per day in the hippocampus you might think this is not much compared to the billions of neurons we have but by the time we turn fifty we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult born neurons so why are these new neurons important and what are their functions first we know that they 're important for learning and memory and in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain and this is especially new and true for spatial recognition so like how you navigate your way in the city and neurons are not only important for memory capacity but also for the quality of the memory and they will have been helpful to add time to our memory and they will help differentiate very similar memories like how do you find your bike that you park at the station but in a slightly different position so in an animal model of depression we have seen that we have a lower level of neurogenesis and we decrease the symptoms of depression so by then robert had understood that very likely his patients were suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer because the cancer drug had stopped and it will take time to generate so collectively now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation or mood or even prevent the decline associated with aging so the next question is can we control neurogenesis and we are now going to do a little quiz and you tell me if you think they will increase how about stress however it 's all about balance here we don 't want to fall in a situation about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation and then finally how about running and here you see a section of the hippocampus and the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons to be and now you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage so you see the massive increase of the black but that 's not all so here we have a sample of diet and i 'm just going to point a few out to you calorie restriction of twenty to thirty percent will increase neurogenesis will increase neurogenesis conversely a diet rich in high saturated fat will have a negative impact on neurogenesis however so next time you are at a dinner party you might want to reach for this possibly let me point out the last one a quirky one so japanese groups are fascinated with food textures and they have shown that actually soft diet where we need to look at the cellular level has been generated using animal but this diet has also been given to human participants and what we could see such as calorie restriction will improve memory capacity exacerbate symptoms of depression as opposed to omega 3 fatty acids which increase neurogenesis and also help to decrease the symptoms of depression so we think that the effect of diet on mental health on memory and mood is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus but it 's also the of the food when you eat it and how much of it you eat and how we can control their survival and their production we also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of robert 's patients and on your side i leave thank you margaret heffernan fantastic research sandrine now i told you you changed my life i now eat a lot of blueberries sandrine thuret very good mh i 'm really interested in the running do i have to run or is it really just about aerobic exercise getting oxygen to the brain could it be any kind of vigorous exercise st so for the moment we can 't really say if it 's but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production"
