  "transcript": "i collaborate with bacteria and i 'm about to show you some stop motion footage that i made recently where you 'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment so what you 're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing and as they do so they create an electrical charge and these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria one of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water and the desalination process is one where we take out salts we can use it for drinking and agriculture removing the salts from water we take the water from the sea and we apply pressure and this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane this and also the brine that 's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea and this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it 's pumped back out into so i work in singapore at the moment and this is a place that 's really a leading place for and singapore proposes by two thousand and and this in terms of magnesium equates to a $ four point five billion imagine a mining industry that doesn 't mean defiling the earth imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube thank you"
