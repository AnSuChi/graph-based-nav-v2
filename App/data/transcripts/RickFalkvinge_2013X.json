  "transcript": "this is going to be a motivational speech because imagine my motivation standing between this strong i 'm sorry how many in here have heard of the swedish pirate party before show of hands i frequently ask how many have heard of any other political party and there 's always just scattered hands in the audience compared to this first question which is one half to two thirds this is actually the first time ever that does not match it was practically everybody so for those who haven 't heard of us and we love civil liberties we decided to stand tall about it instead i led it for its first five years the european elections the last european elections we became the largest party and the the most coveted youth demographic sub 30 and what 's interesting is we did that on less than one percent we had a campaign budget total of fifty thousand euros they had six million between them beat them and i 'm gonna share the secret recipe of how we did that we developed swarm methodologies and i 'll get to that in just a minute we have forty five people in various german state parliaments we 're in the and that 's not bad for a political movement that hasn 't even been around for a decade so today we 're going to talk a bit about how people are motivated to be part of change to be part of something bigger than how you can channel this into an organization that harnesses this great power come out a little on the better when i frequently make them very upset when i contradict them and say that no your employees are not your most valuable asset your most valuable asset is the thousands of people who want to work for you for free and you don 't let them they get very upset about that a swarm is a congregation of tens of thousands of volunteers that have chosen of their own will to converge on a common goal there 's this futurama quote you gotta do what you love seriously what kind of idiot thinks they can change the world what you need to do is to put a stake in the ground you need to announce your goal just say i want to accomplish this i 'm going to do this and it doesn 't need to be very costly my announcement was just two lines in a chat channel hey look the pirate party has its website up now after new year 's and the address that was all the advertising i ever did the next time i had several hundred activists wanting to work with us when people can rally to a and that 's what gives you this two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency it 's a huge advantage you 're running circles around all the legacy organizations and there are four goals that need to be fulfilled in your goal in order for this to work these four criteria are that your goal must we should make the world a better place or we should all feel good now or are not there yet it needs to be credible somebody seeing the project plan that you 're posting needs to see that yes this project plan will take us from where we are to where we want to be and when you add the subgoals together we 've gone to where we want it needs to be and this is where it gets exciting in terms of working anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say i want to do this and there 's my spot and they will be able to jump right into the project and start working on it and that is exactly what 'll happen it needs to energize people it needs electrify people shoot for the moon we 've already been there shoot for mars you will never be able to get a volunteer swarm forming electrify people go to mars a lot of people kind of balk at the obstacles we 're going to climb a huge mountain so how do you motivate people to do that well it turns out that obstacles are not the problem not knowing the obstacles is the if you know how high the mountain is you know exactly what it takes to scale it we know exactly how far away mars is and what it takes to get there if you can plan it like a project we need two dozen volunteer rocket scientists one dozen volunteer some crazy dude who will mix rocket fuel in his backyard and so on when you can list the resources you know what you need to get there when you know what you need to get there you can go there and the next thing is to encourage this development of a swarm intelligence which is where the cost efficiency comes in there 's a ted talk and it presents science on how we 're really motivated by three things in terms of larger creative tasks when we work for something bigger than ourselves we work for mastery and purpose we 've covered purpose already as in working for something bigger credible inclusive and epic so where that motivation talk ends what it doesn 't answer is how do you build an organization that harnesses this motivational power and this is where working swarmwise comes in this is where swarm intelligence comes in turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for and each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school we have people in many many parliaments to prove it trust and scalability but you 've got to communicate your vision so passionately so strongly that everybody knows what the goal is and when tens of thousands we had a three person rule in our organization saying that if three self identified volunteers in the movement were in agreement that something was good for the movement they had the green light from the highest office to go ahead and act in the name of the including spending resources when you talk about this kind of empowerment to but you know what i led this organization for five years there were fifty thousand it was not abused once it was not abused one single time turns out when you give people the keys to the castle and look them in the eye and say i trust you we should expect mistakes if you 're pioneering something that means you must some things won 't go as planned that 's part of the definition of venturing into the unknown so you must communicate that we expect some things to go wrong to create a maybe after we 've tried fifteen times we 've mastered some some specific subject so you want to minimize the time it takes to try those fifteen times we optimize on trust we encourage you need to communicate your vision so strongly so that everybody can translate it into their own context because language is an incredibly strong advantage of working swarmwise some of them will work if somebody on this that 's ok because we all trust each other to work for the better of the movement and it 's ok that i don 't understand their social context i 'm not expected to i understand my social context i contribute with something i know finally scalability get feet in business school they teach you to use a lean organization forget that just scale up the organization from the get go start with ten thousand empty boxes and an org chart covering when you have lots and lots of small responsibilities in such a scaffolding that supports the swarm supports the activists you 'll find that boxes in the org charts are getting filled in quite rapidly and they start to get filled in beyond your horizon with people you 've never heard of and so this swarm keeps growing keeps growing to tens of thousands of people each taking on something something small with very very decentralized mandate to act on the organization this is when you have this beehive logic where everybody knows what 's to be done everybody is taking their own small steps towards it this is when you 're awarded by the this is not just a silver bullet so we 've been talking a lot about the big picture today you can use these swarm methods for a lot of stuff do you want to change the world maybe you 're into social change you want to introduce unconditional basic income or you can do this using these methods you can do this it 's about leadership it 's about deciding what you want to do and telling it to the world because no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world so one question i want everybody here to ask themselves today somebody makes it happen do you want to be that person and then one one last thing and that is fun this goes beyond having a pinball machine in the this is required to succeed to get that cost efficiency advantage of two orders of magnitude for the reason that you need to attract volunteers and people in this aspect are rather predictable people will go to other people who are having fun in contrast they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun so it 's an absolute and unavoidable requirement for organizational and operational success when you 're working so in summary a recipe for a swarm organization using these motivational methods to a huge competitive advantage inclusive and epic your organization needs to be optimized and that will reward you with two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency advantage thank you"
