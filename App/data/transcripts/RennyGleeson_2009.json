  "transcript": "what i wanted to talk to you about today is two things one the rise of a culture of availability and two a request so we 're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device across all social strata we 're seeing along with that proliferation of mobile devices an expectation of availability and with that comes the third point which is obligation and an obligation to that availability and the problem is we 're still working through from a societal standpoint how we allow people to be available there 's a significant delta in fact between what we 're willing to accept apologies to hans rosling he said anything that 's not using real stats is a lie but the big delta so we 've developed certain tactics and strategies to to cover up although you can see the gentleman up on the right here on the right he 's doing the stretch it 's that or my favorite the love you mean it nothing says i love you like let me find somebody else i give a damn about this one coming to us from india you can find this on youtube the gentleman who 's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging or what we call the sweet gravy stop me before i kill again what this is doing is we find a a direct collision we find a direct collision between availability and what 's possible through availability and a fundamental human need which we 've been hearing about a lot actually the the need to create shared narratives we 're very good at creating personal narratives but it 's the shared narratives that make us a culture effectively what you 're saying to them is you are not as important as literally almost anything that could come to me through this device look around you there might be somebody on one right now participating in multi dimensional engagement our reality right now is less interesting than the story we 're going to tell about it later this one i love this poor kid clearly a prop don 't get me wrong a willing prop but the kiss that 's being documented kind of looks like it sucks so as we lose the context it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative becomes the context in which we live the stories that we tell"
