  "transcript": "and athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly the winner of the two thousand and twelve olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes had he been racing against the winner of the one thousand nine hundred and four olympic marathon he would have won by nearly an hour and a half now we all have this feeling that we 're somehow just getting better as a human race inexorably progressing but it 's not like we 've evolved into a new species in a century so what 's going on here i want to take a look at what 's really behind this march of athletic that 's a lot in sprinter land to give you a sense of how much it is i want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist ross tucker thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see usain bolt the fastest man in history bang the gun goes off an american sprinter jumps out to the front usain bolt starts to catch him usain bolt passes him and as the runners come to the finish you 'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line you can open your eyes now listen to it again when you think of it like that it 's not that and then consider that usain bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran rather than blocks jesse owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from biomechanical analysis listen to it again that 's the difference track surface technology has made and it 's done it throughout the running world consider a longer event in nowadays college kids do that every year on rare occasions a high school kid does it sir roger bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today so i consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks and their consensus that it 's one and a half percent slower so if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub four mile on a synthetic track this is what happens only five hundred and thirty are left if you look at it from that perspective fewer than ten new men per [ year ] have joined the sub four mile club since sir roger bannister now five hundred and thirty is a lot more than one that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while that was his idea of clearly athletes have gotten more savvy about performance enhancing drugs as well take a look at the record for the 100 meter freestyle but it 's punctuated by these steep cliffs this first cliff the introduction of the flip turn rather than stopping and turning around athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction the introduction of swimsuits throughout sports technology has changed the face of performance in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two eddy merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at thirty miles three thousand seven hundred and seventy four feet now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic all the way until one thousand nine when it was set at thirty five miles one thousand five hundred and thirty one feet nearly five miles farther than eddy merckx cycled in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two but then in two thousand the international cycling union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record thirty miles a grand total of eight hundred and eighty three feet farther than eddy merckx cycled more than four decades ago the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed and this showed in athletes ' bodies in the 1920s the average elite high jumper and average elite shot putter were the same exact size but as that idea started to fade away as sports scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches and athletes ' bodies became more different from one another if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of then television and the internet gave millions or in some cases billions of people a ticket the financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance it looks like this the scientists who discovered it call it the big bang of body types in sports where height is prized like basketball the tall athletes got taller suddenly anybody who could be an nba player wanted to be and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships the proportion of men in the nba who are at least seven feet tall doubled but a seven foot tall man is incredibly rare in the general population so rare that if you know an american man between the ages of twenty and forty who is at least seven feet tall there 's a seventeen percent chance he 's in the and that 's not the only way that nba players ' bodies are unique the average nba player is a shade under six ' seven with arms that are seven feet long not only are nba players ridiculously tall they are ludicrously long had leonardo wanted to draw the vitruvian nba player he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse not a circle and a square the average elite female gymnast shrunk from five three to four ' nine on average over the last thirty years the average length of the forearm of a water polo player in relation to their total arm got longer all the better for a forceful throwing whip and small got smaller and the weird weirder type is a long torso and short legs it 's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water but because of the body types advantaged in their sports they wear the same length pants seven inches difference in height these men have the same length legs now in some cases the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren 't previously competing at all like kenyan distance runners kenyans think of the kalenjin the kalenjin make up just twelve percent of the kenyan population and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes it 's the same reason that a radiator has long coils to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out and because the leg is like a pendulum the longer and thinner it is at the extremity the more energy efficient it is to swing consider that seventeen american men in history have run faster than two hours and ten minutes in the marathon that 's a four minute and 58 second per mile pace thirty two kalenjin men did that last october still even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don 't account for all of the changes in performance athletes have a different mindset than they once did have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they 're thrown across a room that 's the power that 's contained in the human body but normally we can 't access nearly all of it our brain acts as a limiter tearing tendons or ligaments but the more we learn about how the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won 't be in mortal danger by pushing harder but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames large surface area of joints for shock absorption and when we run we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads our primate cousins can 't do that they have to run like this and we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running have you ever looked at an ape 's butt they have no buns ultra endurance they 've taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before athletes like spanish endurance racer with a sweatshirt there tied around his waist it 's so steep he can can 't even run here he 's pulling up on a rope this is a vertical ascent of more than eight thousand feet now that he has done this other athletes will follow just as other athletes followed after sir roger bannister ran under four minutes in the innovation in sports whether that 's new track surfaces or new swimming techniques the democratization of sport the spread to new bodies and to new populations around the world and imagination in sport and better than ever thank you very much"
