  "transcript": "when i wrote my memoir the publishers were really confused was it about me as a child refugee or as a woman who set up a one that went public and eventually employed over eight thousand five hundred people or as a philanthropist that 's now given away serious money well it turns out i 'm all of these so let me tell you my story i was five years old clutching the hand of my nine year old sister and had very little idea as to what was going on what is england but but i 've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train i decided to make mine i just got on with it let me take you back to the early i set up my own software house at one of the first such startups in britain but it was also a company of women a nobody would buy software certainly not from a woman although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees there was a glass ceiling to our progress and i wanted opportunities for women i recruited professionally qualified women who 'd left the industry on marriage or when their first child was expected and structured them into a organization we pioneered the concept of women going back into the when i took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me or the only woman that and in those days on the stock exchange i couldn 't drive a bus or fly an airplane indeed i couldn 't open a bank account without my husband 's permission nobody really expected much from people at work or in society because all and i couldn 't really face that so i started to challenge the so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she my company called freelance programmers and that 's precisely what it was and financed by and financed by my labor and by borrowing against the house my interests were scientific the market was commercial things such as payroll which i found rather boring so i had to compromise with operational research work which had the intellectual and eventually the work came in we disguised the domestic and part time nature of the staff by offering fixed prices one of the very first to do so and who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder of supersonic concord would have been done by a bunch of women working in their own homes used was a simple trust the staff approach we even used to ask job applicants do you have access to a telephone an early project was to develop software standards on management control protocols and software was and still is a maddeningly activity so that was enormously valuable they were adopted by nato including gay and transgender worked with pencil and paper to develop flowcharts defining each task to be done which was then sent by mail to a data center to be punched onto paper tape or card and then in order to verify it all this before it ever got near a computer that was programming in the early thirteen years from startup equal opportunity legislation came in in britain and that made it illegal to and as an example of unintended consequences my female company had to let the men in when i started my company of women the men said how interesting because it only works because it 's small but of no strategic interest and later when it was a they sort of said you can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads they 're flat on top for being patted patronizingly and we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink let me share with you two surround yourself with and choose your partner very very carefully because the other day when i said my husband 's an angel a woman complained crisis our late son giles was an only child and then at two and a half he lost the little speech that he had unmanageable toddler giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that i set up to pioneer services for autism and then there 's been a groundbreaking prior 's court school for pupils with autism and i 've just started a three year think tank for autism i 've also founded the oxford internet institute and other it ventures giles died unexpectedly seventeen and i have learned to live without his need of me philanthropy is all that i do now i need never worry about getting lost because several charities would quickly come and find me but as many people in this room will know making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy and determination the courage to risk family and home and a so it 's just as well that i 'm a workaholic i believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility work is not just something i do when i 'd rather be doing something else we live our lives forward so what has all that taught me i learned though i 'm told i 'm"
