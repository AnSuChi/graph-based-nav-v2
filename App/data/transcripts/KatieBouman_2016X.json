  "transcript": "this a real photograph but a computer graphic rendering an artistic interpretation of what a black hole might look like a hundred years ago albert einstein first published his theory of general relativity in the years since then scientists have provided a lot of evidence in support of it still have not been directly observed you might be surprised to know getting this first picture will come down to an international team of scientists an earth sized telescope and an algorithm that puts together the final picture although i won 't be able to show you a real picture of a black hole today i 'd like to give you a brief glimpse into the effort involved in getting that first picture but although i 'm not an astronomer today i 'd like to show you how i 've been and if you could zoom past millions of stars thousand light years toward the heart of the spiraling milky way we 'd eventually reach a cluster of stars right at the center but it 's what they don 't see that is the most spectacular these stars seem to orbit an invisible astronomers have concluded that the only thing small and heavy enough to cause this motion is a supermassive black hole an object so dense that it sucks up anything that ventures too close even light it turns out that if we were to zoom in at radio wavelengths we 'd expect to see a ring of light caused by the gravitational of hot plasma zipping around the black hole this bright ring reveals the black hole 's event horizon so taking a picture of it wouldn 't only be really cool it would also help to verify that these equations hold this black hole is so far away from us that from earth this ring appears incredibly small the same size to us as an orange on the surface of the moon that makes taking a picture of it extremely difficult there are fundamental limits to the smallest objects that we can possibly see but even with the most powerful optical telescopes here on earth we can 't even get close to the resolution necessary to image on the surface of the moon in fact here i show one of the highest resolution images ever taken of the moon from earth it contains roughly thirteen thousand pixels so how big of a telescope do we need in order to see an orange on the surface of the moon and by extension our black hole well it turns out that by crunching the numbers you can easily calculate that we would need a telescope the size of the entire earth laughter if we could build this we could just start to make out that distinctive ring of light indicative of the black hole 's event horizon although this picture wouldn 't contain all the detail we see in computer graphic renderings but in the famous words of mick jagger you can 't always get what you want but if you try sometimes you just might find you get what you need capable of resolving this network of telescopes is scheduled to take its very first picture of a black hole next year linked through the precise timing of atomic clocks teams of researchers at each of the sights freeze light by collecting thousands of terabytes of data remember if we want to see the black hole in the center of our galaxy we need to build this impossibly large earth sized telescope let 's pretend we could build a telescope the the earth this would be a little bit like turning the earth into a giant spinning disco ball now let 's say we remove most of those mirrors so only a few remained we could still try to combine this information together but now there are a lot of holes these remaining mirrors represent the locations where we have telescopes this is an incredibly small number of measurements to make a picture from but although we only collect we get to see other new measurements as the disco ball spins those mirrors change locations and we get to observe different parts of the image the imaging algorithms we develop fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball in order to reconstruct the underlying black hole image if we had telescopes located everywhere on the globe in other words the entire disco ball this would be trivial not all images are created equal and so my role in helping to take the first image of a black hole is to design algorithms that find the most reasonable image that also fits the telescope measurements just as a forensic sketch artist uses limited descriptions to piece together a picture using their knowledge of face structure the imaging algorithms i develop use our limited telescope data to guide us to a picture that that also looks like stuff in our universe using these algorithms we 're able to so here i show a sample reconstruction although this is just a simulation reconstruction such as this give us hope that we 'll soon be able to reliably take the first image of a black hole and from it determine the size of its ring although i 'd love to go on about all the details luckily for you i don 't have the time but i 'd still like to give you a brief idea of how we define what our universe looks like and how we use this to reconstruct and verify our results we have to choose between them in some way so what do i mean by this exactly 's say we were trying to make a model that told us how likely an image were to appear on facebook and pretty likely that someone would post a selfie like this one on the right the image in the middle is blurry so even though it 's more likely we 'd see it on facebook compared to the noise image it 's probably less likely we 'd see it compared to the selfie but when it comes to images from the black hole with a real conundrum we 've never seen a black hole before we could try to use images from simulations we 've done like the image of the black hole from interstellar but if we did this it could could cause some serious problems we 'd still want to reconstruct an accurate picture of what was going on einstein 's equations too much into our algorithms we 'll just end up seeing what we expect to see we want to leave the option open for there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy laughter different types of images have very distinct features we can easily tell the difference between black hole simulation images and images we take every day here on we need a way to tell our algorithms what images look like without imposing one type of image 's features too much one way we can try to get around this is by imposing the features of different kinds of images and seeing how the type of image we assume affects our reconstructions if all images ' types produce a very similar looking image then we can start to become more confident that the image assumptions we 're making are not biasing little bit like giving the same description to three different sketch artists from all around the world if they all produce a very similar looking face then we can start to become confident that they 're not imposing their own cultural biases on the drawings so we take a large collection of images we then can treat each image patch a little bit like pieces of a puzzle and we use commonly seen puzzle pieces to piece together an image that also fits our telescope measurements so what happens when we take the same data but we use different sets of puzzle pieces to reconstruct the image great we see the same image such as the ones derived from everyday images and use them to reconstruct many different kinds of source images so in our simulations we pretend a black hole looks like astronomical non black hole objects so an image of a black hole we 've never seen before cats and dogs imaging ideas like this will make it possible for us to take our very first pictures of a black hole getting imaging ideas like this working would never have been possible without the amazing team of researchers that i have the privilege to work with mathematicians this is what will make it soon possible to achieve something once thought impossible thank you"
