  "transcript": "but it 's if you put that word into the web as you may have done you and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you something to make you irresistible and the molecules they mention sound really you must imagine that there is fantastic science behind this but sadly these are fraudulent claims supported by dodgy science the problem and they 're publishing in respectable journals at the basis of this despite very sophisticated experiments there really is no good science behind it because it 's based on a problem which is nobody has systematically gone through all the odors that humans produce now that 's not to say that smell is not important to people it is and some people are real enthusiasts and one of these empress josephine saying don 't wash i 'm coming home and it is still you 'll find websites that offer this as a major and perfumes are so what i want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you about what pheromones really are tell you why i think we would expect tell you about some of the confusions so the ancient greeks knew that dogs sent invisible signals between each other a female dog in heat sent an invisible signal to male dogs for miles around but the problem for everybody who could see this effect was that you couldn 't identify the molecules you couldn 't demonstrate it was chemical and it was only in one and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth but he created the model for how you should go he basically went through systematically showing that only the molecule in question was the one that stimulated the males not all the others and then tried the synthesized molecule on the males and got them to respond and showed it was indeed that molecule that 's closing the circle no real demonstration and that was the word pheromone and since one thousand nine so we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom what about humans well the first thing of course is that but the real reason we might think that humans have pheromones is the change that occurs as we grow up the smell of a room of teenagers is quite different from the smell of a room of small children what 's changed and of course it 's puberty along with the pubic hair and the hair in the armpits new glands start to secrete in those places but there are some problems and this is why i think people have not there are and the first of these is perhaps surprising it 's all about culture but humans do but gradually we learn what 's not good and one of the things we learn at the same time as what is not good liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries every culture has its own special food and national delicacy but they form almost a badge of identity you 're part of the in group the second thing is each of us has a unique odor world in the sense that what and the nobel prize awarded to richard axel and linda buck was only awarded in two thousand and four but in essence nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose the outside air are receptors and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain if you 're a human you have about four hundred different kinds of sending messages up to the brain in a combinatorial fashion so we each have an individual world and i have to say that i do have particularly good ones now i 'm not going to share them with you there is one good reason which is the great apes have armpits as their unique characteristic the great apes have these armpits full of secretory glands producing smells all the time enormous numbers of molecules and it the wonderful bacteria growing on the rainforest of hair that actually produces the smells that we know and love and so incidentally if you want to reduce the amount of smell clear cutting your armpits is a very effective way of reducing the habitat for bacteria and you 'll there is actually another reason why we might not be looking for a universal sex pheromone there and that 's because twenty percent of the world 's population they simply don 't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce so so what should we be doing like everybody we need to search and go for the first time where no one else has dared tread it 's going to be embarrassing but we need to look we also need to go back to the ideas that it isn 't good enough simply to pluck a couple and say they 'll do we have to actually demonstrate that they really have the effects we claim and their previous success was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone but what you 'll notice and that 's the secretion from the areolar glands now we all have them and if you 're a lactating woman these start to secrete it 's a very interesting secretion what benoist schaal and his team developed was a simple test to investigate what the effect of this secretion might be in effect we 've put a clean glass rod it can be from any mother we get a very different reaction and it opens its mouth and sticks out its tongue and starts to suck now it 's because women vary in the number of areolar glands that they have and there is a correlation between the ease with which babies start to suckle you have to get that first and if you don 't get it if we could identify what that molecule was synthesize it it would then mean premature babies would be more likely to there could be all sorts of medical interventions there could be all sorts of things that humans are doing with pheromones that we simply don 't know at the moment what we need to remember is pheromones are not just about sex they 're about all sorts of things to do with a mammal 's life so do go forward and do search for more there 's lots to find thank you very much"
