  "transcript": "unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth but perhaps surprising to you it 's also part of the good news we 're the first generation thanks to science to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability ability of planet earth to support human development as we know it it in fact we 're in a phase where transformative change is necessary which opens the window for innovation for new ideas and new paradigms a stakeholder who refuses to compromise planet earth so i thought i 'd bring her with me today on stage to have her as a witness of which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we 've had over the past ten thousand years this is the living conditions on the planet over the last one hundred thousand years it 's a very important period it 's roughly half the period when we 've been fully modern humans on the planet we 've had the same roughly abilities that developed civilizations as we know it this is the environmental conditions on the planet here used as a proxy we colonize australia in another crisis sixty thousand years back we leave asia for europe in another crisis that we know of that can support human development a thousand years into this period we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns we go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people you have the roman the greek and the story as you know it the only phase as we know it that can support humanity the trouble is we 're putting a quadruple sqeeze on a quadruple sqeeze which as its first squeeze has a momentous pressure the second pressure on the planet is of course the climate agenda the big issue where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at four hundred and fifty ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees holding six meters level rising the risk of destabilizing the greenland ice sheet holding another seven meters sea level rising a resilient planet but unfortunately the third pressure one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term in our forests land and biodiversity the forth pressure is surprise the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old in our so to say linear systems and that in fact surprise is universal as systems tip over very rapidly abruptly and often irreversibly this dear friends poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale we may in fact have entered a new geological era the anthropocene where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level now as a scientist ample it you can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well being nitrous oxide methane deforestation overfishing land degredation loss of species they all show the same pattern over the past two hundred years simultaneously they branch off in the mid 50s ten years after the second world war and i can tell you you enter the disciplinary research in each of these you find something remarkably important the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves the decade when we have to bend the curves now as if this was not enough to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states separated by thresholds illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram erosion biodiversity loss changing state loses its resilience soft corals take over we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development the arctic appearing to be in a good state no scientist could predict that in two thousand and the system suddenly very surprisingly loses thirty to forty percent of its summer ice cover because it changes color absorbs more energy and the system may get stuck in my mind the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation as a sideline you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the arctic to be able to control the oil resources if we have evidence which we now have that wetlands forests [ unclear ] monsoon system the rainforests behave in this nonlinear way thirty or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time do we have to put the planet into the the pot so we have to ask ourselves are we threatening this extraordinarily stable holocene state are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we 're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired if now catastrophic change you don 't want to stand there in fact you 're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing at the foaming slippery waters at the threshold in fact there 's a fence quite upstream of this threshold beyond which you are in a danger zone and this is the new paradigm which we gathered two three years aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts is of the past now we to ask ourselves which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the holocene and could we even thanks to major advancements in earth systems science identify the thresholds the points where we may and could we even define a planetary boundary a fence within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity this work which was published in nature late two thousand and nine led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which under active stewardship would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space these include of course climate it may surprise you that it 's not only climate but it shows that we are interconnected among many systems on the planet with the three big systems climate change stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems where the scientific evidence of large scale but we also include what we call the slow variables the systems that under the hood regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet land use change rate of biodiversity loss freshwater use functions which regulate and then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify air pollution including understanding that the planet is a complex self regulating system most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three you undermine the ability of the climate system if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development now this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries what you see here in black line is the safe operating space the quantified the yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point the pre industrial point where we 're very safely in the safe operating space in the ' 50s we start branching out haber bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere you know human 's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole right after rio and today we are in a situation where we estimate that we 've transgressed three boundaries the rate of biodiversity loss which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs degrees of freedom on the others but we are approaching fast on land water phosphorus and oceans but this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity to put the light on our so far overpowered industrial vehicle which operates as if we 're only on a dark straight highway now the question then is how gloomy is this is then sustainable development utopia there 's no science to suggest in fact there is that we have the ability but it changes fundamentally looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible a much more adaptive approach where we recognize that redundancy both in social and environmental systems is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change we have to invest in persistence in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis and of course to adapt and the list can start becoming longer and longer there 's good news here for example from latin america where farming systems of the ' 50s and ' 60s brazil leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted in some countries have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch zero till farming which not only produces more food but also sequesters carbon the australian great barrier reef is another success story under the realization from the australian great barrier reef authority and scientists that the great barrier reef is doomed under the current governance regime but the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole and then allow for much more redundancy in the system sweden the country i come from has other examples where wetlands in southern sweden were seen as as in many countries as these into a key component of sustainable urban planning so crisis leading into opportunities well the future of course has one massive challenge which is feeding a world of nine billion people we need nothing less than a new green revolution and the planet boundaries shows that it has to basically do this on current land we cannot continue consuming water interestingly and based on my work and others in africa for example we 've shown that even the most vulnerable small scale rainfall farming systems with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers ' fields and innovations in tillage systems we can triple quadruple yield levels on current land the latest nobel laureate of economics clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in and what shall we do everybody talks about carbon taxes it won 't work emission schemes but for example one policy measure feed in tariffs on the energy system which is already applied from china doing it on offshore wind systems all the way to the u s where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy but you can subsidize electricity to poor people you get people out of poverty no doubt opportunity here and we can list the key though in all of these the red thread is where we instead backcast our future so there is scientific evidence they sort of say the harsh news that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization in fact what we have to do over the next forty years is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we 're in today collaborating on a global level from thank you"
