  "transcript": "you live on a small farm in the philippines your animals are your family 's sole source of income as long as they 're healthy you know one of your pigs can catch the flu the swine flu living in tight quarters one pig coughing and sneezing may soon lead to the next pig coughing and sneezing until an outbreak of swine flu has taken over your farm if it 's a bad enough virus the health of your herd may be gone in the blink of an eye but then they would have to drive back into the city to test those samples in their central lab farmers can take those samples themselves they can jump right into the pen and swab their pigs ' noses and mouths with a little filter paper place that little filter paper in a tiny tube and and without leaving their farms they take a drop of that genetic material and put it into a little analyzer smaller than a shoebox program it to detect dna or rna from the swine flu virus and within one hour get back the results visualize the results this reality is possible because today we 're living in the era of personal dna technology every one of us can actually test dna ourselves dna is the fundamental molecule the carries genetic instructions that help build the living world humans have dna pigs have dna even bacteria and some viruses have dna too the genetic instructions grow function and in many cases that same information can trigger disease but the lines that carry meaningful information are usually very short a few dozen to several thousand letters long so when we 're looking to answer a question based on dna we actually don 't need to read all those three billion letters typically pausing at every line just to find the nearest pizza joint laughter luckily humans started to invent tools that can find any specific line of genetic information these dna machines are wonderful they can find does my pig have the flu am i of irish descent is that to make copies of dna as simple as it sounds has transformed our world scientists use it every day to detect and address disease to create innovative medicines to modify foods to assess whether our food is safe to eat or whether it 's contaminated with even judges use the output of these machines in court to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty based on dna evidence the inventor of this dna copying technique was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in or bigwig phd scientist work well several companies around the world are working on making this same technology accessible to everyday people like the pig farmer like you i cofounded one of these companies we decided to make personal dna machines that anyone could use our goal was to bring dna science to more people in new places we started working in our basements we had a simple question what could the world look like if everyone could analyze dna we were curious as curious as you would have been if i had shown you this picture in one thousand nine hundred and eighty i can little did you know you would tap on that phone to make dinner reservations for you and aunt glenda to celebrate together with another tap you 'd be ordering her gift and yet one more tap and you 'd be liking auntie glenda on facebook and all of this while sitting on the toilet laughter it is notoriously hard to predict where new technology might take us and the same is true for personal i could never have imagined that a truffle farmer of all people would use personal dna machines dr paul thomas holding the first truffle in his hands on one of his he 's exposed to the threat of knockoffs but they 're of lower quality so in order to grow the highest quality truffles the ones that chefs all over the world will fight over paul has to use dna analysis isn 't that mind blowing i bet you will never look at that black truffle risotto again without thinking of its genes but professor ian goodfellow is a virologist last year he traveled to sierra leone when the ebola outbreak broke out in western africa he quickly realized that doctors there lacked the basic tools to detect and combat disease ian decided to move his lab into makeni sierra leone here we see ian goodfellow moving over ten tons of equipment into a pop up tent that he would equip to detect and diagnose the virus and sequence it within but here 's a surprise the same equipment that ian could use at his lab in the uk to sequence and diagnose ebola but instead ian could use personal dna machines small enough to be let 's talk about dna analysis in space they 're traveling at seventeen thousand miles per hour picture that floating and under these conditions our bodies can do funky things one of these things is that our immune systems get suppressed making astronauts more prone to infection girl a high school student from new york and through a science competition called genes in space anna sophia designed an experiment to test this international space station that cloud of smoke is the rocket that brought anna sophia 's experiment to the international space station astronaut tim peake carried out her experiment in microgravity personal dna machines are now aboard the international space station where they can help monitor living conditions and protect the lives of astronauts a well to me it signals something bigger that dna technology is finally within the reach of every one of you a few years ago a college student armed with a personal computer could code an app an app that is now a social network with more than one billion users could we be moving into a world of one personal dna machine in every home i know families who are already living in this reality the daniels family for example set up a dna lab in the basement of their suburban chicago home this is not a family made of phd scientists brian is an executive at a private equity firm as a way to explore the living world mixing it with chemicals to extract dna and then using their home dna copier to test those tomatoes for genetically engineered traits for the daniels family the personal dna machine is like most of us may not yet be diagnosing genetic conditions in our kitchen sinks or doing at home paternity testing but we 've definitely reached a point in history where every one of you could actually get hands on with dna in your kitchen you could copy paste and analyze dna and extract meaningful information from it and it 's at times like this that finally becomes within the reach of every one of us think about the moment when phones stopped being plugged into the wall by cords or when computers left the mainframe and entered your so if you 're curious get up close and personal with dna today it is in our dna to be curious"
