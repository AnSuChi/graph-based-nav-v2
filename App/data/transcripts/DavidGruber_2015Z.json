  "transcript": "but i want to share a secret totally incorrect i see a couple of people crying in the back that i 've blown their idea of mermaids but anyone who 's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this and as soon as you start going underwater you 're going to lose your colors and it 's going to get dark and blue very quickly but we 're humans we 're terrestrial and we try to bring this eye popping color underwater with us so there 's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater and it starts eighty eight years ago with bill longley and charles martin who were trying to take the scuba suits where you 're pumping air down to them and they 've got a pontoon of magnesium powder and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they 're going to pull the string when they 've got their frame in focus and boom a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful they 're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color and looking at it the other way what we 've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us and it 's a crucible of blue and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to and here 's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like it 's like an underwater light show these animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light so if you think about it the ocean percent of the planet so if you see anything under ten meters that 's red it 's an animal transforming and creating its own red biofluorescence begins with corals and i want to give a full ted talk on corals and just how cool these things are one of the things that they do one of their miraculous feats is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins fluorescent molecules and in this coral it could be making up to fourteen percent of its body mass could be this fluorescent protein so you wouldn 't be making like fourteen percent muscle and not using it so it 's likely doing something that has a functional role and for the last ten fifteen years and it 's allowing us to better see inside ourselves how do i study this so i could make sure i 'm actually seeing the light that 's being transformed by the animals we 're making an exhibit for the museum of natural history and we 're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef and something happened that just blew me away this in the middle of our corals is this green fluorescent fish it 's the first time we 've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter and we 're rubbing our eyes checking the filters thinking that somebody 's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera it was the first green fluorescent eel that we found and this just changed my trajectory completely so i had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist john sparks and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent and some of the fish even have the way that i was photographing and it 's a bit like e t phone home we 're out there swimming swimming with this blue light and we 're looking for a response for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us and that full moon night translates underwater to blue perhaps they 're using this as a way to see each other quickly find each other mate go back into for the next long stint of time but then we started to find other fluorescent marine life like this green fluorescent bream with its like racing stripes along along its head and its nape and it 's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there after this fish we were introduced to this red fluorescent cloaked and hidden on this rock the only time we 've ever seen this it 's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral later we found this stealthy green but if you look at them under fluorescent light you see lots of patterns you can really see the differences among them and in total we just reported this last year we found over two hundred species of biofluorescent fish one of my inspirations is french artist and biologist and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth so this is the male seahorse they were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head the males give birth just phenomenal creatures so he could capture and here 's our footage they would blend right into the algae but they 've got great vision and they go through this long mating ritual and perhaps they 're using it in that effect but things got pretty edgy when we found green so i 'm like a coral biologist somebody 's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent and there i am and i was like maybe i should go back to corals laughter it turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent and then we found it in a deep dark canyon off the coast of california we found the first right underneath all the surfers here it is they 're just about a meter long and here is our first footage of these but this is all beautiful to see i was like this is gorgeous but and nothing was known about this shark probably about one hundred times better than we can see in the dark but they only see blue green and males and females i encountered the first which so it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they 're still here and understand them i wanted to know how deep does it go does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean so we started and we dropped down and we noticed one important thing that it drops off there 's no biofluorescent marine life down there below one thousand meters almost nothing it 's just darkness and below one thousand meters we encountered the bioluminescent zone where nine out of ten animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking as i try to get deeper this is slapping on a one person submarine suit some people call this my jacques cousteau meets woody allen moment laughter but as we explore down here i was thinking about how do we interact with life delicately because we 're entering a new age of exploration and we 've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there the idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military 're not really caring to be gentle some corals could be one thousand years old you don 't and i could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars and we can conduct our research back to the powerful applied applications here you 're looking at a living brain that 's using the dna of fluorescent marine creatures so he could see when a single neuron fires you 're essentially and we 're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind and it 's my hope"
