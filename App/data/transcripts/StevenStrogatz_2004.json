  "transcript": "how is sync connected to happiness and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing and so if you 'll put up with this i would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today the experiment is and i notice by the way that when you applauded that you did it in a typical north american way that is you were raucous and incoherent it didn 't even occur to you to clap in unison do you think you could do it i would like to you haven 't practiced as far as i know can you get it together to clap in sync whoa now that 's what we call emergent behavior it 's interesting this is a room full of intelligent people highly sensitive some trained musicians out there is that what enabled you to synchronize so to put the question a little more seriously let 's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did for spontaneous synchronization do you need for instance to be as smart as you are do you even need a brain at all do you need to be alive it 's real in fact it extends from the subatomic scale it 's a deep tendency toward order in nature that that and so that 's our theme now to get into that which is the the glorious example of birds or fish swimming in organized schools so these are not particularly intelligent creatures and yet as we 'll see they exhibit beautiful ballets this is from a bbc show called avoid predators to confuse predators let me be quiet for a second could be possible we 're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony these creatures are not choreographed they 're choreographing themselves and only today is science starting to figure out how it works i 'll show you a computer model made by iain couzin a researcher at oxford that shows how swarms work there are just three simple rules second all the individuals have a tendency to line up but they try to keep a small distance apart and when you build those three rules in automatically you start to see swarms that look very much like fish schools or or bird flocks now fish like to stay close together about a body length apart birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart but except for that difference the rules are the same for both now all this changes when a predator enters there 's a fourth rule when a predator 's coming get out of the way here on the model you see the predator attacking the prey move out in random directions and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again and you see that in nature keep in mind that although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate what 's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian is scattering away at random to try to save its scales that is out of the desire to save itself each creature is following these rules and that leads to something that 's safe for all of them even though it looks like they 're thinking as a group might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm so you can think of several as i say if there are many in the example with the starlings with the birds when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them that actually waves of panic can propagate sending messages over great distances you 'll see let 's see it 's coming up possibly at the very end maybe yes it 's happening here see if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm it 's beautiful the birds are are we sort of understand we think from that computer model what 's going on as i say it 's just those three simple rules plus the one about watch out for predators we would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works and to understand you know exactly where this organization comes from how do the rules give rise to the there is one case that we have begun to understand better and it 's the case of fireflies but in southeast asia places like thailand or malaysia or borneo there 's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies you can see it every night along the river banks the trees mangrove trees are filled with fireflies communicating with light specifically it 's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together in perfect synchrony mate with me you can get a sense this is a single frame then on and then off and watch how precise the synchrony is on more on and then off the combined light from these beetles these are actually tiny beetles is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers no one believed them we don 't see anything like this in europe or in the west or you know a human being 's tendency to see patterns where there are none but i hope you 've convinced yourself now with this nighttime video that they really were very well you don 't have to be a whole creature you can even be just a single cell like take for instance your pacemaker cells in your heart right now they 're keeping you alive every beat of your heart which has about ten thousand independent cells that would each beep have an electrical rhythm a voltage up and down your pacemaker is not a single cell it 's this democracy of ten thousand cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly there is an instance of billions of brain cells discharging in pathological concert so this tendency towards order is not always a good thing you don 't have to be alive you don 't have to be even a single cell if you look for instance at how lasers work that would be a case of atomic synchrony in a laser what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here is that this light is incoherent many different colors and different frequencies sort of like the way you clapped initially it would be rhythmic applause it would be all atoms pulsating in unison emitting light of one color one frequency which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize this is not keith barry doing a magic trick this is a klutz just playing with some water bottles i have some metronomes here can you hear that it 's the world 's smallest metronome the and i 'm going to now take another one set to the same setting there 's no reason for them to synchronize and they probably won what i 'm hoping is that they might just drift apart because their frequencies aren 't perfectly the same right they did they were in sync for a while but then they drifted apart and the reason is that they 're not able to communicate now you might think that 's a bizarre idea how can metronomes communicate which is the guide to graduate study at cornell here it is let 's see if we can get this to work my wife pointed out to me that it will work better if i put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over let 's see ok i 'm not trying to cheat let me start them out of sync no hard to even do that but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order and a clear case of that was something that happened in london in the year two thousand the millennium bridge was supposed to be the pride of london a beautiful new there was a big and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team in the ted spirit actually of an architect perhaps the greatest architect in the united kingdom lord norman foster and an engineering firm and together they submitted a design based on making a blade of light and then scamper across on this blade of light he said that 's the vision i want to give to london i want a blade of light across the thames so they built the and it 's a very thin ribbon of steel the world 's probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is with cables that are out on the side you 're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top these cables were on the side of the bridge like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the thames that 's what 's holding up this bridge everyone was very excited to try it out on opening day thousands of londoners came out and something happened so i want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day who will describe what happened could definitely there was something going on sideways it felt maybe at least six six to eight inches deliberately push your feet out sideways and or anything like that man no they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge steven strogatz all right so that already gives you a hint of what happened think of the bridge as being like this platform think of the people as being like you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome but after all we do and especially if we start to walk like those people did right they all showed this strange but also after you see the bridge on opening day you 'll see an interesting clip of work done by a bridge engineer at cambridge named allan mcrobie who figured out what happened on the bridge and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was it was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move that engineers knew nothing about actually i think the first person you 'll see is the we 'd checked it to codes to heavier loads than the codes and here it was doing something that but how could the crowd become synchronized was there something special about the millennium bridge that caused this effect this was to be the focus of the investigation allan mcrobie is a bridge engineer from cambridge who wrote to me suggesting that a bridge simulator to wobble in the same way as the real bridge provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length am this one 's only a couple of tons so it 's fairly easy to get going just by walking interviewer well it 's certainly going now am it doesn 't have to be a real dangle just walk it starts to go interviewer it 's actually quite difficult to walk you have to be careful where you put your feet down don 't you because if you get it wrong it just throws you off your feet am it certainly affects the way you walk normally on it interviewer so already the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our witnesses walked on the real bridge it 's really intriguing because but then of course everyone is driving the bridge and therefore to drive it to move further ss all right well with that from the i see i 've gone over but i hope that you 'll go outside and see the the world in a new way to see all the amazing synchrony around us thank you"
