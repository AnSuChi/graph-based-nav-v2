  "transcript": "and it was the now director of the entire piece of the 's administration who himself had lost an arm thirty nine years ago in vietnam and it turns out that with sixty minutes cameras rolling in the background after he pretty much made his position clear on this he had his hook and he had his he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that quote his quote and i 'm not going to show you that polished video i 'm going to instead in a minute or two show you an early crude video because better way to tell a story a few years ago i was visited by the guy that runs darpa the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities i get this sort of unrequested by me anyway visit and sitting in my conference room we have used such advanced technologies now and made them available they will have brought him back they will be getting world class triage emergency care faster than you and i would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the united states that 's the good the bad news is if they 've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm part of the face it 's probably not coming back at the end of the civil war they were shooting each other with muskets if somebody lost an arm we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it and they basically said this is unacceptable and then the punchline so dean we 're here because you make medical stuff you 're going to give us an arm and i was waiting for the five hundred pages if it 's the grape they won 't break it great he needs efferent afferent haptic response sensors if it flex at the wrist flex at the elbow abduct and flex at the shoulder either way they were going to eat it 50th percentile female frame namely thirty two inches from the long finger and weigh less than nine pounds 50th percentile female frame and it 's going to be completely self contained including all its power i told them they 're nuts they 've been watching too much terminator you need to know more than two dozen of these kids have come back bilateral imagine i 'm sorry you may have a better imagination than i do i can 't imagine losing my arm and typically at twenty two years old anyway i went i decided we 've got to do this but i figured i gotta do this did a little investigation went down to washington told them i still think they 're nuts but we 're going to do it and i i told them it would probably take five years to get through the fda and probably ten years to be reasonably functional look what it takes to make things like ipods you an arm that 's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year it will take the other nine to make it functional and useful we sort of agreed to disagree i went back and i started putting a team together the best guys i could find with a passion to do this at the end of exactly one year we had a device with fourteen degrees of all the sensors all the microprocessors all the stuff inside i could show you it with a cosmesis on it that 's so real it 's eerie but then you wouldn 't see all this cool stuff it turned out as i think you could see in aimee 's capabilities and attitudes people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite anyway with less than ten hours of use two guys one that 's bilateral he 's literally he 's got no shoulder on one side and he 's high trans humeral on the other and that 's chuck and randy together after ten hours were playing in our office and we took some pretty cruddy home movies at the end of the one i 'm going to show it 's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long holds the spoon level as he translates it moving all these joints simultaneously and he doesn 't drop any milk i cannot do that chuck hasn 't fed himself in nineteen years so you 've got a can we see that this is chuck showing simultaneous control of all the joints he 's punching our controls guy the guy behind him is our engineer convenient guy to have around there 's randy these guys are passing and just as in the spirit of first gracious professionalism they are quite proud of this so they decide to share a drink this is a non trivial thing to do by the way imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it doing either of those now chuck is doing something quite extraordinary at least for my limited physical skill and now he 's going to do what darpa asked me for he 's going to pick up a grape he didn 't drop it he didn 't break it so that 's where we were at the end of about fifteen as i 've learned from the technology the processors the sensors the motors i hadn 't dealt with this kind of problem this whole segment of the medical world i 'll give you some astounding things that have happened the weight the size the cost the functionality i put a bunch of guys my plane and i said we 're flying down to walter reed and we 're going talk to these kids because frankly it doesn 't matter whether we like this arm it doesn 't matter whether the department of defense likes this arm when i told them that they weren 't entirely enthusiastic but the kids that are either going to use it or not i told a bunch of my engineers look we 're going to walk into walter reed and you 're going to see people lots of them missing major body parts depressed frustrated we 're probably going to have to give them support encouragement but we 've got to extract from them enough information to make sure we 're doing the right thing we walked into walter reed and i could not have been more we did see a bunch of people a lot of them missing a lot of body parts and parts they had left were burned half a face gone an ear burned off they were sitting at a table they were brought together for us and we started asking them all questions i can give you fast control with and we were trying to get them to all help us not only were they enthusiastic they kept thinking they 're there to help us well would it help if i we need to know what you need i called down to the end hey you haven 't said much if we needed this or this what would you but i 'm a lefty so he wouldn 't say much he had a great spirit like all the rest of them had great spirits he has no legs and i was thinking they 're not finished giving yet it was astounding went back and i started working harder faster and it was astounding how positive they are so we went back and we 've and i get a call and we go back to washington twenty some odd days before that and they shipped him to germany and twenty four hours later they shipped him from germany to walter reed and he was there and they said we needed to come and i went down and they rolled him into a room half of his face is gone but they said his he had one good eye marrocco and he said but i need two of them you 'll get them this kid was from and it had a stick you think i 'll be able to drive it sure and i turned around and went how are we going to do this he doesn 't really want a lot he wants to help he told me that he wanted to go back i was on my way out here i was asked to stop at texas there were three thousand five hundred people the veteran 's administration u s just three thousand five hundred at this huge event to help the families of all the kids some that have died some that are like brandon and they wanted me to speak i said what am i going to say this is not a happy thing look if this happens to you i can give you this stuff is still not as good at the original equipment you need to come so i went and as i think you get the point but universally these people that and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them i don 't think anybody does it intentionally but there were people there literally talking about well how much will they get you know this country is involved as we 've all heard in this great healthcare debate who is entitled to what who is entitled to how much who is going to pay for it i don 't have an answer to that not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here it 's not possible it would be nice but let 's be realistic they were tough questions there 's polarized groups down there i don 't know the answers there are other questions that are tough should we be be there how do we get out what do we need to do there 's very polarized answers to that question too and i don 't have any answers i don 't have the answer but let me give you a simple concern or maybe statement then it is an easy i know what these kids deserve and he was really liking this arm it 's way way way better than a plastic but i was saying to him you know the first airplane went one hundred feet in one thousand nine hundred and three wilbur and orville but but now we got eagles out there f15s even that bald eagle i 've never seen a bird flying around at mach two i think eventually we 'll make these things extraordinary i said to that kid i 'll stop when your buddies are envious of your luke arm and i 'm not going to stop working until we do that"
