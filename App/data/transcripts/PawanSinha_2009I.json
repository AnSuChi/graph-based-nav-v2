  "transcript": "if you are a blind child in india you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news the first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none and that 's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults and there are very very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from rajasthan illustrates and instead of suggesting to the caretakers the person decided to burn her abdomen with red hot iron bars the second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age that even if you have your eye corrected the chances of your brain learning how to see are very very slim so when both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons but it 's sincere that 's my son darius as a new father i have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel a child i would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment so that 's the personal reason scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods that if the brain is it loses its ability to learn that doesn 't sit well with me because i don 't think the birth of the idea is from david hubel and torsten wiesel 's work two researchers who were at harvard and they got the nobel prize in but i believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely so they did their work with kittens with different kinds of deprivation regiments and those studies which date back to the ' 60s are now being applied to human children so i felt that i needed to do two things to children who are currently being deprived of treatment that 's the humanitarian mission and the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity and these two missions to implement these twin missions a few years ago i launched project prakash prakash as many of you know is the sanskrit word for light and the idea is that in bringing light into into the lives of children we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience and the logo it 's actually derived from the indian the overall effort has three components outreach to identify children in need of care and in subsequent study and i want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components because this is a school for the blind many children have permanent conditions that 's a case of microphthalmos and that 's a permanent condition it cannot be treated that 's an extreme of but every so often we come across children who show some residual vision and that is a very good sign the schroff charity eye hospital it has a very well equipped pediatric ophthalmic center eating burgers actually helps but in this child the lens has become opaque and therefore he can 't see the the child is given treatment you 'll see shots of the eye here 's the eye with the opaque lens the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted and here 's the same child three weeks post operation with the right eye open and we have now the child gains significant functionality the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation we did a paper a few years ago about i should add a tragic postscript postscript to this she died hers is just a truly inspiring story unknown but inspiring story when we started finding these results as you might imagine it created quite a bit of stir here 's an article in nature that profiled this work and another one in time despite extended visual deprivation the next obvious question to ask what is the process of recovery so the way we study that is the child is provided treatment and i want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional there is no quid pro quo we treat many more children then we actually work with every child who needs treatment is treated after treatment about every week we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests and we try to do this for as long as possible this arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up what might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones so any image of the kind that you see on the left be it a real image or a synthetic image it 's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column regions of different colors different luminances the brain has this complex task here what happens very soon after the onset of sight here running the experiment with him but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he 's trying to trace out if you show him real world images if you show others like him real world images when you ask them even if you can 't name the objects just point to where the objects are these are the regions that they point to so the world is is this complex patchwork of regions even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object interestingly enough you give them a few months it 's a profound question and what 's even more amazing is how simple the answer is the answer lies in motion and that 's what i want to show you in the next clip the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information so the inference we are deriving from this and several such experiments is that dynamic serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing it leads to and let me just quickly mention two goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system can we use this as a recipe and that 's what we 're trying to do i 'm at mit at mit you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain so we are which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive the way we test dylan is by giving it inputs as i said of the same kind that a baby or a child in project prakash would get but for for a long time we couldn 't quite figure out wow can we get these kinds of video inputs and that way get the inputs that we feed into dylan so that 's what we did i had to have long conversations with my wife babyies are born eight hundred so they are looking at the world in a very very blurry fashion here 's what a baby cam to go with this the baby very babies begin to pay attention to their mother 's or their father 's face how does that happen we want dylan to be able to do that and using this mantra of motion given that kind of video input with just about six or seven minutes worth of video dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces it 's an important demonstration of the power of motion could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism because if that hypothesis were to be true it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what 's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype what you 're going to see so while the child is playing pong we are tracking where they 're looking in red are the eye movement traces this is the neurotypical child and what you see the child is already looking there contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game instead of anticipating the child always follows where the ball has been the efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be so we are pursuing this line of of work and hopefully we 'll have more results to report soon looking ahead if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we 've treated so far this is the magnitude of the problem the red dots and in order to to expand the scope of the project we are planning on launching the prakash center for children which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital a school for the children we are treating education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts so to summarize prakash in its the development of autonomous machine vision systems education of the undergraduate and graduate students and most importantly and for my students and i it 's been just a phenomenal while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with thank you very much"
