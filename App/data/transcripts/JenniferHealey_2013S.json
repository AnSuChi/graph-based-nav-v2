  "transcript": "one of the things that we don 't like to think about but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages sixteen to nineteen in the united states leading cause of death so what and the car in front of me i saw the brake lights go on i 'm like okay all right this guy is slowing down i 'll slow down too i step on the brake i slammed on the brakes i felt the abs kick in and the car is still going and the air bag deploys the car is totaled and fortunately no one was hurt but and i think we can do a lot better than that i think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now get into your car close the door you 're in a glass bubble you can 't really directly sense the world around you you 're in this extended body you 're tasked with navigating it down partially seen roadways in and amongst other metal giants at super human okay so that 's all you have eyes that weren 't really designed for this task but then people ask you to do things like you want to make a lane change what 's the first thing they ask you do take your eyes off the road that 's right you and everyone else this is the safe way to why do we do this because we have to we have to make a choice do i look here but occasionally occasionally we sense something wrong or and i believe that i believe that we can only watch so much but the technology exists now that can help us improve that we will be able to see bird 's eye view will actually be able to see into those cars we will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us to see how fast that guy 's going or stopping if that guy 's going down to zero i 'll know and with computation and algorithms and predictive models we will be able to see the future you may think that 's impossible how can you predict the future that 's really hard actually no with cars it 's not impossible cars are three dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity they travel down roads often they travel on pre published routes it 's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions even if when you 're in your car and some motorcyclist comes bshoom hour down lane splitting i know you 've had this experience that guy didn 't just come out of nowhere that guy 's been on the road probably for the last half hour ten twenty thirty miles back someone 's seen that guy and as soon as one car sees that guy and puts him on the map he 's on the map position velocity because your car will know because that other car will have whispered something in his ear like by the way five minutes motorcyclist watch out you can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave i mean they 're newtonian objects that 's very nice about them we can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars just sharing gps if i have a gps and a camera in my car i have a pretty precise idea of where i am and how fast i 'm going and same with the other cars they can have a precise idea of where they are and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are what happens if two cars share that data if they talk to each other professor bob wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens even in light traffic when cars just share gps data and we 've moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now we also attach they track each other 's position precisely and they can avoid each other we 're now adding more and more robots into the mix so you have to prioritize and that 's where the predictive model helps you if your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories you don 't pay as much attention to those packets you prioritize the one guy and you can predict the new trajectory know that he 's going off course you know how and we wanted to do how can we best alert everyone how can these cars whisper you need to get out of the way well it depends on two things one the ability of the car and second the ability of the driver if one guy has a really great car we can detect if a driver is looking forward looking away looking down on the phone or having a cup of coffee we can predict the accident which cars are in the best position to move out of the way i think the biggest problem that that we face is our own willingness to share our data i think it 's a very disconcerting notion this idea that our cars will be watching us talking about us to other cars that we 'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip when i look at your car from the outside i don 't really know about you if i i believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs laughter and i think it 's going to be a great thing i want you to consider for a moment if you really don 't want the distracted teenager behind you so let your car gossip about you it"
