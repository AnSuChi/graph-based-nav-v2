  "transcript": "these gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was estimate that it was what we are showing here is is and i 'm showing dollars per person in income and the size of these bubbles the size of the bubbles here that shows how many are infected in each country and the color is the continent now you can see united states in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three had a very low percentage infected but due to the big population still a sizable bubble there were quite many people infected in and up there you see uganda they had almost five percent infected happened now you have understood the graph i have a new invention here the fast rise in uganda and zimbabwe they went upwards like this in asia the first country to be heavily infected was thailand they reached one to two percent then uganda started to turn back india got many infected but had a low level russia went to one percent in the last we have reached a steady state of hiv epidemic in the world and it has now let me make a democratic government they peaked up there in two thousand and three and now they are down but they are falling only slowly but the poorer countries in africa the low income countries down here there the rates fall faster of the percentage infected because people still die in spite of all people are not reached by treatment and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries only sixty percent are left on treatment after two years but it 's very good that what is done is being done but focus is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it drugs is too costly had we had the vaccine or when we will get the vaccine that 's something more effective but the drugs but the treatment and the care which is needed around it and you 'll find a lot of african countries about as low as the rest of and it 's not very clever to think that way i found out that salt lake city and san francisco were different and so it is in africa it 's a lot of difference and this is peaceful zambia neighboring country fifteen percent and there 's good studies of the refugees coming out of congo they have two three percent infected and peaceful zambia much higher the and it is even bigger among women so this is the difference within tanzania and i can 't avoid showing kenya look split kenya in its provinces here it goes and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries well it is more common with multiple partners there is less i will swap the bubbles to a map the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold fifty percent of the hiv infected brazil has many hiv infected arab countries not so much but iran is quite high they have heroin addiction and also prostitution in iran and so on but there is one part of africa and the difficult thing is at the same time not to make a uniform statement about africa not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this on one hand on the other it could be some virus types it could be that that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency after all if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in one thousand don 't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on but and if you are in an unfavorable situation more sexually transmitted diseases it can be one in one hundred but what we think is that it could be concurrency and what is concurrency vodka new year 's eve new partner for the spring vodka midsummer 's eve new partner for the fall vodka and it goes on and we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic and what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this and we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart we will not only have the money thank you very much"
