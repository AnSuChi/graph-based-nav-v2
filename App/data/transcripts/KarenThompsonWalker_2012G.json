  "transcript": "three thousand miles off the coast of chile in one of the most remote regions of the pacific ocean twenty american sailors watched their ship flood with seawater which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship the men huddled together in three small whaleboats these men were ten thousand miles from home more than one thousand miles from the nearest scrap of land in their small boats they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water whose story would later inspire parts of moby dick even in today 's but think about how much worse it would have been then no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong no search party was coming to look for these men but we all know what it 's like to be afraid we know how fear feels but i 'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean up we 're often encouraged to think of fear neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard wired to be optimists so maybe that 's why we think of fear sometimes as a danger in and of what if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself when i was a child i lived in california which is you know mostly a very nice place to live but for me as a child california could also be a little scary i remember how how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake and i sometimes couldn 't sleep at night terrified that the big one might strike while we were sleeping and what we say about kids who have fears like that is that that they have a vivid imagination but maybe it 's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults the same incredible imaginations that produced but they had very few options nathaniel philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on earth the men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the marquesas islands they 'd been told that these islands and several others nearby were populated by cannibals so the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner now the last option was the longest and the most difficult to sail but they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water to be eaten by cannibals to be battered by storms to starve to death before reaching land these were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men and as it turned out the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name and fears and storytelling have the same components they have the same architecture like all stories fears have characters in our fears the characters are us they have beginnings and middles and ends you board the plane the plane takes off the engine fails picture a cannibal human teeth sinking into human skin human flesh flesh roasting over a fire if i 've done my job as a storyteller today you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship essex our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature what will happen next and humans by the way are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way of projecting ourselves forward in time and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling as a writer i can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event story will affect all the other events when i was writing my first novel the age of miracles i spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the earth suddenly began to slow down what would happen to our days what would happen to our crops what would happen to our minds and then it was only later that i realized how very similar these questions were to the ones i used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night and the answer to those questions always took the form of a story but just as importantly we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called productive paranoia if their and sometimes of course our worst fears do come true but we can 't possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to they decided to forgo the closest islands the men herman melville who used this story as research for moby dick wrote years later and from dry land of these miserable men of the essex might in all human probability have been avoided but as melville put it they dreaded cannibals why did these men dread cannibals so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation the novelist vladimir nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments the artistic and the scientific but just as importantly the which acts to temper and complicate the reader 's intuitive reactions to the story the problem was that they listened to the wrong story of all the narratives their fears wrote they responded only to the most lurid the most vivid the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture cannibals just as melville 's sad commentary suggests an amazing act of the imagination"
