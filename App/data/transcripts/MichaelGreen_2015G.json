and here they are these goals are the product of a massive consultation exercise the global goals are who we humanity want to be but can we get there can this vision for a better world really be achieved and the answer is that maybe we actually can but not with business as usual now the idea that the world is going to get a better place may seem a little fanciful watch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards not forwards but please i invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment the millennium development goals and the flagship target there was to halve the proportion of people living in poverty by two thousand and fifteen the target was to take from a baseline of one thousand nine hundred and ninety percent of the world 's population lived in poverty to get to eighteen percent poverty this year did we hit this target well we exceeded it this year global poverty is going to fall to twelve percent but the pessimists and doomsayers who say that the world can 't get better are simply wrong so how did we achieve this success well a lot of it was because of economic growth which have seen rapid economic growth in recent years so can we pull off the same trick again can economic growth get us to the global goals they 're also pretty complicated over seventeen goals there are then one while some of the goals are pretty specific end hunger others are a lot vaguer i 'm going to use a tool called the social progress index what this does is measures all the stuff the global goals are trying but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark and track progress over time secondly does everyone have the building blocks of a better life education information freedom from discrimination and access to the world 's most advanced knowledge the social progress index sums all this together using fifty two indicators to create an aggregate score on a scale of zero to one hundred the highest performing country central african republic scores thirty one and that global score is sixty one in concrete terms that means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress about the same of cuba or kazakhstan today so having looked at the numbers my estimate is that a score of would not only be a giant so there 's our target seventy five out of one hundred can we get there well the social progress index can help us calculate this and what that lets us do is understand the relationship between economic growth and social progress i 've put social progress the stuff the global goals are trying to achieve higher is better and then and in there i 'm now going to put all the countries of the world each one represented and on top of that i 'm going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship and what this tells us is that as we get richer social progress does tend to improve and now we can use this information to start building our we have a social progress score of sixty one and a gdp per capita of $ fourteen thousand and the place we 're trying to get to remember how rich are we going to be in two thousand and thirty that 's what we need to know next well if they 're right and they came back and if the world world 's average wealth goes from $ fourteen thousand a year to $ twenty three thousand a year social progress is going to increase from sixty one to sixty two point four just sixty two point four just a tiny increase now this seems a bit strange economic growth seems to have really helped so what 's going on we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits there are costs to the environment costs from new health problems like obesity so are the pessimists right let me take you back to that regression line so this is the average relationship between gdp and social progress and this is what our last forecast was based on but as you saw already there is actually lots of noise around this trend line what we have countries that are underperforming on social progress relative to their wealth but hasn 't made much headway on human rights or environmental issues india has a space program and millions of people without toilets now on the other hand we have countries on social progress relative to their gdp costa rica has prioritized education health and environmental sustainability and despite only having a rather modest gdp and costa rica 's not alone because it tells us first of all it tells us that we already in the world have the solutions to many of the problems that the global goals are trying to solve it also tells us that we 're not slaves to gdp how much and the place we want to get to is seventy five so let 's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress the russia china indias just up to the average how much social progress does that get us well that takes us to sixty five so let 's get a little bit more optimistic and say what if every country gets a little bit better at turning its wealth into well being well then we get to sixty seven and now let 's be even bolder what if every country in the world chose to be like costa rica in prioritizing human well being using its wealth for the well being of its citizens well then we get to nearly seventy three even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there if it just raises the i believe the global goals are a historic opportunity because the world 's leaders have promised to deliver them let 's not dismiss the goals or slide into pessimism let 's hold them to that promise and i want to finish by showing you a way to do that called the people 's report card the people 's report card brings together all this data into a simple framework that we 'll all be familiar with from our school days to hold them to account it grades our performance on the global goals on a scale from f to a where f is humanity at its worst and a is humanity at its best our world today is scoring a c and that 's why we 're going to be updating the people 's report card annually for the world and for all the countries of the world so we can hold our leaders to account to achieve this target and fulfill this promise if our leaders do things differently to happen that needs us to demand it so let 's reject business as usual just one question the millennium development goals established fifteen years ago they were kind of applying to every country but it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging the new global goals are explicitly universal they ask for every country to show action and to show progress how can i as a private citizen use the report card to even i 'm sorry to say bruno switzerland has got to work to do and so that 's why we 're going to produce these report cards in two thousand and sixteen for every country in the world then we can really see how are we doing and it 's not going to be and that then i think is to provide a point of focus for people to start demanding"
