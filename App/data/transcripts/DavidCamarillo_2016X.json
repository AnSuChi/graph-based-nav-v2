  "transcript": "and i have to tell you though what was much worse than that was a pair of bike and i 'm still dealing with the effects of the most recent one today as i stand in front of you there is a fear around concussion that does have some evidence behind it there is information that a repeated history of concussion can lead to early dementia such as alzheimer 's and chronic traumatic encephalopathy subject of the will smith movie concussion and so another thing that i should tell you that you may not know is that the helmets that are worn in bicycling and football and many activities not designed or tested for how well they can protect your children against concussion they 're in fact designed and tested for their ability to and so i get this question all the time from parents and they ask me would you let your own should i let my child play soccer and and i want to know how can we prevent concussion is that even possible and most experts think that it 's not the reason we 're able to prevent skull fracture with helmets is because it 's pretty simple we know how it works concussion has been much more of a mystery the cdc website comes up and this video essentially tells the whole story what you see is the head moves forward it rebounds off the skull and then proceeds to run into the other side of the skull which i 'll note was funded by the nfl is that the where it looks like it 's been damaged or injured so it 's on the outer surface of the brain and what i 'd like to do with this video is to tell you so one thing that i do agree with and i think most experts would is that the brain does have these dynamics it does lag behind the skull and then catch up and move back and forth and oscillate that we think is true however the amount of motion you see in the brain in this video is is probably not right at all there 's very little room in the cranial vault only a few the other problem with this video is that the brain is shown as a kind of rigid whole as it moves around and that 's not true either and you can think of it kind and so now the way that we 're approaching this problem to try to understand the mouthguard and when someone is struck in the head it can tell you the principle behind the mouthguard is this it fits onto your teeth your teeth are one of the hardest substances so it rigidly couples to your skull and gives you the most precise possible measurement of how the skull moves and they all simply move around too much and so we found that this is the only reliable way to take a good measurement so now that we 've got this device so where can we find a group of willing volunteers to go out and smash their heads so this is our laboratory and i want to show you the first concussion we measured with this device one of the things that i should point out is the device has this gyroscope in it and that allows you to measure the rotation of the head most experts think that that 's the critical factor that might start to tell us what is happening in concussion so please watch this video but when we extract the data out of the mouthguard that he was wearing we can see much more detail much richer information and one of the things that we noticed here and so that did something first that was a little counterintuitive his head did not move to the right in fact it rotated first to the left so this left right motion was sort of a phenomenon and we think that is probably what led to the brain injury and so this is a simulation using the data from our mouthguard from the injury i just showed you and what you see is the brain this the brain twisting and contorting as i mentioned so you can see this doesn 't look a lot like the cdc video and the main thing i want to draw your attention to is this red spot so the red spot is very close to the center of the brain and relatively speaking you don 't see a lot of of colors like that on the exterior surface as the cdc video showed now to explain a little more detail about how we think concussion might be happening one thing i should mention is that we and others have observed that a concussion is more likely when you 're struck and your head rotates in this direction this is more common well one thing that you 'll notice in the human brain that is different than other animals is we have these two very large lobes we have the right brain and the left brain and in that fissure and so forces can rapidly transmit right down to the center of your brain what 's there at the bottom of this fissure it 's the wiring of your brain and in fact this red bundle here at the bottom of that fissure is the single largest fiber bundle that is the wiring that connects the right and left sides of your brain it 's called the corpus callosum and we think that this might be one of the most common mechanisms of it causes a dissociation between your right and your left brain and could explain some of the symptoms of concussion so this is an image of a football player and the thing that i want to point out is if you look at the corpus callosum and it is and so all of this tissue near the center of the brain has died off over time so what we 're and i hope to give you a sense of hope by the end of this talk it still takes a defined amount of time and what we think is that if we can slow the head down just the brain does not lag behind the skull but instead it moves then we might be able to prevent this mechanism of concussion so how can we slow the head down so with more space you have more time and this is a bit of a joke but some of you may have seen this this is bubble soccer and it 's a real sport in fact i saw some young adults playing this sport down the street from my house the other day and as far as i know there have been no reported concussions but in all seriousness this principle does work but this has gone too far this isn 't something that 's practical for bike riding or and so we are collaborating with a company in sweden called hvding some of you may have seen their work and they 're using the same principle of of air to give you some extra space kids don 't try this at home please this stuntman does not have a helmet and this neck collar has sensors in it the it detects when he 's likely to have a fall and there 's an airbag that explodes and triggers the same way that an airbag works in your car essentially and but in order for us to actually realize the benefits of technology that can prevent concussion it needs to meet regulations and this device is for sale in europe but is not for sale in the us and probably won 't be any time soon so i wanted to tell you why there are some good reasons and then there are some not so good reasons the consumer product safety commission has been given jurisdiction to approve any bike helmet for sale and this is the test they use this is back to what i was telling you at the beginning about skull fracture that 's what this test is for and that 's an important thing to do it can save your life but it 's not sufficient i would say so for example one thing this test doesn 't evaluate is it doesn 't tell you is that airbag going to trigger at the right time and place and not trigger when it doesn 't need to it 's not going to tell you is this helmet likely to prevent concussion or not and if you look at football helmets which aren 't regulated so in my lab we are working on not only the mechanism of concussion and we hope that the government can use this type of information to encourage innovation by letting consumers know how protected are you and i want to bring this back finally to the original question i asked which is and this might be just a result of my own traumatic experience i 'm much more nervous about my daughter rose riding a bicycle and so my personal goal is to and i believe this is possible is to further develop these technologies and in and i am confident that we will be able to before she 's ready to ride a two wheeler and so what i 'd like to do and i know that this is for some of you of more immediate nature i 've got a couple years here is to be able to tell parents and grandparents when i 'm asked and i 'm very fortunate to have a wonderful team at stanford that 's working hard on this but for now i will tell you please don 't just be afraid when you hear the word concussion there is hope"
