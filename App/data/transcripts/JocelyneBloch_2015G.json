  "transcript": "every day with human tragedies i realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after and what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that the brain has very little ability for self repair and after a major injury of your central nervous system the patients often remain with a severe handicap and that 's probably the reason why i 've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon it 's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies you 've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function it 's really an amazing technology however i think that we are approaching this dream and i would like to show you and that with a little bit of help the brain is able so the story started fifteen years ago at that time i was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room you have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma his brain is swelling and he 's increasing his intracranial and in order to save his life you have to decrease this intracranial pressure and to do that you sometimes have so instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain we decided with who is a colleague of mine a biologist to study them what do i mean by that we wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue and after many attempts and that was for us a major surprise why because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture with large green cells surrounding small and you may remember from biology class the adult brain has stem cells but they 're very rare and they 're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain so it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater and there was another intriguing observation regular stem cells are very active cells cells that divide divide divide very quickly and they never die they 're immortal cells but these cells behave so we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells and it took us a long time to understand where they came from they come from these blue and red cells are called they helped your brain to fold itself we think that they may participate brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions but it 's not so sure we decided to design and then to culture the cells exactly the autologous grafts autografts so the first question we had what will happen if we re implant these cells in a normal brain and what will happen if we re implant the same cells in a lesioned brain thanks to the help of professor eric rouiller we worked with monkeys so in the the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks as if they go back home the space is already busy they are not needed there so they disappear we performed the lesion we re implanted exactly the same the cells remained those are the cells that were re implanted could not stop here of course so for that we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task they had to retrieve food pellets from a tray they were very good at it and when they had reached a plateau of performance so the monkeys were move their hand anymore and exactly the same as humans would do they recover to a certain extent exactly the same for so on the left side you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered he 's at about forty to fifty percent of his previous performance before the lesion he 's not so accurate i tell you since that we know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models like parkinson 's disease for example but our dream is still to implant them in humans and i really hope that i 'll be able to show you soon that the human sure that right now there are several dozen people in the audience possibly even a majority who are thinking i know somebody who can use this i do in any case and of course the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials jocelyne bloch the biggest obstacles are regulations so from these exciting results you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials bg which is understandable the brain is delicate etc jb but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it you know bg if you project yourself having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials if you project yourself yourself out in time how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available jb so it 's very difficult to say it depends first on the approval of so it takes already a long time to select the patients do the the treatment and evaluate if it 's useful to do this kind of treatment and then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial you have to really prove first first that it 's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody bg and safe of course jb of course bg jocelyne thank you for coming to ted and sharing this"
