science then we can engineer the future so if or health policy or education seat of the pants wisdom now before i get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising because i 'm not engaged in the business of magic there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict and there are some that it can 't it can predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion that is in essence everything that has to do with politics much of what has to do with business it 's not going up any time really soon math has come into the picture we can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics we now what is game theory about it assumes that people are looking out for what 's good for them that doesn 't seem terribly shocking although it 's controversial for a lot of people that we are self interested in order to look out for what 's best for them or what they think is best for them people have values they identify what they want and they face now who is rational a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about you know i think there are only two exceptions that i 'm aware they switch what they think all the time now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests we have to think about who has influence in the world if you 're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior with regard to producing pollutants and many of you may have noticed that doesn 't have as big an effect as perhaps you would like it to have but if you show them that it 's in their interest then they 're responsive the president of the united states we would like to think may have some influence certainly the president in iran has some influence but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person or about energy that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers if we 're talking maybe it 's the secretary of defense the director of national intelligence maybe the ambassador to the united nations or somebody else each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them so they can advise the president there are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome not just the people at the pinnacle unfortunately a lot of times we don 't do that there 's a good reason that we don 't do that and there 's a good reason that using game theory and computers we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people imagine a problem with just five wants to know what harry and jane and george and frank and what they 're saying to harry and harry wants that 's a complicated problem that 's a lot to know there are a lot of linkages now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep one hundred and twenty things straight suppose we double the number of influencers from five to ten does but computers they can and you 're going to be wondering why should we believe what he 's saying going to show you a factoid this is an assessment by the central intelligence agency of the percentage of time that the model i 'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong a cia claim you can read it it was declassified a while ago you can read it in a volume edited by h bradford westerfield yale university press so what do we need to know in order to predict you may be surprised to find out we don 't need to know very much we need to know what they say and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision making we need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand that is how willing are they to drop what they 're doing when the issue comes up and attend to it instead of something that 's on their plate how big a deal is it to them and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue if we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision they care about the outcome they 'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible they 're careerists they also care about getting credit and faithfully holding to it going down so with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have what the chances are that they 're willing to take what they 're after what they how they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information but once we know where they are we 're worried about where they 're going to be headed in the future how they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting i remind you of that ninety so where are we going to get this information we can get this information the financial times the new york times u s news and world report lots of sources like that or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems because those experts know this information if they don 't lets turn to iran let me make three important predictions you can check this out time will tell what is iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program ahmadinejad how are things going for him how are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two you take a look at this this is not based on i want to be very clear here i 'm not projecting some past i 've taken inputs on positions and so forth run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction the bomb and then the model makes predictions down the road at one hundred and fifteen they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel to show that they know how but they wouldn the yellow line shows us the most likely path the yellow line includes an analysis of eighty seven decision makers in iran and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure iran various players in the united states and egypt and saudi arabia and russia european union japan so on and so forth but you can see that the line comes down faster we get to a stable equilibrium outcome and that equilibrium is not what the united states would like but it 's probably an equilibrium that the united states can live with and that a lot of others can live and that is that iran will achieve that nationalist pride how is this happening over here you can see this is the distribution of power this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of two thousand and ten early parts of two thousand and eleven out here today that power disappears completely nobody supports that by two thousand and eleven so the outcome is going to be the weapons grade fuel take a look at these guys they 're growing in power the oil people the bazaaries they are growing in political clout as the mullahs are isolating themselves with the exception of one group of mullahs who are not well known to americans that 's this line here growing in power these are the ayatollahs mostly based in qom who have great clout in the religious community have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder because they see iran going in an unhealthy direction a direction contrary to what khomeini had in mind here is mr ahmadinejad he is on the way down again whether we 're talking that this sort of technology can be applied to and the reason that being able to predict those things is important but because if you can predict what people will do you can engineer what they will do and if you engineer what i would like to leave you with one thought which is for me the dominant theme when people say to you that 's impossible you say i love that you put it out there i got very nervous halfway through the talk though just panicking whether you 'd included in your model the possibility that putting this prediction out there might and they 've also pondered that it would be a good thing if and engaged in the same sorts of because it would change things but it would change things in two beneficial ways it would hasten and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time and it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with without having to manipulate them so much which is lets go there and we could get there a lot sooner and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end and the world would be a better place ca"
