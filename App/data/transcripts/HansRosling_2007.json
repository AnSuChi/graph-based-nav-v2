  "transcript": "because of that we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries which is wrong and that animated graphics can make a difference things are changing and today by first of may full access to the databases and if i could share the image with you on the screen and let me repeat what you saw last year the bubbles are the countries here you have the fertility rate the number of children per woman and there you have the length of life in years this is one thousand nine hundred and fifty those were the industrialized countries those were developing countries at that time there was a and it it went on quite well and this is what happens and they go over all this i 'm going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how how things really changed and it 's africa that stands out as the problem down here doesn 't it large families still because this is where we are will it be possible that this will happen and this is where we are today now could we and i would like to show that against child survival we 'll swap the axis here you have child mortality i 've added some historical statistics here we go here we go here we go some countries still had statistics we are looking down in the archive and when we are down there is only austria and sweden that can produce numbers they had one thousand dollars per person per year and they lost one fifth of their kids before their first birthday if we play the entire world how they got slowly richer and richer and they add statistics it was only by the turn and this is the united states moving away here and we will soon see china coming up in the very far end corner here and it moves up with mao tse tung getting health not getting so rich there he died and this is what the world looks like today let us have a look at the united states we have a function here i can tell the world and we can see and down in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen the united states was a neighbor of india present contemporary india and that means proportionally but we have to bring united states forward quite a while to find the same health of the united states as we have in the philippines about arabic countries latin america are much more ahead in being healthy educated having human resources than they are economically there 's a discrepancy in what 's happening today in the emerging economies benefits social progress are going ahead of economical progress and i think we have to go there we have two thousand and one or two thousand and two the united states has the same health as chile chile 's catching up within some years chile may have better child survival than the united states this is really a change that you have this lag of more or less thirty forty years ' difference on the health and behind the health is the educational level and there 's a lot of infrastructure things and and we go back to and i 'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish ford here and the brownish volvo and here we go here we go the toyota has a very bad start down here you can see the toyota got off track and now the toyota is coming on the healthier side of sweden can you see that and they are taking over sweden and they are now healthier than sweden that 's the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota we have to look over generations to understand it and and this is the same thing money and this is when my grandma was born one thousand eight hundred and ninety one she took care of me as a child so i 'm not talking about statistic now now it 's oral history in my family that 's when i believe statistics i think it 's the best way of verifying historical statistics sweden was like ghana it 's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub saharan africa and my daughter she was born in chile and the was born in singapore now the healthiest country on this earth it bypassed sweden about two to three years ago with better child survival but they 're very small you know they 're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests but now this looks also like a very good story but it 's not really that easy that it 's all a good story because i have to show you one of the other facilities we can also make the color here represent the variable and what am i choosing here this is and united states was emitting sixteen tons per person and china was emitting zero point six and india was emitting zero point and what happens when we moved on well you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide and there we are two thousand and one and in the discussion i attended the minister of the environment of india said well you were the one who caused the problem the oecd countries the high income countries they were the ones who caused the climate change we forgive you because you didn 't know it but from now on we count per capita and everyone is responsible for the per capita emission this really shows you we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without i 've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world but i don 't think it 's like this the world is quite a messy place place this we can call dollar street everyone lives on this street here what they earn and we drive away here we find the first garden in and how do they live if we look at the bed here we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor this is what poverty and the interesting thing when you go around here in the photo panorama you see the family still sitting on the floor there when you really can get good working conditions in in the family and if you really want to see the difference you look and it can become much better we can get out of poverty and this is the result of the farmers needs research the nice thing here is that you can 't see who are the researchers in this picture that 's when research functions in poor societies when you 're in poverty it 's about having food and these two young farmers they are girls now because the parents are dead from hiv and aids they discuss with a trained agronomist this is one of the best agronomists in malawi junatambe kumbira that 's one context getting out of poverty the women told us one thing get us technology we hate this then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves but there 's a need for a market to get away from poverty and this woman is very happy now bringing her products to the market but she 's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count and won 't be cheated when she reaches the market and she wants the infrastructure it is nice with a paved road you can do this i find my my experience from twenty years of africa is that africa has not done bad in fifty years they 've because we don 't consider where they came from it 's this stupid concept temperature and everything i only know two types of wine red and white but my neighbor only knows two types of countries industrialized and developing and i know two hundred i know about the small data homage to the office package no what is this what is this what am i telling i 'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development everyone wants your pet thing if you are in the corporate sector you love micro credit if you are fighting in a non governmental organization you love equity between gender or if you are a teacher you 'll love unesco and so on we have to have more than our own thing we need everything all these things are important for development especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare now what and what are the means for development let me first grade what are the most important means economic growth to me as a public health professor is the most important thing for governance to have a government which functions that 's what brought california out of the misery of one thousand eight hundred and fifty education human resources are important health is also important but not that much as environment is important human rights is also important but it just gets one cross now what about goals governance well it 's health i give two points i mean it but where are the important goals of course it 's human rights and culture culture is the most important thing i would say because that 's what brings joy to and i 'm going to"
