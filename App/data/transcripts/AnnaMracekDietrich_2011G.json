  "transcript": "we 've wanted to do this for about a hundred years and there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success 't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really truly seamlessly integrates the two dimensional world that we 're comfortable in with the three dimensional sky above us that i don 't know about you but i really enjoy spending time in we looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren 't available previously we have modern composite materials we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy and have better power to rate ratios than have ever been available we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly directly to you in the cockpit but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective we realized that we were going to be getting the same result that people had been getting for the last hundred and the result is the terrafugia transition it 's a and it works after two years of an innovative design and construction process the proof of concept made its public debut in two thousand and eight now like with anything that 's really different from the status quo it didn 't always go so well testing that aircraft and we discovered that it 's a very good thing that when you go home with something that 's been broken you 've actually learned a lot more than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives the first time through build in the air the picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time and we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over the flight testing that followed that was as basic and low risk as we could make it but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market the general aviation community and with the regulators that govern the use of design of aircraft particularly in the states about a year ago gave us an exemption for the transition to allow us to have an additional one hundred and ten lbs within the light sport aircraft category now that doesn 't sound like a lot but it 's very important because being able to deliver the transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it a sport pilot can be certificated in as little as twenty hours of flight time and at one hundred and ten lbs that 's very important for solving the other side of the equation driving it turns out that driving with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles is actually a harder problem to solve than flying for those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground this may be counter intuitive cobblestones pedestrians other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with fortunately necessity remains the mother of invention and a lot of the design work that we 're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground everything from a transmission and liquid based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop and go traffic to a custom designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you 're flying or the wheels on the ground to the automated wing folding mechanism that we 'll see in a moment we have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than ten percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car the regulations for vehicles on the road weren 't written with an airplane in mind so we did need a little bit of support from the national highway you may have seen in the news recently they came through with us at the end of last month with a few special exemptions that will allow the transition to be sold in the same category as as suvs and light trucks as a multi purpose passenger vehicle it is now officially designed for occasional off road use now let 's see it in action you and that 's the automated wing folding mechanism that 's real time you just push a few buttons in the cockpit and the wings come out once they 're fully deployed there 's a mechanical lock that goes into place again from inside the cockpit they 're now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight just like putting down your convertible top and you 're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that which was that it was remarkably unremarkable he would go onto tell us that the transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he 'd flown in his entire 30 year career as a test pilot so despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary we really focused on doing as little new as possible we 've had to overcome challenges like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that i talked about figuring out how to politely respond when a regulator tells you but that won 't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended still if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and construction of the the two production prototypes that we 're working but i do think that the transition should be your next airplane here 's why while nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports there is a huge underutilized resource out there there are thousands of local airstrips that don 't see the transition gives you a safer more convenient and more fun way of using this resource for those of you who aren 't yet pilots there 's four main reasons why those of us who are don 't fly as much as we 'd like to door to door travel time and mobility at your destination doesn 't matter if it rains a little you have a windshield wiper and the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas travel time is reduced because now instead of lugging bags finding a parking space taking off your shoes you 're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go and mobility to your destination is clearly solved just fold up the wings and keep going the transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller more accessible place it also continues to be a fabulous adventure thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you"
