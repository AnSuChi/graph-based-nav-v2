  "transcript": "i never think about the future it comes soon enough i 'm here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now over the past two hundred years the world has experienced two major waves of innovation then the internet revolution brought us computing power data networks and our lives have never been the same now we are experiencing another it 's the marriage of minds and machines and our lives will never be the same in my current role i see up close how technology is beginning to transform industrial sectors that play a huge role in our transportation health care for an economist this is highly unusual and it 's extremely exciting because this is a transformation as powerful as the industrial revolution and more and before the industrial revolution there was no economic growth to speak of so what is this industrial internet industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see hear feel a lot more than ever before generating prodigious amounts of data and not just individual machines hospitals it is asset optimization and system optimization a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and thanks to advances in cloud computing a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data they are gas turbines medical devices communicating seamlessly with each other and with us it 's a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it we are beginning to deploy throughout the industrial system embedded virtualization multi core processor technology and allowing us to remotely and automatically monitor manage and upgrade industrial assets why does any of this matter at all well first of all it 's already allowing us to shift towards preventive without wasting time servicing them on a fixed schedule and this in turn is pushing us towards zero unplanned downtime which means there will be no more power outages no more flight delays so let me give you a few examples of how these brilliant machines work and some of the examples may seem trivial let 's start with aviation today ten percent of all flights cancellations and delays are due to unscheduled maintenance events something goes wrong unexpectedly this results in eight billion dollars in costs missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal so how can the industrial internet help here we 've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss or take healthcare today nurses spend but it 's less time spent caring for patients staff and medical equipment has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour if you need surgery one hour matters developing better analytics imagine a neurologist a cardiologist an orthopedic surgeon they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster so all of this translates into better health outcomes but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over sixty billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide and that is just including renewable energy wind farms equipped with and diagnostics that allow wind turbines to talk to each other and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way depending on how the wind is blowing because industrial data are now growing they will account for over fifty percent of all digital information but this is not just about data so let me switch gears and tell you how this is impacting already the the jobs we do every day because this new wave of innovation transmit data that they can run through let 's stop and think about this for a minute because this is a very important point this new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work and unemployment is already high and there is always automation of industry and employment has gone up because innovation is fundamentally about growth it makes products more affordable it creates new demand new jobs but think about it just as a child so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels the worker of the future will be more like iron man than the charlie chaplin of times managers who understand their industry but now let 's take a step back let 's look at the big are people who argue that today 's innovation is all about social media and silly games with nowhere near the transformational power of the industrial revolution they say that all the growth enhancing innovations are behind us and every time i hear this i can 't help thinking that even back in the stone age and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill cool toy sure but compared to fire it will have no impact the big discoveries are all behind us this technological revolution is as inspiring and transformational as anything we have ever seen human they 've made our lives healthier and more rewarding and the new wave of innovation which is beginning to sweep through industry is no different in the u s alone the industrial internet could raise average income by twenty five to forty percent boosting growth to rates we haven 't seen in a long time and adding between ten and fifteen trillion dollars to global gdp that is the size but this is not a foregone conclusion obstacles to overcome we will need to invest in the new technologies we will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices we will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks and the education system will need to evolve to ensure students are equipped with the right skills it and i see the difference this makes in a hospital"
