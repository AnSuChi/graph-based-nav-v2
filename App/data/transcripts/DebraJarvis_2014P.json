  "transcript": "i just met you on a bus so you 're going to tell me three things about yourself that just define you as a person three things about yourself that will help me understand who you are three things that just get to your very essence and what i 'm wondering is of those three things is any one of them surviving some kind of trauma cancer survivor ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves by our wounds and where i have seen this survivor identity have the most consequences is in the cancer community and i 've been around this community for a long time because i 've been a hospice and a hospital chaplain for almost thirty years and in two thousand and five i was working at a big cancer center when i received the news that my mother had breast cancer and then five days later i received the news that i had breast cancer my mother and i can be competitive laughter but and in fact i thought well if you have to have cancer it 's pretty convenient to be working at a place that treats it but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people what you 're the chaplain you should be so i did get my treatment at the cancer center where i worked which was amazingly convenient and i had chemotherapy and a mastectomy and a saline implant put in and so before i say another word let me just say right now this is the fake one because i 'll see somebody go medicine most of it is about feelings and faith and losing and finding your identity and discovering strength and flexibility you never even knew you had it 's about realizing that the most important things in life are not things and it 's about laughing in the face of uncertainty and learning that the way to get out of almost anything is to say i have cancer so the other thing i learned was that i don 't have to take on cancer survivor as my identity but boy are there powerful forces pushing me to do just that now don 't please misunderstand me cancer organizations and the drive for early screening and cancer awareness and cancer research have normalized cancer we can talk about cancer and we can support so about a week after my surgery we had a houseguest that was probably our first mistake and keep in mind that at this point in my life i had been a chaplain for over twenty years and issues like dying and death so at dinner that night our houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head and say you know deb now you 're really going to learn what 's important yes you are going to make some big changes in your you 're going to start thinking about your death yep this cancer is your wakeup call it 's instant crap the only reason i did not kill him with my bare hands was because i could but i did say followed by a regular word that made my husband say she 's on narcotics and then after my treatment it just felt like everyone t shirt and the headband and the earrings and the bracelet and the panties panties no seriously google it how is that raising awareness only my husband he 's pretty aware of cancer already it was at that point where i felt like oh my god this is just taking over my life we all know that the way to we have to decide what it means and it we don 't all have to start a foundation or an organization or write a book or make a documentary can be maybe we make one small decision about our lives that can bring about big change and so it was something of a shock to us to he would come in for chemotherapy by himself and i even asked him i said hey how come you never bring a friend with you really have any friends so and then i asked him i said so what are you going to do now and he answered did he started volunteering and he made friends there and at christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment and the place was filled don 't let it claim you he decided that the meaning of his experience so what about you how are you going to find meaning it could be a recent one or it could be one that you 've been carrying around for a really long time hear how static don 't let it claim you because if you do i believe you will become trapped but of course sometimes it 's not outside pressures that cause us to take on that identity of survivor but then we get stuck now one of the first things i learned as a chaplain intern was the three c 's of the chaplain 's job comfort or challenge now we all pretty much love the comforting and the clarifying the confronting not so much one of the other things that i loved about being a chaplain was seeing patients a year or even several years after their treatment because it was just really cool to see so i was thrilled one day to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic from a patient who i had seen the year before so i got down to the lobby and they were ecstatic because she had just gotten all of her test results back and she was which i used to think meant not entirely dead we sat down to visit and it was so weird because within two minutes she started retelling me the story of her diagnosis agony and she ended her story with going to go get coffee and they left people were leaving the bus before she even got to number two or number three and i gave her a hug i said get down off your cross and she said what and i repeated get down off your cross and to her she could talk about her reasons for embracing and then clinging to this identity but now it was having the opposite effect it was pushing people away but she didn 't want to let that crucified self die perhaps you are thinking i was a little harsh with her so i must tell you that many many years before i had been fired from a job that i loved and i would not stop talking about my innocence and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt until finally just like this woman people were walking away from me until i finally realized i didn 't want to let that crucified self die we all know that with any resurrection story you have to die first the christian story jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb and i believe that for us being in the tomb means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds and allowing ourselves to be healed we have to let that crucified self die we have to let that old story go so that a new story a truer story can be told don 't let it claim you what if there were no survivors meaning what if people decided to just claim their trauma as an experience maybe it would be the end of being trapped in our wounds and the beginning of maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves by who we have become and who we are becoming so perhaps survivor was not one of the three things that you would tell me no matter and this is my stop"
