  "transcript": "they were husband and wife despite the new york times ' and vanity fair 's best efforts recently they 're not brothers and they were a lot of fun you know ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family so he would be one hundred this june we have a lot of cool celebrations that we 're going to do the thing about their work is that most people come to the door of furniture i suspect you probably recognize this chair and some of the others i 'm going to show you but we 're going to first enter through the door of the big top is that you know why am i showing it is it because charles and ray made this film this is actually a training film for a clown college that they had they also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture the film that we 're about to see is a film they made for the moscow world 's fair video it has many contrasts it is rough and it is flat in places but people live on this land and as in russia they are drawn together into towns and cities here is something of the way they live eames demetrios now this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the united states it was on seven screens and it was two hundred feet across and it was at the height of the cold war the nixon khrushchev kitchen debate happened about fifty feet from where this was commonality the first line and you can imagine and the thing about it is that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images because the important thing was to get the gestalt of what the what the images were about so but the thing about charles and ray is that they they were always modeling stuff they were always trying things out i think one of the things i am passionate about my grandparents work i 'm passionate about my work but on top of all that i 'm passionate about and you know but it 's not about them becoming and this is a model that they did of that seven screen presentation and charles just this is an unusual installation of airport seating so what we 're going to see is some of the icons of eames furniture and the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially of a good host anticipating the needs of the guest it 's just the things you try out to kind of make it make it work better and you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs some of them are kind of cool looking it 's like hey why didn 't they try that it was that hands on iterative process which is so much like vernacular and folk design in traditional cultures and i think that 's one of the commonalities between modernism and traditional design i think it may be a real common ground as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next twenty or thirty years the other thing that 's is that you look at this and it 's a pivot between a process and a system film i made about the making of the eames lounge chair the design process for charles and ray never never ended in manufacturing it continued they were always trying to make thing better and better because it 's like as bill clinton was saying about rwandan health clinics you 've got to create a system that will work it worked better h base much more practical and i was very touched by dean kamen 's work for the for the military or for the soldiers because charles and ray designed a molded plywood splint this is it and they 'd been working which was incredibly important to them this is a house that charles and ray designed my sister is chasing someone else although i endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary and then this is a film on the lower left that charles and ray made now look at that plastic chair make the house curvy they didn 't say our style is grids let 's make the chair griddy they focused on the need they tried to solve the design design problem charles used to say the extent to which very expensive medium here 's a film we 've been hearing things about the powers of ten is a film they made if we watch the next clip you 're the eames ' film tops lower left and a lamp that charles designed for a church video which in turn to a local group of galaxies these form part of a grouping system much as the stars do they are so many and so varied that from this distance they appear like the stars from earth ed you 've seen that film and what 's so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale everybody here is coming at it from a different way i want to give you one example e o wilson once told me that when he looked at ants he loved of course and he wanted to learn more about them he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale so here is the tiny creature and yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much including what ended up being the ted it was part of the quality of life and here is some some family pictures and you can see why i 'm down on style with a haircut like that but anyway i remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the eames house when i was a kid so we 're going to watch another film this is a film the one called toys you can see me i have the same haircut upper left is a materials in the plywood so can you read it lucia angel you 've been to the website dogs of saint louis in the late in the i saw many trains and also rode on one i hope you had a nice time at buddy guys did pretty good cool so my mom and charles had this great relationship where they 'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another and it 's all part of the you know they used to say take your pleasure seriously these are some images from a project of mine that 's called kymaerica it 's sort of an alternative universe it 's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape those plaques are plaques we 've been installing around north america we 're about to do six in the u k next week and they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world so of course since it 's bronze it has to be true video kymaerica with waterfalls tumbling through our ed this is one of the traditional kymaerican songs and so we had spelling bees in paris illinois video your word is n carolina girl y i n d i a n a in the kymaerican story three dimensional fictional but what is really cool is that we take our visual environment as inevitable and it 's not other things could have happened the japanese could have discovered monterey and we could have been born one hundred thousand years ago and fun things this is the museum of the bench they have trading cards and all sorts of cool things and you 're kind of trapped in the texture the tahatchabe the great road building culture so let 's watch that nobody 's ever seen it cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here it silent we don 't have a track for it yet very simple it 's just a start but and you try something out but here is what 's really great see that chair there the orange one that 's the organic chair one thousand nine hundred and forty so my point is that this scope of vision this holistic vision of design was with them from the beginning it wasn 't like oh we made some chairs and got successful now we 're going to do some movies it was always part of how they looked at the world and that 's what 's really powerful and i think that all of us in this room as you move design forward it 's not about just doing one thing it 's about how you approach problems and there is this huge beautiful commonality between design business and i 've shown you some of the images i just want to focus on sound now so this is charles ' voice charles eames in india those without and the lowest in caste eat very often particularly in southern india they eat off of a banana leaf and those a little bit up the scale eat off of a sort of a low fired ceramic dish and a little bit higher why they and then things and there is solid silver thalis and but you can go beyond that and but a certain amount of go to the next step and they eat off a banana leaf and i think that in these times when we fall back and regroup that somehow or other the banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there because i 'm not prepared to say that the banana leaf that one eats off of is the same but it that process that has happened within the man that changes the the banana leaf"
