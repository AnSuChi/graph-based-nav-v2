  "transcript": "the person that we would all acknowledge as i 'm going to ignore their cautions and make one very specific forecast in the world that we are creating very quickly which means we 're going to need fewer truck drivers we 're going to hook siri up to watson and use that to automate a lot of the work that 's currently done by customer and we 're already taking which means we need a lot fewer people to be walking up and down those aisles now for about two hundred years people have been saying exactly what i 'm telling you the age of technological unemployment is at hand why is this time different if it really is the reason it 's different is that just in the past few years our machines have started mobile humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive but the research arm of the defense department just launched a competition to have them do things like this and if the track record is any guide this competition is going to be successful so when i look around i think the day is not too far off at all when we 're going to have and we 're creating a world where there is going to be more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs it 's a world that erik brynjolfsson and i are calling the new machine age the thing to keep in mind is that this is absolutely great news this is the best economic news on the planet these days the first is technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we 're on while at the same time prices go down and volume and quality just and we get freed up from drudgery when i talk about this with my friends in cambridge and silicon valley they say fantastic no more drudgery no more toil this gives us the chance to imagine an entirely different kind of society a society where the creators and the discoverers and the performers and the innovators and there 's actually a huge amount of truth here we are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place in a world where it is just about as easy to generate an object as it is to print a document we have amazing new possibilities the people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists are now makers and they 're responsible for massive amounts of so this is a time of great flourishing and the more i look around the more convinced i become that this quote from the physicist freeman dyson is not hyperbole at all this is just a plain statement of the facts we are in the middle of an astonishing period we 're going to face two really thorny sets of challenges as we head deeper into the future that we 're creating the first are economic back and forth between henry ford ii and walter reuther who was the head of the auto workers they were touring one of the new modern factories and ford playfully turns to reuther and says hey walter how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues and reuther shoots back hey henry how are you going to get them to buy cars and we see this very clearly in the statistics if you look over the past couple decades at the returns if we look at the returns to labor in other words total wages volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people and we 're in danger and they 're captured by images like this this is not the kind of societal that i am concerned about there is no shortage of dystopian visions about what happens when our machines become and they decide to rise up and coordinate attacks against us i 'm going to start worrying about those the day my computer becomes aware of my printer so this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about to tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age i want to tell a story about two let 's make them both white guys and the first one is a engineer doctor lawyer that kind of worker we 're going to call him ted he 's at the top of the american middle class works as a clerk does low level white collar or blue collar work in the economy we 're going to call that guy bill but as the social researcher charles murray has documented as we started to automate the economy the fortunes of bill and ted diverged a lot over this time frame ted has continued to hold a full time job bill hasn 't and ted very rarely has over time ted 's marriage has stayed quite happy bill 's hasn 't while bill 's absolutely have not over time and he 's started to go to prison a lot more often they 're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic and they 've got all the benefits to show from that while bill is leading a very different life they 're actually both proof of how right voltaire was when he talked about the benefits of work and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils [ work saves a man from three great evils boredom vice and need voltaire ] so with these challenges what do we do about them the economic playbook is surprisingly and we are then we have to consider some more radical interventions for example something like a guaranteed minimum income because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth i did a little bit of research on this notion and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those and if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent you might be interested to know that social mobility one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the united the societal one i don 't know what the playbook is for getting bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life i do know that education is a huge part i was a montessori kid for the first few years of my education and what that education taught me is that the world is an interesting place and it felt like i had been sent to the gulag but at the time it felt like the job was to kind of bore me into some submission with what was going on around me we have to do better than this we cannot keep turning out bills so we see some green shoots that things are getting better we see technology deeply impacting education and engaging people from our youngest learners up to our oldest ones and we see very serious and to understand how to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have so the green shoots are out there i don 't want to pretend for a minute that what we have is going to be enough we 're facing very tough challenges to give just one example there are about five million americans who have been unemployed for at least six months we 're not going to fix things for them by sending them back to montessori and my biggest worry is that we 're creating a world where we 're going to have glittering technologies embedded in kind of a but i actually don 't think that 's what we 're going to do i think we 're going to do something a lot better if we wanted to accelerate that process we could do things like have our best economists and policymakers and if we do enough of these kinds of things the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different and then we 're off to the races because i don 't believe for a second that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too let me end it with words from politicians who were similarly distant winston churchill came to my home of mit in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine and he said if we are to bring the broad masses of the people in every land to the table of abundance it can only be by the tireless improvement of all of our means of technical production i am a firm believer in the people if given the truth they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis the great point is to give them the plain facts so the optimistic note great point that i want to leave"
