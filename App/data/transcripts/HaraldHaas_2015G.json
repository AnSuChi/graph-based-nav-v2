  "transcript": "i would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard and the point is this and also to allow for what we call the internet of things tens of billions of devices connected to the internet such an extension of the internet work if it 's almost and this is where the solar cell and the led come in i demonstrated for the first time at ted in two thousand and eleven data incredibly fast and also in a safe and secure manner data is transported by the light encoded in subtle changes of the brightness if we look around we have many leds around us so there 's a rich infrastructure of li fi transmitters around but so far we have been using special devices small photo detectors to receive the information encoded in the data and this is why i have been looking into solar cells and solar panels a solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy this is why we can use a solar cell but now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the led this means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information from the light because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted and the answer to that is yes we can we have shown in the lab that we can receive up to fifty megabytes per second from a standard off the shelf solar cell and this is faster than most broadband connections these days now let me show you in practice in this box is a standard and also we have an instrument here and this instrument shows something at the moment this is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light now what i would like to do first is and what you 'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right if i turn it off we see it drops i turn it on so we harvest energy but next i would like to activate the streaming of the video and i 've done this by pressing this button so now this led lamp here is streaming a video but in order to prove the point i can block the light of the solar cell so first you notice and i can repeat so that is to show but now imagine that this led lamp is a street light and there 's fog and that 's why i brought a handkerchief with me and let me put the handkerchief over first you notice the energy harvested but now the video still continues so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information in this case a high definition video what 's really important here is that a solar cell has while it maintains its primary function as an energy harvesting device that 's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut or indeed lamp post doesn 't matter where the beam hits the solar cell or worse replace the batteries every few months and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the internet thank you"
