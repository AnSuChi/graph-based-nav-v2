  "transcript": "so this is a picture of my dad and me at the beach in far rockaway or actually rockaway park i 'm the one with the blond hair my dad 's the guy with the cigarette it was the sixty 's a lot of people smoked back then in the summer of two thousand and nine dad was diagnosed with lung cancer cancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody if you 're a man in the us you 've got about a one in two chance everybody knows somebody who 's been diagnosed with cancer my dad 's doing better today and part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial of an experimental new drug that happened to be specially formulated and very good for his particular kind of cancer there are over two hundred kinds of cancer and what i want to talk about today is how we can help more people like my dad change the way we think about raising money to fund cancer research so a while after my dad was diagnosed i was having coffee with my friend andrew lo he and we were talking about cancer and andrew had been doing his own bits of research and one of the things that he had been told and that he 'd learned from studying the the literature it 's very difficult so andrew asked me if i 'd want to maybe work with him a bit work on some of the math and the analytics and see if we could figure out something we could do now i 'm not a scientist you know i don 't know how to build a drug fagnan none of those guys are scientists either we don 't know the first thing about how to but we know a little bit about risk mitigation and a little bit about financial engineering and so we started thinking what could we do i 'm going to tell you about some work we 've been doing over the last couple years that we think could fundamentally change the way research for cancer and lots of other things gets done we want to let the imagine that you 're in your lab and you 've developed a new new compound that you think might be therapeutic for for somebody with cancer well you test in animals you test in test you 've got to get the drug tested and the way the drug gets tested is through a series of basically experiments through these large they 're called trials that they do to determine whether the drug is safe and whether it works and all these things so the fda has a very specific protocol in the first phase of this testing which is called testing for in the first phase you give the drug to healthy people and you see if it actually makes them sick in other words are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does it 's not going to be worth it does it cause heart attacks kill people liver failure and it turns out that 's a pretty high hurdle and makes them better and that 's also a higher hurdle people drop out and in the third phase you test it on a very large sample and you 're trying to determine what the right dose is is it better than what 's available today if not then why build it when you 're done with all that what you have is a very small percentage of drugs that start the process actually come out the other side so those blue bottles those blue bottles save lives so now here 's a question if i were to ask you for example to make a one time investment of say two hundred million dollars so two hundred million dollars up front one time to buy one of those bottles i won 't tell you which one it is and in ten years i 'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones does that sound like a good so andrew said to me he said what if we stop thinking about these as drugs what if we start thinking about them as financial assets they 've got really weird payoff structures and all that but 's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them let 's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets we 've been told that there 's a backlog about twenty years of drugs that are waiting to be tested but can 't be funded so we did this math so we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one but we have to figure out how to get people in the capital markets who traditionally don 't invest in this to want to invest in this stuff imagine the megafund starts empty and what it does is it issues some debt and some equity and that generates cash flow that cash flow is used then to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need you can sell some and when you sell them you have money to pay the interest on those bonds but also to fund the next round of trials it 's almost self funding you do that for the course of the transaction you liquidate the portfolio pay back the bonds and you can we spent the next two years doing research we talked to people who have developed drugs we talked to pharmaceutical companies we actually looked at the data for drugs and we also ran millions of simulations and all that actually took a lot of time it was feasible to structure that fund such that when you were done structuring it you could actually produce low risk bonds and you could produce equity but it turns out there are lots of other folks that would be interested that 's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds so we published some articles in the academic press in but it wasn 't until we actually got the popular press interested in this that we we wanted to do more than just make people aware of it we wanted people to get involved computer code and made that available online under an open source license to anybody that wanted it and you guys can download it today if you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work and that was really effective because people that didn 't believe our assumptions could try their own and see how it would work now there but is there enough money there 's one hundred trillion dollars that 's a hundred thousand billion there 's plenty of money but we realized it 's more than just money that 's required we had to get people motivated involved and get them to understand this and we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong what are all the challenges that might get in the way and and we said could you start a work stream on credit risk could you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects could you start a work stream on how you would manage so many projects and we had all these experts get together and do these and then we held a conference the conference was held over this past summer it was was sponsored by the american cancer society and done in collaboration with the national cancer institute we had experts from every field we thought would be important including the government and people that run research centers and for two days they heard the reports from those five work streams and talked about it it was the first time the people who could make this happen sat across the table from each other and had these conversations now i happened to look out the window and hand on my heart since the got people working between paris and san francisco lots of different folks working on this to try to see if we can really make it happen we 're not looking to start a fund but we want somebody else to do this but all of us together with our four hundred and one s with our five hundred and twenty nine plans with our pension plans all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials and get paid well for doing it and save millions of lives like my dad thank you"
