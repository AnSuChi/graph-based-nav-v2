  "transcript": "your company launches a search for an open position the applications start rolling in and the qualified candidates are identified now the choosing begins all the right stuff and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress but remember both are qualified so i ask you who are you going to pick my colleagues and i created very official terms to describe two distinct categories of candidates we call a the silver spoon the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success and we call b the scrapper the one who had to fight against tremendous odds to get to the same point you just heard a human resources director refer to people as silver spoons and scrappers which but before my human resources certification gets revoked let me explain a resume tells and over the years i 've learned something about people whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt that makes me stop and fully consider them before tossing their resumes away unpredictability or it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles at the very least the scrapper deserves an interview how will you handle the tough one person i hired felt that because he attended an elite university there were certain assignments that were beneath him but what happens when your whole life is destined for failure before i was born my father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia our lives were one part cuckoo we didn 't even have a telephone so i was highly motivated to understand the relationship between business success and scrappers because my life could easily have turned out very differently i noticed some commonality many of them had experienced early hardships anywhere from death of a parent while young to learning disabilities alcoholism and violence data revealed an unexpected insight that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation a remarkable and among a subset of six hundred and ninety eight children who experienced the most severe and extreme grew up to lead healthy successful and productive lives in spite of everything and against tremendous odds they succeeded take this resume this guy 's parents give him up for adoption he never finishes college he job hops quite a bit would you hire this guy his name is steve jobs what 's remarkable among those entrepreneurs who experience post traumatic growth they now view their learning disability as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage because they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail they don 't think they are who they are in spite of adversity they know they are who they are because of adversity they embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they 've become and know that without those experiences they might not have developed the muscle and grit required to become successful at age thirteen his parents were relocated to the countryside the schools were closed but instead of accepting his fate he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education he had three months to learn the entire curriculum and his daughters each have degrees from cornell and harvard scrappers are propelled by the belief that the only person you have when things don 't turn out well scrappers ask what can i do differently to create a better result kind of like if you 've survived poverty a crazy and finally there are relationships people who overcome adversity don 't do it alone somewhere along the way they find having someone you can count on no matter what is essential to overcoming adversity so i carpooled across two bridges with a woman who was the president 's assistant she watched me work and along the way i 've met many people who 've provided me these people don 't mind that i once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for according to a study of their top fifty companies for diversity outperformed the s & p five i say choose the underestimated contender whose secret weapons are passion and purpose hire the scrapper"
