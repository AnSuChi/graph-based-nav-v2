  "transcript": "choose grilled or fried chicken however grilled chicken poses a hidden danger the hidden danger is heterocyclic amines specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine or laughter which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound they are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines exist yet that show how or why none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet now you might wonder how a thirteen year old girl could come up with this idea and i was led to it through a series of events i first learned about it through a lawsuit i read about in my doctor 's office but they were sued because of california 's proposition sixty five turned white which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function saying that could possibly the carcinogens be and could it be due to the differences in ph so what was my next step well and i got one positive response that said that they could work with me said they didn 't have the time or didn 't have the equipment and couldn 't help me it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times however it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab so i could finally start my project amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab which is where i extracted the chemicals changed the ph so i could high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer so when compared with the unmarinated chicken which is what i used as my control which decreased the carcinogens by about ninety eight percent the saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well decreasing the carcinogens by about sixty percent but it was nearly negligible and the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens and i found that if you increase the time cooked the amount of carcinogens based on this is to and marinate in either lemon juice brown sugar or saltwater based on these findings i have a question for you would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life now i 'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that 's not marinated you 're definitely going to catch anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle is it worth it to you how will you cook your chicken 17 18 year old age category winner and then the grand prize winner and i want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant and she 's standing in front of you and she 's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they 're different colors sounds ridiculous and that was my first science fair project it got a bit more complicated from there my older brother panaki bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when i barely understood basic algebra my parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects including a remote controlled garbage can and then came the summer after my freshman year when my grandfather passed away due to cancer and i remember watching my family go through that and thinking that i never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss i decided i wanted to do cancer research so i started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab got rejected and that is where the research began so ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don 't know about or at least don 't pay that much attention to but yet it 's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the united states in fact one in seventy women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer one in one hundred will die from it involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug a relatively simple molecule made in sounds great right it 's a huge so we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called cisplatin so that 's what we set out to do and we thought it had something to do with this protein called amp kinase an energy protein when we start blocking the protein but then on this side with the same treatment they 're going up interesting but those are dots on a screen for you what exactly does that mean well basically that means that protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell and in fact and that 's huge then if we give them a chemical to block this protein then we can treat them again with the same drug so that was my work and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research with figuring out exactly what this protein does but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness so maybe all grandfathers but my work wasn 't just about the research it was about finding my passion that 's why being the grand prize winner of the google global science fair cute picture right and ever since then i 've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys and it was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing after all my story withered spinach plant and it 's only getting better from there thank you naomi i 'm naomi shah and today i 'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients point six million deaths worldwide one death every twenty seconds and the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of hiv and tuberculosis combined now these statistics had a huge impact on me but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies it confused me why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season with this question in mind i started researching and i soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit as soon as i realized this i investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic but soon after i developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients because that relationship seems so important i started researching more i started investigating more and i became very passionate because i i realized that if we could find a way to target remediation we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively for example volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools homes and workplaces they 're everywhere which is surprising to me so today i want to show you my interactive software model that i created in the audience today julie and all of julie 's data has been pre entered into my interactive software model and this can be used by anyone so i want you to imagine that you 're in julie 's shoes or someone who 's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder and the doctor has her sit down and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate i 've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels so any user can come in here and click on lung function right hand corner it shows julie 's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar this is the measurement that she took in her doctor 's office so the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar and he says wow we need to give her steroids medication and inhalers but i want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids inhalers and medication the doctor turns to julie and says why don 't you go home and clean out your air filters clean out the air ducts in your home stop the use of incense and candles and if you 're remodeling your house take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring because these solutions are natural these solutions are sustainable and these solutions are long term investments long term investments that we 're making for our generation because these environmental solutions that julie can make in but before i end my talk today i want to leave you with one saying and that saying is because what i feel is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level that we can 't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything and air quality and air air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic so i want you to reimagine a world with better air quality better quality of life thank you lauren come up really quickly your google science fair champions your winners"
