  "transcript": "today i want to talk to you about swimming across the north pole he was a great storyteller and one of the stories he told me so often when i was a young boy and he said that he could actually see an and i know every holiday i had as a young boy was in a national park what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world and show me just how fragile the world is i really really wanted to go to the arctic there was something about that place but seven years ago i went to the arctic and it was so beautiful that i 've been back there ever since for the last seven years i love the place but i have seen that place change beyond all description just in that short period of and i wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening so i decided to do this symbolic swim but which now is rapidly unfreezing and the message was very clear swimming across the north it i mean just to put it in perspective twenty seven degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool this morning the temperature of the english channel was eighteen degrees the passengers who fell off the titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade and the water at the north pole is minus one point seven it 's fucking freezing i 'm sorry but there is no other way to describe it and so i had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task and i then went and did a huge amount of training swimming in icy water backwards and forwards i had to see my coach screaming for me come on lewis come on go go go don 't slow down and so i literally swam across the north pole hundreds and hundreds of times i felt confident that i could actually do this swim i had never swum in water of minus one point seven degrees before because it 's just impossible to train in those types of conditions i have never in my life felt anything like that moment i swam as hard as i could for five minutes i remember and i remember taking the goggles off my face because my fingers and they were swollen so much i couldn 't even close them what had happened is that we are made partially of water and when water freezes it expands and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers and i thought in two days ' time i was going to i was going to try and do a and i remember then getting out of the shower and realizing i couldn 't even feel my hands and for a swimmer you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you the next morning i woke up and i was in such a state of depression and all i could think about was sir ranulph fiennes for those of you who don 't know him he 's the great british explorer a number of years ago he tried to ski all the way to the north pole he accidentally fell through the ice into the sea and he went to a local hospital and there they said ran there is no possibility of us being able to save these fingers we are going to actually have to take them off and ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and i can 't feel my hands after five minutes what on earth is going to happen if i try twenty minutes at the very best i 'm going to end up losing some fingers i didn 't even want to think about it i 've known you since you were and i know and you 're going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders lewis have the courage to go in there because we are going to look after you every moment of it and and i went down into my cabin and i put on my swimming costume and then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor which measures my core body temperature and my and there were big chunks of white ice in there and the water was completely black and i said to myself lewis don 't look left don 't look right just scuttle forward and and go for it and so i now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice everything just looks so gray around here and looks so cold the 're finally at the north pole this is months and months and months of dreaming to get here years of training and planning and preparation get in here and do my swim and the the end off by just saying this it took me four months again to feel my hands but was it worth it yes absolutely it was there are very and people ask me lewis what can we do about climate change and i say to them i think we need to do three things the first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks you saw during that video all those flags those flags every single country is going to have to make cuts japan south africa the congo all of us together we 're all on the same ship together the second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time i remember just a few years giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in south africa to young children as young as ten years old four and even in those poorest conditions they all have a very very good grasp of climate change but the most important thing"
