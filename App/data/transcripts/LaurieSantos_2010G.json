  "transcript": "i want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species the first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious and that 's that our species homo sapiens is actually really really smart like ridiculously smart like you 're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now so we like pointing out the fact that we 're smart you know so i could turn to pretty much any sage from shakespeare to stephen colbert to point out things like the fact that we 're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral we can also be incredibly incredibly dumb but of course just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples but both of these two embarrassing examples i think don 't highlight what i think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make which is that we 'd like to think that the mistakes we make but it turns out what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us when put in certain contexts will actually make very specific mistakes the errors we make are actually predictable we make them again and again and they 're actually immune to lots of and so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature what i 'm most curious about is how is a species that 's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time you know we 're the smartest thing out there why can 't we figure this out in some sense where do our mistakes really come and having thought about this a little bit i see a couple different possibilities one possibility is in some sense it 's not really our fault because we 're a smart species we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super super complicated sometimes too complicated if we are put in environments where we can 't deal with it in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up if this was the case we 'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error we 'd actually just say okay let 's figure out the kinds of technologies we can 't deal with the kinds of environments that are bad get this is a hint that i 've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors and what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way over and over if it 's us that 's messed up it 's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it we might just have to accept the fact that we 're error prone try to design things around it so this is the question my students and i wanted to get at how can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two but doesn 't have access to any of the systems we have any of the things that might mess us up no human technology human culture and so this is why we turned to these guys here these are one of the guys i work with this is a brown capuchin monkey this means that your great great great great great great with about five million greats in there grandmother was probably the same great great great great grandmother with five million greats in there as holly up here you know but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up so problems at holly see if she messes these things up first problem is just well where should we start because you know it 's great for us but bad for humans we make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts you know where are we actually going to start with this and because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news we said hhmm maybe we should actually start in the financial domain maybe we should look at monkey 's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do of course that 's when we hit a sort second problem a little bit more methodological which is that maybe you guys don 't know but monkeys don 't actually use money i know a little bit of a problem here how are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don 't actually use it so we said well maybe we should just actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money so that 's just what we did but this is the unit of currency that we 've taught our monkeys it doesn 't look like much in fact it isn 't like much like most of our money it 's just a piece of metal as those of you who 've taken currencies home from your trip know once you get home it 's actually pretty useless they actually kind of picked them up looked at them they were these kind of weird things but this is a hands it over and then gets some food it turns out not just mayday all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman so here 's just a quick video of what this looks like here 's mayday she 's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food here 's felix i think he 's our alpha male he 's a kind of big guy but he too waits patiently gets his food and goes on so the monkeys get really good at this they 're surprisingly good at this with very little training we just allowed them to pick this up on their own the you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other you might have them start paying attention to price paying attention to how much they buy sort of keeping track of their monkey token as it were and so our monkey marketplace was born the way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social when they get a hankering for some treats we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market upon entering the market it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because as the monkeys entered the door of the market a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from the salesmen were students from my lab they dressed differently they were different people and over time they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn you know who sold what at what price you know who was reliable who wasn 't and so on and you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little yellow food dish and that 's what the monkey can for a single token so everything costs one token but as you can see sometimes tokens buy more than others sometimes more grapes than others but here 's honey she 's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently all of a sudden the market opens here 's her choice one grapes or two grapes you can see honey very good market economist goes with the guy who gives more most of the monkeys went with guys who when we introduced sales we saw the monkeys paid attention to that they really cared about their monkey token dollar the more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys ' data using economic tools so much so that if you saw the monkeys ' numbers you couldn 't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might one thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving you know just like our own species the monkeys entered the market spent their entire budget and then went the monkeys would rip off the tokens at every available opportunity from each other often from us this looks bad can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do one possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out you know let 's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that take these put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you 're going to do with it because it 's yours now you can buy whatever you want donate it take it and so on sounds great but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money and here 's your choice you can either be risky in which case i 'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens if it comes up heads you 're going to get a thousand so see what your intuition is here this seems like a good bet i 'm going to go with that you might say eh that 's not really now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before think about how you 'd feel sticking it in your wallet but you 're going to get the same choice you can either take a risky loss so i 'll flip a coin if it comes up heads actually lose a lot if it comes up tails you lose nothing you 're fine get to keep the whole thing which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $ one hundred bills for certain which is when presented with these options people don 't choose to but people 's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with so what 's going on well it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level one is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms you really have to do work to figure out well one option 's a thousand two thousand one is one thousand five hundred instead we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another so we think of things as oh i 'm going to get more or oh i 'm going to get less this is all well and good except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not and this leads to the second bias which economists have called loss aversion the and this means that sometimes we 'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this what you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won 't be any loss we actually become more risky which can actually be really worrying these kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans they 're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer because they 're evaluating them in relative terms they 're why people in the housing market refused if we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market would they do the same thing as people and so this is what we did we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe they did the same thing every time or guys who were risky they did things differently half the time or pieces where they were experiencing losses they actually thought they were going to get more and so this is what this looks like we introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen the guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape so it looks pretty good but they 're going to give the monkeys bonuses sometimes the monkeys get no bonus so this is a bonus of zero but this is the same choice you guys just faced do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who 's going to do the same thing on every trial or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky but risk the possibility of getting no bonus people here played it safe turns out the monkeys play it safe too qualitatively and quantitatively they choose exactly the same way as people when tested in the same thing you might say well maybe the monkeys just don 't like risk maybe we should see how they do with losses and so we ran a second version of this now the monkeys meet two guys who aren 't giving them bonuses they 're actually giving them less than they expect so they look like they 're starting out with a big amount these are three grapes the monkey 's really psyched for this but now they learn these sometimes he gives no loss so the monkeys are really psyched but sometimes he actually big loss taking away two to give the monkeys only one the remarkable thing to us is that when you give monkeys this choice they do the same irrational thing that people do they actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started this is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they and they do very similar things with it they do some of the smart things we do some of the but they also do some of the irrational things we do they systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do this is the first take home message of the talk which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought oh i 'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser they 're way cuter than the one at you know don 't do that they 're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have so you know the reason you 're laughing is bad for humans too because we 've answered the question we started out with we wanted to know where these kinds of errors came but what we 've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that in fact they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history you know if we believe the capuchin monkey results means that these duncey strategies might be million years old that 's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around really really old what do we know about other old strategies like this well one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome you know think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things fatty things like cheesecake you can 't just shut that off you can 't just look at the dessert cart as say no no no that looks disgusting to me we 're just built differently we 're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after my guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving when you 're watching your stocks plummet into the red when you 're watching your house price go down you 're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms this means that the biases that lead investors to do badly that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome the good news i think is which is that humans are not only smart we 're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom we i 'm wearing contact lenses now so that i can see all of you i don 't have to rely on my own it was camus who once said that man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is but the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them the hope is that you all will think about your limitations not necessarily as unovercomable but to recognize them accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out that might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species"
