  "transcript": "i took on the task to teach global development to swedish undergraduate students that was after having spent about twenty years together with african institutions studying hunger in africa and but when you get that opportunity you get a little nervous i thought these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swedish college systems so i thought maybe they know everything i 'm going to teach them about so i did a pre test when they came and one of the questions from which i learned a lot was this one which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs and this means that i won 't put you at a test here but it 's turkey which is highest there and i got happy of course a one point eight right answer out of five possible that means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course but one late night when i was compiling the report i really realized my discovery i have shown that swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees because the chimpanzee would score the problem for me was not ignorance it was preconceived ideas i did also an unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute that hands out the nobel prize in medicine and they are on par with the chimpanzee there laughter this is where i realized that there was really a need to communicate because the data of what 's happening in the world every bubble here is a country because my students what they said when they looked upon the world and i asked them what do you really think about the world well i first discovered that the textbook was tintin mainly the world is still ' we ' and ' them ' and ' we ' is western world and ' them ' is third world and third world is short life and large family we have very and sixty about on the size of families in all countries the error margin is narrow here i put life expectancy at birth from thirty years in some countries up to about seventy years and one thousand nine hundred and sixty two there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries and they had small families and long lives and these were the developing countries they had large families and they had relatively let 's see we stopped the world then this is all u n statistics that have been available here we go can you see there it 's china there moving against better your yellow ones here are the arabic countries and they get you have bangladesh but now bangladesh it 's a miracle that happens in the ' 80s the imams start to promote family planning they move up into that corner and and we have a completely new world states of america and vietnam america had small families and long life vietnam had large families and short lives and this is what happens the data during the war indicate that even with all the death there was an improvement of life expectancy by the end of the year the family planning started in vietnam they went for smaller families and the united states up they give up we have in vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in vietnam two thousand and three as in united states one thousand nine hundred and seventy four by the end of the war which was in social change before we saw the economical and if we look where the income ends up this is one hundred percent the world 's annual income and the richest twenty percent they take out of that about and this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful and who are this is this is oecd the rich country the country club of the u n and they are over here on this side quite an overlap between africa and oecd and we can put east asia and we put south asia and how did it look like if we go back in time to about one thousand nine hundred and seventy and we will not have a divided world we 'll have most people in the middle of course it 's a logarithmic scale our concept of economy is growth with percent we look upon it as a possibility of and i turn these and i take the regions down here the size of the bubble is still the and we can by adding the linearity is very strong between child survival and money but let me split sub saharan africa health is there and better and i can split mauritius there 's a huge difference between africa and ghana is here in the middle sierra leone humanitarian aid here in it 's a tremendous variation within africa which we rarely often make but a huge difference between afghanistan and sri lanka i can split arab states which was quite equally and well used not as the myth is and that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country today we don 't have to go to cuba to find a healthy country in latin america chile will have a lower child mortality than cuba within some few years from now and if we look at it how the world looks and then so it 's sort of sort of difficult to get an but i would like to bring you back to about here which is there and you can see how south korea is making a very very fast advancement whereas brazil you can see again that the speed of development is very very different and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first and but health cannot be bought at the supermarket he brought so we 've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past now this is more or less if you look at the average data of the countries because there is such a lot of so if i go and look here we can see that uganda the poorest are down there and if i go down and look at niger where there was such a terrible famine lastly it everything in this world exists in africa and you can 't discuss universal access to hiv [ medicine ] for that quintile up here with the same strategy we find that students get very excited when they can use this and even more policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see see how why doesn 't this take place why are we not using the data we have we have data in the united nations in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other but we have still not used it effectively all that information we saw changing in the world does not include some web pages like this you know but they take some nourishment down from the databases but people put prices on them stupid passwords and boring statistics and this won 't work so we started a nonprofit venture which and we started to write software which could link the data like this and we have produced animations you can take a data set and put but what we really need is of course a search function a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world this can 't be done our information is so peculiar in detail that cannot be searched as others can be searched we cannot give the data free to the students free to the entrepreneurs of the world but this is what we would like to see isn 't it and i have good news for you i have good news that the present new head of u n statistics he doesn 't say it 's impossible he only says we can 't do it and that 's a quite clever guy huh so we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years we will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways this is the income distribution of the united states one thousand nine hundred and seventy almost no overlap and what has happened what has happened is this that china is growing it 's not so equal any longer almost like a ghost isn 't it it 's pretty scary but i think it 's very important to have have all this information we need really to see it and instead of looking at this i would like to end up by showing the internet users per one thousand software we access about five hundred variables from all the countries quite easily it takes some time to to change for this but on the axises you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have and the thing would be to get up the databases free to get them searchable and with a second click to get them into the graphic formats where you can instantly because they say that this will not show the the reality we have to have statistical analytical methods but this is there the internet is this is the gdp per capita and it 's a new technology coming in but then amazingly how well it fits to that 's why the $ one hundred computer will be so important but it 's a"
