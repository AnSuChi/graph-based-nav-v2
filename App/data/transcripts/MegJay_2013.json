  "transcript": "26 year old woman named now when i heard this i was so relieved my classmate got an arsonist for her first client and i got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys this i thought i could handle but i didn 't handle it with the funny stories that alex would bring to session it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road and as far as i could tell she was right work happened later marriage happened later kids happened later even death happened later twentysomethings like alex and i had nothing but time i said sure she 's dating down she 's sleeping with a knucklehead but it 's not like she 's going to marry the guy but she might marry the next one besides the best time to work on alex 's marriage is before she has one and we were sitting there blowing it and it had real consequences not just for alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere there are fifty million twentysomethings in the united states right now we 're talking about fifteen percent of the population or one hundred percent if you consider that no one 's getting through adulthood without going through their raise your hand if you 're in your 20s i really want to see some twentysomethings here oh yay you are all awesome if you work with twentysomethings you love a twentysomething you 're losing sleep over twentysomethings i want to see awesome twentysomethings really matter so i specialize in twentysomethings because i believe that every single one of those fifty million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists sociologists neurologists and fertility specialists maybe even for the world this is not my opinion these are the facts we know that eighty percent of life 's most defining moments take place by age that means that eight out of ten of the decisions and experiences and aha moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your people who are over forty don 't panic this crowd is going to be fine i think we know that the first ten years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you 're going to earn we know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself now is the time to change it and we know that female fertility peaks at age twenty eight and things the time to educate yourself about your body so when we think about child development we all know that the first five years are a critical period it 's a time when your ordinary day to day life has an inordinate impact on who you researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence journalists coin silly nicknames for leonard bernstein said that to achieve great things you need a plan and not quite enough time isn so what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say you have ten extra years to start your life and then every day smart interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this i know my boyfriend 's no good for me but this relationship doesn 't count i 'm just killing time or they say everybody says as long as i get started on a career by the time i 'm thirty i 'll be fine but then it starts to sound like this my 20s are almost over and i have nothing to show for myself i had a better rsum the day after i graduated from college and then it starts to sound like this but then sometime around thirty it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down i didn 't want to be the only one left standing up so sometimes i think i married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at thirty where are the twentysomethings here but make no mistake the stakes are very high when a lot has been pushed to your 30s there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump start a career pick a city and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s it 's realizing you can 't have that child you now want or you can 't give your child a sibling too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves and at me sitting across the room and say about their 20s what was i doing what was i thinking i want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking it 's a story about a woman named emma emma came to my office because she was in her words having an identity crisis so she 'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead 20s were her early life had been even harder she often cried in our sessions but then would collect herself by saying you can 't pick your family but you can pick your friends well one day emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap and she sobbed for most of the hour but then she 'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words case of emergency please call she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said who 's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck who 's going to take care of me if i have cancer now in that moment it took everything i had not to say i will but what emma needed wasn 't some therapist who really really cared emma needed a better life i knew this was her chance i had learned too much since i first worked with alex to just sit there while emma 's defining decade i told emma three things that every twentysomething male or female deserves to hear first told emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital by get identity capital i mean do something that adds value to who you are do something that 's an investment in who you might want to be next but i do know this identity capital which by the way is not exploration best friends are great for giving rides to the airport but twentysomethings who huddle together with like minded peers limit who they know what they know how they think how they and where they work so yes half of twentysomethings are un or under employed but half aren 't and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group it 's not cheating it 's the science of how information spreads i told emma the time to start picking your family is now or even and i agree with you but grabbing whoever you 're living with or sleeping with when everyone on facebook starts walking down the aisle is the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want so what happened to that weak tie helped her get a job there that job offer gave her the reason to leave that live in boyfriend and she sent me a card that said now the emergency contact blanks don 't seem big enough now emma 's story made that sound easy but that 's what i love about working with twentysomethings they are so easy to help bound for somewhere west right after takeoff a slight change in course is the difference between landing in alaska or fiji or even twenty nine one good conversation one good break one good ted talk can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come so here 's an idea worth spreading to every it 's as simple as what i learned to say to alex it 's what i now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like emma every single day thank you"
