  "transcript": "studied international agriculture studied and then i took a turn and ended up now if you get a ph d and you decide not to teach you don 't always end up in a place like this it 's a choice what i found was i started working with refugees and famine victims small farmers all or nearly all now what i 'd been trained to do was methodological research on such people so i did it i found out how many women had been raped en route to these i found out how many people had been put in jail how many family members had been killed i assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them and i got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need so i was at a grateful dead benefit concert on the rainforests he said what can i do to save the rainforests i said well ben what do you do i make ice cream so i said well you 've got to make and you 've got to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are worth more as forests than they are as pasture he said okay within a year rainforest crunch was on the shelves we did our first million dollars worth of trade by buying on thirty days and selling on twenty one that gets your adrenaline going then we had a four and a half million dollar line of credit because we were at that point we paid two to three times more than anybody else everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise a great success fifty companies signed up two hundred products came out generated one hundred million in sales why did it fail because the people who were gathering brazil nuts weren 't the same people who were cutting the forests and the people who made money from brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests we needed to be working on soy things that we were not focused i often talk to refugees why was it that the west didn 't realize that famines are caused by policies and politics not by weather and this farmer said to me one day something that was very profound he said you can 't wake a person who 's pretending to sleep we live there 's just one of them we 've got to wake up to the fact that we don 't have any more we know the limits of the resources we have there 's a basic equation that we can 't get away from population times consumption has got to have some and right now it 's a simple not equal since one thousand nine hundred and ninety we crossed the line of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet now we 're at one point three if we were farmers we 'd be eating our seed for bankers we 'd be living off the principal not the interest this is where we stand today a lot of people like to point so when the average american consumes it 's not just about population peer reviewed methodology that 's that 's bulletproof yet but there 's very good evidence that the average cat in europe has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime than the average african you think that 's not a question as to how we should be using the earth 's resources let 's go back and visit our equation in two thousand we had six billion people on the planet they were consuming what they were consuming let 's say one unit of consumption each we have six billion units of consumption by two thousand and fifty we 're going to have nine billion people all the scientists agree they 're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do scientists again agree because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today on global average about [ two point nine ] so we 're going to have eighteen billion units but that 's what the math says we 're not going to be able to do that we need to use less to make more and then we need to use less but it basically raises a fundamental question should consumers have a choice about sustainability should you be able to buy a product that 's sustainable sitting next to one that isn 't or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable if they should all be sustainable on a finite how do you make that happen the average consumer takes one point eight seconds in the u s okay so let 's be generous let 's say it 's three point five seconds in europe how do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product the data that 's changing on a weekly if not a daily basis how do you get informed you don 't here 's a little question from a greenhouse gas perspective is lamb u k is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef do organic potatoes actually have fewer toxic chemicals used to produce them than conventional potatoes in every single case the answer is it depends it depends on who produced it and how but they 're not going to be terribly informed sustainability has got to be a it 's got to be something we all care about and we need collusion we need greenpeace to work with wwf everybody 's got to work together china and the u s we need to begin to manage this planet as if our life depended on it because it does the what and the who so the where we 've identified thirty five places globally that we need to work these are the places that are the richest in biodiversity and the most important from an ecosystem function point of view we have to work in these places we have to save these places if we want a chance in hell of preserving biodiversity as we know it we looked at the threats to these places these are the fifteen commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation soil loss water use so we 've got thirty five places we 've got fifteen priority commodities who do we work with to change the way those commodities are produced are we going to work with six point nine billion consumers let 's see that 's about seven thousand languages three hundred and fifty major languages a lot of work there i don 't see anybody actually being able to do that very effectively are we going to work with one point five billion producers three hundred to five hundred companies control seventy percent or more of the trade of each of the fifteen commodities that we 've identified as the most this is nine of them we lined them up side by side and we put the names of the companies that work on each of those and if you go through the first twenty five or thirty names of each of the of the commodities so we did the analysis again a slightly different way if we take the top hundred companies what percentage of all fifteen commodities do they touch buy or sell and what we found is it 's twenty five percent so one hundred companies control twenty five percent of the trade of all fifteen of the most significant commodities on the planet because if these companies demand sustainable products they 'll pull forty to fifty percent of production companies can push producers faster than consumers can by companies asking for this we can leverage production so much faster we can 't wait that long we don 't have that kind of time we need we need to begin to work with we bring in civil what is a global benchmark what 's an acceptable impact and design standards around that we eventually got i think sixty percent of global production at the table and twenty five percent of demand at the table three of the original eight entities were suing each other and yet next week we launch globally verified vetted and certified standards for salmon it 's risk and demand they care about availability so the big risk for them is not having product at all the good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago in the last eighteen months we 've signed agreements with forty of those hundred companies to begin to work with them on their supply chain and in the next eighteen now what we 're doing is bringing the ceos of these eighty companies together because they don 't like ngos they 've never worked with ngos they 're concerned about this they 're concerned about that but we all need to be in this together so we 're pulling out all the stops we 're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table one company we 're working with that 's begun in baby steps perhaps but has begun this journey on sustainability is cargill they 've funded research that shows and do it all in borneo alone by planting on land that 's already degraded the study shows that the highest net present value for they 're also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third party certified under a credible why is cargill important because cargill has twenty to twenty five percent of global palm oil if cargill makes a decision the entire palm oil industry moves or at least forty or fifty percent of it that 's not insignificant more importantly cargill and one other company ship fifty percent of the palm oil that goes to china we don 't have to change the way a single chinese company works if we get cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to china it 's a pre competitive issue all the palm oil going there is good buy it now most people understand that mars is a chocolate company but mars has made sustainability pledges to buy only certified product for all of its seafood it turns out mars buys more seafood than walmart because of pet food but they 're doing some really interesting things around chocolate and it all comes from the fact that mars wants to be in business in the future and what they see is that they need to improve chocolate production on any given plantation twenty percent of the trees produce eighty percent of the crop so mars is looking at the genome they 're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant they 're doing it with ibm and the and they 're putting it in the public domain because they want everybody to have access to this data because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable what they 've realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance they can produce three hundred and twenty percent as much cocoa on forty percent of the land the rest of the land can be used for something else it 's more with less and less again they don 't want to be an i p company the price of food many people complain about but in fact the price of food is going down and that 's odd because in fact if you take a look just at water what we see is that if you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid the farmer didn 't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of an externality by definition this is the subsidy from nature they 're entering into 17 year contracts with growers in turkey they 're also buying the carbon in the trees to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon to get the product into europe we need to take what we 've learned in private voluntary standards of what the best producers in the world are doing and use that to inform government regulation we can 't just focus on identifying the best we 've got to move the rest there 's no turning back we 're all on that same journey with them we have to really begin to change the way we think whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine thank you"
