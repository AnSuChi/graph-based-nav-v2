  "transcript": "might think there are many things that i can 't do because i cannot but there is also a lot that i can do this is me rock climbing for the first time i love sports and i can play many sports like swimming skiing skating scuba diving running and so on but there is one limitation somebody needs to help me i i was an active independent teenager and suddenly i became blind the hardest thing for me was losing my independence things that until then back then there were no personal computers no internet no smartphones so i had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks and i had to create my own books in braille can you imagine of course my brothers were not happy about it and later i i really wanted to be freed from relying on someone jump ahead to how come there is no computer technology to these amazing technologies that 's the moment my innovation journey began this may not surprise you since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in two fifteen but braille went digital many years before digital books already in the late almost thirty years ago strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity and this is actually because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation the telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities now i 'm going to give you another example from my own life in the ' 90s people around me started talking about the internet and web browsing i could even search desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the internet and i found ways which dramatically simplified the user interface this led me to develop the home page reader in i got many comments from users one that i strongly remember said for me the internet is a small window to the world it was a revolutionary moment for the blind the cyber world way beyond what i imagined it can help drivers listen to but it is still not enough when i approached the stage just now i needed assistance and not just here ok now let me show you the latest technologies this is a smartphone app that we are working on ev take the two doors to go out the door is on your right looks so happy he is not talking to you dark chocolate with almonds ev you gained five pounds since yesterday app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors but the computer vision part in which mood we are still working on that part and recognizing facial expressions we call this cognitive assistance it understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities in other words our five senses enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street it will be amazing if i can find you on the street before you notice me and yours so this really is a great challenge it is a challenge that needs collaboration which is fundamental technologies you just saw in the video the frontier is the real world the blind community is exploring i hope to work with you to explore the new era and the next time that i 'm on this stage thank you so much"
