  "transcript": "that guy get to sit down that 's because this is radio music i tell mascots and wayfinding and fonts my mission is to get people to engage with the design that they care about so they begin to pay attention to all forms of design instead of seeing the broken things you see all the little bits of genius that anonymous designers have sweated over to make our lives better and few things give me greater joy than a and people are like i don 't care about flags and then we start talking about flags and trust me one hundred percent of people care about flags there 's just something about them that works on our emotions my family wrapped my christmas presents as including the blue gift bag that 's dressed up as the as the flag of scotland i put this picture online and sure enough within the first few minutes someone left a comment that said you can take that scottish saltire and shove it up your ass laughter see people are passionate about flags you know that 's the way it is what i love about flags is that once you understand the you can understand the design of almost anything so what i 'm going to do here is i cracked open an episode of my radio show ninety nine % invisible and i 'm going to reconstruct it here on stage so when i when i press a button over here it 's because i pressed a keep it simple the i didn 't even know cities had their own flags tk most larger cities do have flags rm well i didn 't know that that 's ted kaye by the way tk hello rm he 's a flag expert he 's a totally awesome guy tk i 'm ted have edited a scholarly journal on flag studies and i am currently involved with the portland flag association and the north american how to design a great flag rm and that first city flag i discovered in chicago is a beaut the river and the lake narrator the flag 's images colors or pattern should relate to what it symbolizes tk the red stars represent significant events in chicago 's history rm namely the founding of fort dearborn on the future site of chicago the great chicago fire the world columbian exposition which everyone remembers because of the white city which no one remembers at all narrator red white blue green yellow and black rm the design of the chicago flag has complete municipal building flies the flag whet moser there 's probably at least one store on every block near where i work that sells some sort of chicago flag paraphernalia rm that 's whet moser from chicago magazine wm today just for example i went to get a haircut and when i sat down in the barber 's chair there was a chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in guy passed me who had a chicago flag badge on his backpack rm it 's adaptable and remixable the six pointed stars in particular show up in all kinds of places wm the coffee i bought the other day had a chicago star on it rm it 's a distinct symbol of chicago pride tk when a police officer or a firefighter dies in chicago often it 's not the flag of the united states on his casket that 's how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of chicago rm and it isn 't just that people love chicago and therefore love the flag i also think that people love chicago more because the flag is so cool tk a positive feedback loop there between great symbolism so when i moved back to san francisco in two thousand and eight i researched its flag because i had never seen it i am sorry to say sadly lacking keeping it simple narrator the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory tk it 's a relatively complex flag rm the main component of the san francisco flag is a phoenix representing the city rising from the ashes after the devastating fires of the 1850s tk a powerful symbol for san francisco rm i still don 't really dig and then it has a substantial gold border around it tk which is a very attractive design element never use writing of any kind iron in war plus and this is the big problem it says san francisco across the bottom tk if you need to write the name of what you 're representing on in fact country flags they but they obey good design principles because the stakes are high they 're on the international stage regional flags are another story there is a scourge of bad flags and they must be stopped that is the truth and that is the dare the first step is to recognize that we have a problem but sometimes it isn 't all right here 's the full list of nava flag design principles four tk no lettering or seals narrator never use writing of any kind tk because you can 't read that at a distance narrator number five tk and be distinctive rm they would say these principles deep meaning having few colors or being thoughtful about colors uniqueness don 't have writing you can 't read all those principles apply to them too our biggest problem seems to be that fourth one we just can 't stop ourselves from putting our names or little municipal seals with tiny writing on them here 's the thing about municipal seals they were designed to be on pieces of paper where you can read them not on flags one hundred feet away flapping in the breeze so here 's a bunch of flags again vexillologists call these sobs seals on a bedsheet and that 's exactly the problem except for anaheim apparently they fixed it these flags are everywhere in the us us the european equivalent of the municipal seal is the is the city coat of arms now if this were a united states city the flag would probably look like this you know yeah but instead the flag of amsterdam looks rather than plopping the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing amsterdam below it they and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world and because it 's so badass those flags and crosses are found nothing can quite prepare you for one of the biggest train wrecks in the city ran a contest and gathered a bunch of submissions with all kinds of designs sk and an alderman by the name of fred steffan cobbled together parts of the submissions to make what is wants to change it sk it 's it 's a misstep 's behalf to say the least rm but what puts the milwaukee flag over the top almost to the point of self parody is on it is a picture of the civil war battle flag of the milwaukee regiment sk so that 's the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous that there is a flag design within i 've been there i love it the most depressing part of this flag though is that there have been two major redesign contests the last one was held in two thousand and one one hundred and five entries were received tk but in the end the members of the milwaukee arts board decided that none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city rm they couldn 't agree to change that thing you think that good design and democracy just simply do not go together but steve kotas is going to try one more time to redesign the milwaukee flag sk i believe milwaukee is a great city every great city deserves a great flag rm steve isn 't ready to reveal his design yet one of the things about proposing these things is you have to but here 's the trick start by drawing tk a three by five foot flag on a pole one hundred feet away looks about rectangle seen about fifteen inches from your eye you 'd be surprised by how compelling and simple the design can be back in san francisco is there anything we can do tk i like to say that in every bad flag there 's a good flag trying to get the way to make san francisco 's flag a good flag is to take the motto off because you can 't read that at a distance take the name off and i would simply take the phoenix and make it a great big element in the middle of the flag rm but the current phoenix that 's got to go tk emphasize those flames this san francisco flag was designed by frank chimero based on ted kaye 's suggestions i don 't know what he would do if we was completely unfettered and didn 't follow those guidelines fans of my radio show and podcast heard me complain about bad flags they 've sent me other suggested designs this one 's by neil mussett both are so much better i would see them around the city in my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted but maybe it does and i dare you to join the effort to try to change that but also it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself especially today as the populace is becoming more design aware and i think design awareness is all time high a well designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city considers all of its design systems its public transit but it 's not tk often when city leaders say we have more important things to do than worry about a city if you had a great city flag you would have a banner for people to rally under to face those more important things rm i 've they are an but instead by having bad flags we don 't use we cede that territory to sports teams and chambers of commerce and tourism boards sports teams can leave and break our don 't really care about sports and tourism campaigns can just be cheesy and when that flag is a beautiful thing that connection is a beautiful thing cedar rapids finally when we 're all done we can do something about pocatello idaho considered by the north american vexillological association as the worst city flag in north america that hurts me just to look at thank you so much for listening"
