  "transcript": "six thousand miles of road six hundred miles of subway track four hundred miles of bike lanes and a half a mile of tram track if you 've ever been to roosevelt island these are the numbers that make up the of new york city these are the statistics of our infrastructure they 're the kind of numbers you can find released in reports by city agencies for example the department of transportation will probably tell you how many miles of road they maintain the mta will boast how many miles of subway track there are most city agencies give us statistics this is from a report this year from the taxi and limousine commission where we learn that there 's about thirteen but did you ever think about where these numbers came from because for these numbers to exist city agency had to stop and say hmm here 's a number that somebody might want want to know here 's a number that our citizens want to know and then they put out reports and those reports will have numbers like this in some ways there 's literally an infinite number of questions that we can ask about our city the agencies can never keep up so the paradigm isn 't exactly working and i think mayor bloomberg signed into law what he called the most ambitious and comprehensive open data legislation in the country so you go and look at data like this and instead of just counting the number of cabs we can start to ask different questions and i thought to myself these cabs aren 't just numbers these are gps recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every ride they take speed increases and at that point things turn around and and it turns out it stays that way for the entire day so i said to myself i guess there 's no rush hour in new york city there 's just a rush day for a couple of reasons if you 're a transportation planner but there 's a story behind this data this data wasn and they will notify you and a guy named chris whong and they told him just bring a brand new hard drive down to our office leave it here for five hours we 'll copy the data and you take it back and that 's where this data came from now chris is the kind of guy who wants to make the data public and so it ended up online for all to use and that 's where this graph came from and the fact that it exists is amazing these gps recorders really cool and we can do better than that as a city we don 't need our citizens walking around with hard drives now so the red areas are more dangerous and what it shows is first the east side of manhattan especially in the lower lower area of manhattan and this is exactly the kind of data we need for vision zero this is exactly what we 're looking for yeah i see some shakes have you ever tried to copy and paste data out of a pdf and make sense of it i see more shakes more of you tried copying and pasting than knew the logo i like that in fact hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of pdf put out by our very own nypd or you could be john john krauss was like i 'm not going to copy and paste this data i 'm going to write a program it 's called the nypd crash data and then people could make maps like because then we 're having our citizens write pdf scrapers it 's not the best use of our citizens ' time and we as a city can do better than that now the good news is that the de blasio administration actually recently released this data a few months and so now we can actually have access to it but there 's a lot of data still entombed in pdf for example our crime data is still only available in pdf and not just our crime data our own city budget and it 's not just us that can 't analyze it our own legislators who vote for the budget also only get it in so our legislators cannot analyze the budget that they are voting for and i think as a city we can do a little better than that as well now how do i measure dirty well it 's kind of a little weird but i looked at the level of fecal coliform so the large circles are dirty water the small circles are cleaner what you see is inland waterways and the bigger circles are dirty and i learned a few things from this number one never swim in anything that ends in creek or canal in coney but coney island creek ninety four percent of samples taken over the last five years have had fecal levels so high but the fact that we can get to that data is awesome if you were to go to the open data portal you 'd see just a snippet of it and we 're getting there because there 's this website that socrata makes called the problem is once you do you will find so one is street name intersection street street borough address building building address we can do better than that as a city but not just any fire hydrants these are the top two hundred and fifty grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets laughter so i learned a few things from this map and i really like this map number one just don 't park on the upper east side just don 't it doesn 't matter where you park you will get a hydrant ticket and that seemed a little strange to me when i noticed it so i did a little digging and it turns out what you had is a hydrant which is like a seven foot space to walk on and the nypd disagreed with this designation and would ticket them this is the google street view car driving by so i wrote about while the dot has not received any complaints about this we will review the roadway markings and make any appropriate alterations and typical government response all right moved on with my life but then a few weeks later something incredible happened they repainted the spot and for a second i thought i saw the future of open data because think about what happened here for five years this spot was being ticketed and it was confusing and then a citizen found something they told the city and within a few weeks we can empower our citizens to be better partners for government and it 's not if you 're foiling data if you 're seeing your data being foiled over and over again and if you 're a government agency releasing a pdf let 's pass legislation that requires you to post it with the underlying data because that data is coming from somewhere i don 't know where but it 's coming from somewhere and you can release it with the pdf and let 's adopt and share some open data standards let 's start with our addresses here in new york city let 's just start normalizing our addresses because new york is a leader in open data despite all this we are absolutely a others will follow the state will follow and maybe the federal government and we 're not that far off from a time where you could write one program and map information from one hundred countries it 's not science fiction we 're actually quite close because it 's not just john krauss and it 's not just chris whong there are hundreds of meetups going and they 're attending these meetups to look at open data and betanyc who just last week released something called that allows you to subscribe to three hundred and eleven complaints around your own home or around your office you put in your address you get local complaints it 's everyone it 's citizens from a diverse set we can unlock the passion and the ability of our citizens to harness open data and make our city even better whether it 's one dataset"
