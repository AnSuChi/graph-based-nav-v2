  "transcript": "and that 's not surprising given the bad news all around us from isis to inequality and on and on i actually don 't buy this gloomy narrative i read the same headlines that you do why do i say this it 's not like i 'm particularly optimistic by nature but something about the media 's constant doom mongering with its fixation on problems and not on answers i 'm i should see if i can do any better by and what i found astonished me and they 've convinced me that our great global challenges may not be so unsolvable after all not only are there theoretical fixes i 'm going to show you what i mean by telling you about how three of the countries i visited canada indonesia and mexico overcame three supposedly impossible problems their stories matter because they contain tools the rest of us can use and not just for those particular problems for many others too canada today if they think about canada at all they think and that 's all true because of its triumph over a problem currently tearing many other countries apart immigration consider canada today is among the world 's most welcoming nations even compared to other immigration friendly countries its per capita immigration rate is four times higher than france 's and its percentage of foreign born residents is double that of sweden ten times more syrian refugees in the last year than did the united states and now canada is taking even more and yet if you ask canadians what makes them proudest of their country they rank now here 's the really interesting part canada wasn 't always like canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy they were not just talking about the snow despite what my mom in ontario will tell you the answer had nothing to do with virtue canadians inherently better than anyone else the real explanation involves the man who became canada 's leader in pierre trudeau who is also the father of the current prime minister he was a french he was an intellectual he was even kind of but he nevertheless pulled off one of the most progressive transformations any country has ever seen his formula i 've learned involved two parts first canada threw out its old race based immigration rules and it replaced them with new ones that emphasized education then part two trudeau created the world 's first policy of official multiculturalism to promote integration and the idea that diversity was the key to canada 's identity but at the same time ordinary canadians soon started to see the economic the material benefits of multiculturalism all around them and these two influences soon combined to create the passionately open minded canada of today let 's now turn to another country and an even tougher problem islamic extremism suharto but it was also a scary one with two hundred and fifty million people indonesia is the largest muslim majority country on earth it 's also hot huge and unruly and he 'd always been careful to keep religion out of politics so experts feared that without him keeping a lid on things the country would explode or religious extremists would take over and turn indonesia into a tropical version of iran and that 's just what seemed to happen at first while ordinary folks folks have grown more pious on a personal level i saw a lot more headscarves on a recent visit than i would have a decade ago and yet its islamist parties have steadily lost support from a high of about thirty eight percent in two thousand and four down to twenty five percent in two thousand and fourteen far fewer in per capita terms try to think of one other muslim majority country that can say all those same things in two thousand and fourteen i went to indonesia to ask its current president many other muslim states are dying well what we realized he told me is that to deal with extremism we needed to deal with inequality first see indonesia 's religious parties like similar parties elsewhere had tended to focus on things like reducing poverty and cutting corruption so that 's what joko and his predecessors thereby stealing the islamists ' thunder so they waged their war with extraordinary delicacy they even sent liberal imams into the jails to persuade the jihadists that terror is un islamic so at this point neither immigration nor islamic extremism are impossible to deal with join me now on one last trip this time to mexico now of our three stories this one probably surprised me the most since as you all know the country is still struggling with so many problems and yet a few years ago mexico did something that many other countries from france to india to the united states can still only dream of it shattered the political paralysis that had gripped it for years to understand how we need to rewind to the year two thousand rather than use their new freedoms to fight for reform mexico 's politicians used them to fight one another crime corruption spun out of control the pentagon warned that mexico risked collapse but he came from mexico 's corrupt old ruling party the pri and he was a notorious and yet this same bombn soon surprised everyone by hammering out a truce between the country 's three warring political parties they liberalized its rusting energy sector they restructured its failing schools and much more try to imagine congress doing it all at the same time that 's what mexico did not long ago i met with pea and asked how he managed it all the president flashed me his famous twinkly smile and told me that the short answer was compromise of course i pushed him for details and the long answer that came out was essentially compromise compromise and more compromise see pea knew that he needed to build trust early so he started talking to the opposition just days after his election to ward off pressure plus a lot of shared tequila that helped build confidence and that pea even agreed to pass some of the other party 's priorities before his own as santiago creel an opposition senator put it to me but that group that was special and that 's very nice for them right but well in the course of studying these and a bunch of other success stories like the way rwanda pulled itself back together after civil war or brazil has reduced inequality or south korea has kept its economy growing faster and for longer than any other country on earth i realize of course that all countries are unique so you can 't simply take what countries and in boardrooms and in all sorts of other contexts too and that was no coincidence take canada when trudeau took office he faced two looming dangers first though his vast underpopulated country badly needed more bodies its preferred source for white workers europe had just stopped exporting them as it finally recovered from world war ii countries face crises all the time 's nothing special but trudeau 's genius was to realize that canada 's crisis had swept away all the hurdles that usually block reform and that gave trudeau a he was smart enough to seize it number two there 's power in promiscuous thinking they 'll steal the best answers from wherever they find them and they don 't let details like party or ideology sentimentality get in their way but and it got them mixed up in all of and that hurt their image so badly that they 've never recovered and that 's true often requires more than just boldness it takes showing restraint too just when that 's the last thing you want to do he could have pleased some of the people all of the time and pea could have used his power to keep attacking the opposition as was traditional in mexico while forcing his own party to compromise and trudeau pushed everyone to stop thinking in tribal terms and to see multiculturalism not language and not skin color as what made them quintessentially canadian but everyone got just enough so at this point you may be thinking are out there like you keep insisting then why aren 't more countries already using them none of the leaders we 've just looked at were superheroes and they all had plenty of flaws take indonesia 's first democratic president abdurrahman wahid this man was so powerfully uncharismatic that he once fell asleep making big changes involves taking big risks and taking big risks is scary the answers are out there but now it 's up to us to elect more women and men brave enough to find them to steal them and to make them work thank you"
