  "transcript": "getting a college education is a investment when you 're growing up poor you 're not accustomed to thinking that far ahead instead you 're thinking about where you 're going to get your next meal and how your family is going to pay rent that month besides my parents and my friends ' parents seemed to be doing just fine driving taxis and working as janitors it wasn 't until i was a teenager when i realized i didn 't want to do those things by then i was two thirds of the way through my education and it was almost too late to turn things around i was no different i 'm the second oldest of seven and was raised by a single mother on government aid in queens new york by virtue of growing up low income my siblings and i went to some of new york city 's most struggling public schools because i didn 't feel like going to class my high school had a only twenty percent of the kids graduating were college ready i told my friend brennan how our teachers would always ask us to i 've never been asked that question before it was always what college are you going to just the way that question is phrased made it unacceptable for him nowadays i get asked a different question how were you able to make it out for years but it 's not just luck when my older brother and i graduated from high school at the very same time and he later dropped out of a two year college i wanted to understand why he dropped out and i kept studying it wasn 't until i got to cornell as a presidential research scholar that i started to learn about the very real educational consequences of being raised by a single mother on government aid i also learned that our most admirable education reformers people like arne duncan the former us secretary of education or wendy kopp the founder of teach for america had never attended an inner city public school like i had where people are saying let 's go and help these poor inner city kids or these poor black and latino kids where someone like me who had grown up in this environment could say i know the adversities that you 're facing i share that one of the biggest reasons is that i wasn 't ashamed to ask for help there 's a good chance that a parent or a teacher will come to their rescue however if that same kid is growing up poor and doesn 't ask there 's a good chance that no one will help them there are virtually no social safety nets available i started to reform our public education system shaped by my firsthand perspective and i started with summer school research tells us could be directly attributed to the summer learning loss in low income neighborhoods kids forget almost three months of what they learned during the school year over the summer they return to school in the fall and their teachers spend another two months reteaching them old material that 's five months the school year in the united states is only ten months if kids lose five months of learning every single year that 's half of their education half but traditional summer school is poorly designed for kids it feels like punishment and for teachers it feels like babysitting but how can we expect principals to execute an effective summer program when the school year ends the last week of june and then summer school starts just one week later there just isn 't enough time to find the right people sort out the logistics and design an engaging curriculum that excites kids and teachers but what if we created a program over the summer that empowered teachers as teaching coaches to develop role models as teaching fellows what if empowered high achieving kids as mentors to tutor their younger peers and inspire them to invest in their education what if we empowered all kids as scholars asked them what colleges they were going to designed a summer school they want to attend trained over three hundred aspiring teachers and created more than one thousand seasonal jobs across some of new york city 's most disadvantaged neighborhoods our kids are succeeding two years of independent evaluations tell us that our kids eliminate the summer learning loss and make growth of one month in math so instead of returning to school in the fall three months behind they now go back four months ahead in math and five months ahead in reading ten years ago if you would have told me that i 'd graduate in the top ten percent of my class from an ivy league institution i would have said thank you"
