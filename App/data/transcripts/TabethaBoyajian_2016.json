  "transcript": "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and it is my job my responsibility as an astronomer to remind people that alien hypotheses always be a last resort now i want to tell you a story about that it involves ordinary people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy it began in two thousand and nine with the launch of nasa 's kepler mission kepler 's main scientific objective was to find planets outside of our solar system it did this by staring at a single field in the sky this taking a data point every thirty minutes it was looking for what astronomers call a transit this is when the planet 's orbit is aligned in our line of sight just so that the planet crosses in front of a star and so the team at nasa had developed very sophisticated computers to search for transits in all the kepler data and so we launched the citizen science project called planet hunters to have people look at the same data however there was a lot of skepticism around this there 's no way that a computer will miss a signal we would be thrilled we had already found a couple and today with the help of over three hundred so to understand this let me show you what a normal transit in kepler data looks like on this graph on the left hand side you have the amount of light and on the bottom is and the depth of this transit reflects the size of the object itself and so for example let 's take jupiter planets don 't get much bigger than jupiter jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star 's brightness earth on the other hand is eleven times smaller than jupiter and the signal is barely visible in the data so back to our mystery a few years ago planet hunters were sifting through data looking for transits and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star the observations in may of two thousand and nine were the first they spotted and they started talking about this in the discussion forums they said and object like jupiter would make a but they were also saying it was giant it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side this seemed to indicate that we see this which would only make a one percent drop after this not much happens until there is a huge and they last for like a hundred days all the way up into the kepler mission 's end and there 's also up and down trends within some of these dips almost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other and at this time this star drops in its brightness when they saw this they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up there 's probably just something wrong with the data but we looked really really really hard and and so what was happening had to be astrophysical meaning that something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight and so at this point we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on and the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand you know what if but the difficulties were that the star showed no signs of being young and you would expect this how about it ends up that this is actually consistent with our you see it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we 're observing and so in reality we 're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets but and so we went ahead and published our findings and so we decided to give it a catchy title and we called it where 's the flux i will let you work out the acronym and he was saying that with kepler 's extreme precision but it didn 't and then i showed him this weird data that our citizen now i have to rewrite my paper so yes the natural explanations were weak proposal to observe the star with the world 's largest radio telescope at the green bank observatory news of this proposal got leaked to the press this is what this civilization would have exhausted the energy supply of their home planet they have a host star just like we have a sun this image above are lots of artists ' impressions but you can think of it this way the earth moon distance is a quarter of a million miles the simplest element on one of these structures is one hundred times that size they 're enormous and now imagine one of these structures in motion around a star you can see how it would produce anomalies but it remains that even alien megastructures cannot defy the laws of physics you see anything that uses a lot of energy but it could be something as simple as they 're just reradiating it away in another direction another idea that 's one of my personal favorites but if we 're already invoking aliens in this explanation then who is to say they didn 't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes you can see how this quickly captures your imagination well there you have it we 're in a situation that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we don 't understand or an alien technology we don 't understand personally as a scientist either way there is something new and really interesting to discover we need to continue to observe this star to learn more about what 's and i 'm happy to say that once again citizen scientists have come in and saved the day amateur astronomers with their backyard telescopes stepped up immediately and started observing this star nightly at their own facilities and am so excited to see what they find and what 's more exciting is that there 's more data to come there are new missions that are coming up that are observing millions more stars all over the sky and just think and what will it mean if we don 't find another star like this thank you"
