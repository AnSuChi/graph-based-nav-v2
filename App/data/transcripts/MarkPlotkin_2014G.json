  "transcript": "a scientist who works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants i 've been doing this for a long time and i want to tell you these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do and better than we ever will these indigenous cultures are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves and the greatest and most endangered species in the amazon rainforest is not the jaguar it 's not the harpy eagle it 's the isolated and uncontacted tribes now four years ago i injured my foot in a climbing accident narcotic painkillers cortisone shots it didn 't work and the shaman said you he looked me in the face and he said take off your shoe and give me your machete the pain disappeared and i 've been cured for three years now who would you rather be treated by now make no mistake western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised but there 's plenty of holes in it where 's the cure for breast cancer where 's the cure for schizophrenia where 's the cure for acid reflux where 's the cure for insomnia fact is that these people can sometimes sometimes sometimes cure things we cannot here you see a medicine man in the northeast amazon treating leishmaniasis a really nasty protozoal disease they 're expensive this is the magic frog he was rescued by a group of isolated indians called the matss they beckoned for him to follow them into the forest which he did there they took out palm leaf baskets there they took out these green monkey frogs these are big suckers they 're like this and they began licking them it turns out they 're highly hallucinogenic mcintyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of high times magazine you see this guy decided he would go down to the amazon and give it a whirl or give it a lick and he did felt like god for two days an italian chemist read this and said i 'm not really interested in the theological aspects of the green monkey frog what 's this about the change in blood pressure and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug resistant staph aureus i took him to los angeles to meet a foundation officer looking for support for monies to protect their culture this fellow looked at the medicine man and he said you didn 't go to medical school did you i cure them the venom of which was studied at the universidade de so paulo here causes over ten percent of all deaths on the planet every day this is a $ four billion there 's a saying in suriname that i dearly love hold answers to questions we have yet to ask i took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the xingu indigenous reserve in the state of mato grosso to the northwest of here the line through the middle is the eastern bottom half carbon in the atmosphere where it 's driving climate change in fact the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere it 's important to keep in mind that the amazon is the mightiest landscape of all it 's a place of beauty and wonder the goliath bird eating spider is the world 's largest spider it 's found in the amazon as well and the black cayman they 're known to be man eaters the largest rodent a specimen from here in brazil tipped the scale at two hundred and one pounds uncontacted peoples these are the people who know nature best these are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature by our standards some would dismiss these people as primitive they don 't know how to make fire or they didn 't when they were first contacted but they know the forest far better than we do and other indians look up to them as being the true masters of the emerald realm here you see the face of my friend pohnay when i was a teenager rocking out to the rolling stones in my hometown of new orleans pohnay was a forest nomad roaming the jungles of the northeast amazon in a small band this is what you find worshipped the forest all that 's left is an imprint in stone as you see here let 's move to the western each of these dots represents a small uncontacted tribe and the big reveal today is we believe there are fourteen or fifteen isolated groups in the colombian amazon alone obviously some of this was set off in but at the turn of the last century was the rubber trade set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush rubber for automobile tires and the man on the left julio arana is one of the true thugs of the story and other companies like them even today when people come out of the forest the story seldom has a happy ending these are nukaks they were contacted in the 80s within a year everybody over forty was dead and every time a shaman dies it 's as if the drug traffickers have taken over the nukak lands live as beggars in public parks in eastern colombia chiribiquete national park it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the colombian government and colombian colleagues it has now expanded it 's bigger than the state of maryland it is a treasure trove of botanical diversity flying over realize that these lost world mountains are still lost no scientist has been atop them in fact nobody has been atop the bell mountain since end up here with the bell mountain just to the east of the picture let me show you what it looks like today but it 's the greatest treasure trove of pre colombian art in the world the dutch scientist thomas van der hammen described this as the sistine chapel of the amazon rainforest but down to the southeast again in the colombian amazon remember the colombian amazon is bigger than new england the amazon 's a big forest and brazil 's got a big part of it but not all of it moving down to these two national parks cahuinari and pur in the colombian amazon that 's the brazilian border to the right it 's home to several groups of isolated and uncontacted peoples to the trained eye you can look at the roofs of these these longhouses and see that there 's cultural diversity these are in fact different tribes as isolated as these areas are let me show you how the outside world is crowding in the outside world is showing up to the north we have illegal gold mining also from the east from brazil and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into brazil here 's why this is an art exhibit in havana cuba a group called los carpinteros this is their perception of why you shouldn 't mess with uncontacted indians these are mashco piros on the brazil peru border who stumbled out of the jungle because they were essentially chased out by drug runners they will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture of course when you give them clothes when you give them tools you also give them diseases we call these inhuman safaris they want to get in there and turn them into christians we know how that turns out what 's to be done this is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom and 21st century technology we 've done this now mapped managed and increased protection of over seventy million acres of ancestral rainforest they also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out this is a picture of actual contact they were shot at is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today and it has to stop but let me conclude by saying this work can be spiritually rewarding but it 's difficult and it can be dangerous two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash so the question is in conclusion is what the future holds let 's make a better world let 's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation can maintain that mystery let 's live in a world where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs thanks again"
