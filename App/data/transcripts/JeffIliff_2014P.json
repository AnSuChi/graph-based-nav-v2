  "transcript": "but do any of us really understand what it 's all about two thousand years ago galen one of the most prominent medical researchers animating them but leaving the brain all dried up and he thought that when we sleep all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back rehydrating the brain but galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that it clears your mind so today i want to tell you about some recent research that may shed new light on this question we 've found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution so almost all the biology that we observe in the brain that is especially critical its intense electrical activity uses up a quarter of the body 's entire energy supply even though the brain accounts for only about two percent of the body 's mass so the circulatory system solves the nutrient delivery problem by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to every corner of our body and then they and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve which has evolved to meet this need but if you look really closely at so if we were to zoom into this guy 's head one of the things that you would see there but that that doesn 't make a lot of sense does it it lacks lymphatic vessels which means that the approach that the rest of the body takes to clearing away its waste so how then does the brain solve its waste clearance problem well that seemingly mundane question and what we found as we dove down into the brain down it was really unexpected it was ingenious so the brain has this large pool of clean clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid we call it the csf the csf fills the space that surrounds the brain and wastes from inside the brain make their way out to the csf which gets dumped along with the waste into the blood so in that way it sounds a lot like the lymphatic system doesn 't it instead there is a specialized network of plumbing that organizes and facilitates this process the frame on your left shows what 's happening at the brain 's surface and the frame on your right shows what 's happening down below the surface of the brain within the tissue itself we 've now what was surprising to us was that the instead the csf was pumped back into and through the brain it was actually helping to clear away to clean the waste from the spaces between the brain 's cells if you think about it using the outsides of these blood vessels like this because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it 's packed full of cells so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system they extend from the surface of the the lymphatic vessels to make it so you don 't need them and what 's amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells this is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain but our most surprising finding was that all of this everything i just told you about with all this fluid rushing through the brain it 's only happening in the sleeping brain here the video on the left shows how much of the csf is moving through the brain of a living mouse while it 's awake it 's almost nothing what we see is that the csf is and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep so it seems that galen may actually have been sort of on the right track when he wrote about fluid rushing through the brain when sleep came on suggests that what 's it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode to clear away the waste from the spaces between its so it 's actually a little bit like how you or i we put off our household chores during the work week when we don 't have time to get to it and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do when the weekend rolls around but i haven 't been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing during sleep in order to stay healthy the waste product that these recent studies focused most on is but in patients with alzheimer 's disease amyloid beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain 's cells instead of being cleared away like it 's supposed to be and it 's this buildup of amyloid beta that 's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease so if sleep then is part of the brain 's solution to the problem of waste clearance then this may dramatically change how we think about the relationship between sleep amyloid beta and alzheimer 's disease and while it 's important to point out that these studies don 't prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause alzheimer 's they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid beta may contribute to the development of conditions like alzheimer 's so what this new research tells us then is that the one thing that all of you already knew about sleep that even galen understood about sleep that it refreshes and clears the mind may actually be a big part of what sleep is all about they never rest while our body is still the elegant machinery of the brain is quietly hard at work cleaning and maintaining this unimaginably complex machine like our housework but it 's also important in your house if you stop cleaning your kitchen for a month the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty which is why understanding these very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow"
