  "transcript": "and the first thing i wanted to do as a muslim was to go to mecca and visit the kaaba the holiest shrine of islam and i did that i put on my ritualistic dress i went to the holy mosque i did my prayers i observed all the rituals and if you wonder why because this a country and i noticed this in a very funny way i left the kaaba to eat something in and i went there i had to pay order and eat in the male section it 's funny i said to myself you can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy kaaba but not at the burger king because the kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the but apparently that was not an issue at the time so the rituals came that way this is also i think confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the koran the very core of because many scholars who study the history of islamic thought muslim scholars or westerners think that actually the practice of dividing men and women physically came as a later development in islam adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the middle east seclusion of women was actually a byzantine and persian practice and muslims adopted it and made it a part of their religion actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon what we call today islamic law and especially islamic culture and there are many islamic cultures actually the one in saudi arabia is much different from if you 're going to speak about a muslim culture but then many traditions perceptions practices were added on top of it and these were traditions of the middle east medieval traditions or two lessons to take from that reality first of all muslims pious conservative believing muslims who want to be loyal to their religion should not cling onto everything in their culture thinking that that 's divinely mandated maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed on the other hand the westerners who look at islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what islam ordains maybe it 's a there is a practice called female circumcision it 's something terrible horrible it is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure and westerners europeans or americans who didn 't know about this before [ saw ] this practice and they 've thought what a horrible religion that is which ordains something like that but when you look at female circumcision you see that it has nothing to do with islam it 's just a north african practice it was there for thousands of years but also the non muslim communities of north africa the animists so what might look like a problem within islamic faith might turn out to be a tradition that muslims have subscribed to the same thing can be said for honor killings which is a recurrent theme in the western media and which is of course now these are things about general culture but i 'm also very much interested in political culture and whether liberty and and it is no secret that many islamic movements in the middle east tend to be authoritarian and some of the so called islamic regimes such as saudi arabia iran and the worst case the taliban there a phenomenon called the religious police and the religious police imposes the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen by force like women are forced to cover their heads wear the hijab the islamic head cover now that is pretty authoritarian and that 's something i 'm very much critical of but when i realized that the until very recently we used to have what i call secularism police which would guard the universities against veiled in other and i think forcing people to uncover their head is but when i saw that i said maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region and some muslims have been influenced by that but the secular minded people can be influenced by that maybe it 's a problem of the political culture and we have to think about how to change that political culture i said well i will do research about how islam actually and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken the name of the book is islam without extremes a muslim case for liberty i looked at islamic tradition and the history of islamic thought from the perspective of individual liberty and i tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty and there are strengths in islamic tradition but besides that again traditions the troubling aspects of islamic law were later interpretations of islam which means that muslims can today look at those things and say well it 's our faith and we will be loyal to it but we can change how it was interpreted because it was interpreted according to the time and milieu in the middle ages now we 're living in a different world with different values and political systems that interpretation is quite possible and feasible but that 's not the case at all actually from the 19th century a whole revisionist reformist whatever you call it a trend in islamic thinking these were intellectuals or statesmen the idea of representation the idea of and they looked back at islamic tradition and saw that there are problematic aspects but they 're not the core of the religion so maybe they can be re understood and the koran can be reread that trend is generally called islamic which then covered the whole middle east made very important reforms advancing the idea of freedom of religion that 's why the ottoman empire in its last decades turned into a proto democracy a constitutional monarchy and freedom was a very important political value at the time he has a book arabic thought in the liberal age and the liberal age he defines as 19th century and early but there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the 20th century because we see a sharp decline in this islamic modernist line and in place of that what happens is that islamism grows as an ideology so islamism is the problematic idea that that really and even the very extreme forms of islamism led to terrorism in the name of islam which is actually a practice that but there is a curious question if islamic modernism was so popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries why so popular in the rest of the 20th century and actually you don 't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that look at the political history of the 20th century and you see things have changed a lot the contexts have changed and when you have colonialization what do you have you have so europe is not just an example now to emulate it 's an enemy to fight and to resist so and when the colonial period ended what you had in in place of that was and i think the west at least some powers in the west particularly the united states made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators thinking that they were more helpful for their interests but the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed islamic groups in their country actually made where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle and that 's the country where i come from turkey turkey has never been so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the ottoman empire that 's one thing to remember which was in the beginning of turkey and the pious muslims in turkey saw that they could change the political system by voting and they realized that democracy is something compatible with islam compatible with their values and they 've been supportive of democracy thanks to the rise of a middle class we in turkey see what i define as a rebirth of islamic modernism again look at their tradition and see that there are some problems in the tradition they see an example at least to take some inspiration from that 's why the eu process turkey 's effort to join the eu has been supported inside turkey by the islamic pious while some secular nationalists were against it well that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all europeans are that welcoming but that 's another discussion turkey has been able to reasonably create reasonably create a success story in which islam and the most pious understandings of islam have become part of the democratic game and even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country and this has been an inspiring example right now for some of the islamic movements or some of the countries in they were asking for democracy they were asking for freedom and they did not turn out to be the islamist boogeyman that the dictators were always using to but we want to be living as free people in free societies of course this is a long road democracy is not an overnight and i believe that the islamic modernism which began in the 19th century but which had a setback in the 20th century because of the political troubles of the muslim world and i think the takeaway message from that would be that islam thanks so much"
