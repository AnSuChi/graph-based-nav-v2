  "transcript": "and so many people i guess watch those videos people have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce which is a wonderful thing in the short term laughter but it 's proven to be less than ideal over seven years and so i though i would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me the theme of this morning 's session is things we make and so i thought i would and expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small exquisite he 's an engineer he goes to the federal polytech in zurich expensive exquisite objects and he 's a swiss important 16 hour days and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness and he drinks lots of coffee and he does his best work sitting in his mother 's kitchen in zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule in any case carl norden emigrates to the united states just before the first world war and sets up shop on lafayette street and he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane now if you think about it in the age before gps and radar that was obviously a really difficult problem it 's a complicated physics problem and you 're trying to drop an object a bomb towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments and all sorts of people and he comes up with this incredibly complicated device it weighs about fifty lbs it 's called the norden mark fifteen bombsight and it has all kinds of levers and ball bearings and gadgets and gauges and he makes this complicated thing and what what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier visually sight the target target because they 're in the plexiglas cone of the bomber the speed of the wind and and the coordinates and the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb and as norden famously says before that bombsight came along he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at twenty thousand ft now i cannot tell you how incredibly excited the u s military was by the news of the norden bombsight it was like manna from heaven here was an army that had just had experience in the first world war where millions of men fought each other in and here someone had come up with up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy and to put that in perspective the total cost of the and there were people strategists within the u s military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the nazis and against the japanese and for norden as well this device had incredible moral importance because and what was god 's will well god 's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible so in the years leading up to the second world war the u s military buys ninety thousand of these norden bombsights and they trained fifty thousand bombardiers on how to use them long extensive and they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy because it 's imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely it 's escorted there by a series of armed and there 's a little incendiary device inside of it so that if the plane ever crashes it will be destroyed and there 's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it so what happens during the second world war well it in practice the norden bombsight can drop a in wartime conditions aren 't perfect first of all it 's really hard to use really hard to use and not all of the people who are of those fifty thousand men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer it 's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball bearings and they don 't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle well in a real war get shot down but of course what happens in real life there are clouds right it needs cloudless sky to be really accurate well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above central europe between and forty five not a lot and the chemical and over the course of twenty two ten percent the leuna chemical plant after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war was up and running within weeks and well it turns out that so in the 1930s he hired a whole bunch of them gave a complete set of the plans for the norden bombsight to the nazis so they had their own norden bombsight throughout the entire war which also by the way didn 't work very well well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of norden bombsights we live in a time where there are all kinds of really really smart people running around saying that they 've invented gadgets that will forever change our world they 've invented websites that will allow people to be free they 've invented some kind of this thing or this thing or this thing that will make our world forever better if you go into the military you 'll find lots of carl nordens as well if you go to the pentagon they will say you know what now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at twenty thousand ft they actually can do that now but we need to be very clear about how little that means in the iraq war at the beginning of the first iraq war the u s military the air force sent two squadrons of of f 15e fighter eagles to the iraqi desert equipped and their mission was to find and to destroy remember the scud missile launchers those surface to air missiles that the iraqis were launching at the israelis and after the war was over there was an audit done as the army always does the air force always does and they asked the question how many scuds did we actually destroy you know what the answer was they could have destroyed this little thing right here from twenty five thousand ft the issue was they didn 't know where the it 's knowing how to find the pickle barrel or take the battle in afghanistan what is the signature weapon of the cia 's war in northwest pakistan it 's the drone well it is the grandson of the norden mark fifteen bombsight it is this weapon of and over the course of the last six years in northwest the cia has flown hundreds of drone missiles and it 's used those drones to kill two thousand suspected pakistani well it 's extraordinary ninety five percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes ninety five percent of the people we kill need to be killed right that is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare but do you know what the crucial thing is in that exact same period that we 've been using these drones with devastating accuracy the number of attacks of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks against american forces in afghanistan has increased tenfold they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us and this is the problem with our our infatuation with the things we make we think the things we make can solve our problems but our problems are much more complex than that whether you ought to use bombs at all there 's a postscript to the norden story of carl norden and his fabulous called the enola gay flew over japan the bomb actually missed its target by eight hundred ft but of course bombsight which didn 't need a bombsight at all he thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of it would have broken his heart"
