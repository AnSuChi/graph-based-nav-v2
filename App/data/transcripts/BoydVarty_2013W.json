  "transcript": "and so just before i get going i wanted to tell you as a south african nelson mandela and so this talk is going to be for him i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called 's a place where my family has been in the safari business and so i think it 's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering and so what i have to share with you today is the simple medicine now my stories are not the stories that you 'll on the news and while it 's true that africa is a harsh place i also know it to be a place where people animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world when i was nine years old president mandela came to stay with my family members of and it 's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi he would go for a walk around the garden at night i would sit with my family around the snowy bunny eared tv and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people he was bringing peace to a divided and violent south africa one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think harmony through this act of immense open heartedness he was to become the embodiment of what in south africa we call am because of you or people are not people without other people it 's not a new idea or value but it 's one that i certainly think at these times is worth building on in fact it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions ubuntu is at play right now you are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who i am without you i 'm just a guy talking to an empty room and i spent a lot of time last week doing that and it 's not the same as this if mandela was the national and international embodiment then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man born under a tree sixty kilometers from where i grew up in mozambique he would never have a lot of money but he was to be one of the richest men i would ever meet but it makes for the first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks he had learned to do that out in the bush i have no idea but he could do it he then moved across into what we called the habitat team he did some anti poaching and then one day we were out together but for fun he turned and he began to follow it and i tell you i could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a solly somewhere out on the reserve you look up in your rearview mirror you 'd see he 'd stopped the car twenty fifty meters down the road just in case you need help with something the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said pathologically helpful when i started professionally guiding people out into this environment and the first guests we ever got and they said to solly on the side they said before we even go out to see lions and leopards we want to see where you live so we took them up to his house and this visit of the philanthropist to his house welcome i love you laughter and there was something so beautifully african about it to me this small house with a on the day it was a hot day and i walked into the water solly remained on the bank the water was clear and we turned and we began to make our way upstream people in the audience would have started saying don 't go in there don 't go in there now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite wham it hits me by my and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that laughter i notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream as it bites the second time i kick my foot goes down its throat it spits me out i pull myself up into the branches and as i come out of the water i look over my shoulder my leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description the bone is cracked the meat is torn up i make an instant decision that i 'll never look at that again as i come out of the water and i can tell you this man doesn 't slow down for one second he comes straight into the channel he and i survive now know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa in a more collective society we realize danger is shared food is shared ubuntu now although the root word is and then i met this young lady her name was elvis in fact solly gave her the name elvis because he said she walked like she was doing she was born with very badly deformed back she arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route and yet for the next five years and then we would come around the corner and there she would be with her herd and that outpouring and it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection and i watched as the matriarch and she began to make her way up the steep bank the rest of the herd turned and i watched young elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill she got visibly ears came forward she had a full go of it and halfway up her legs and he began to shovel her up the bank and it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant the next day i watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and then she would break a second one and a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant elvis and the herd taught me and it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity if africa has a gift to share and while it 's true that ubuntu is an african idea what i see thank you that you knew president mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today and deeply distraught and and know the tragic loss that it is to the world but i just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session boyd but i just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the oprah show and asked her what the show would be about and everything they used to call it madiba magic you know he used to go to a rugby match and we would win anywhere he went things went well but i think that magic will be with us and and so that 's what and that 's what people all over south africa are trying to do"
