  "transcript": "thousands of years from now we 'll look back at the first century of computing as a fascinating but very peculiar time the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2d space interacting with technology as if we were machines a singular 100 year period in the vastness of time where humans we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens what happened to interacting with each other know about you but i feel limited inside this 2d world of monitors and pixels and it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people a reality where technology a reality where people not devices but instead embraces who we are i dream of technology on a human this this is microsoft hololens the first fully untethered holographic computer devices like this enhancing the way we experience life we are already seeing car companies like volvo designing cars differently with hololens universities like case western redefining the way medical students learn personal favorite nasa is using hololens to let scientists explore planets holographically now this is important i 'm talking about freeing of traditional computing we 're like cave people in computer terms we 've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures i invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us now as i put this hololens on let me explain the setup a little bit it 's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage with hololens and i can 't think of a better place to am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage just as clearly as i can see all of you we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors so let 's start our journey and what better place to begin our journey than the computer universe is both marvelous it 's a universe based on causality double click on an icon now when we compare this to our physical universe it because our universe is not digital our universe is analog true or false or black or white exist in a world governed by quantum physics a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray so why are screens so pervasive in our analog life within the digital universe we have the power to displace space and the power to displace time productivity or communication let 's all go home tonight this is theater time and space displaced as soon as i 'm done with this ted talk i 'm going to immediately call my lovely family in seattle now these are such great superpowers that we put up with the but what if we didn 't have to what if we could have these same digital powers in our but i believe our children 's children will grow up in a world devoid of 2d technology 's remarkable to dream of this world a world where technology truly understands us work and communicate with tools that enhance the human experience not machines that limit our humanity so how do we get there it required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine how would you actually break the problem down you 'd probably try to classify things as a human an environment but how would that machine then interact secondly or output information into reality holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment from an output perspective i could exchange energy with the world via haptics now imagine being able to feel the of a virtual object or better yet imagine pushing a hologram we are able to collapse reality now here 's a secret as an engineer i get really excited anytime i can reduce something to the matrix from self driving cars to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head machines are capable of understanding our world and they are starting to interact with us in significantly now imagine move the dial one way move the dial the other way now imagine dialing your entire environment between virtual and real worlds down here now imagine if i could look at all of you and dial from real humans when technology truly understands our world it will again transform the ways we interact the ways we work and the ways we play less than half a century ago two courageous men landed on the moon using six hundred million humans watched them on grainy black and white televisions the world was mesmerized now imagine how our children and their children will experience the continued exploration of space with technology that understands and i can already see holographic telepresence in our near future in fact since we 've been lucky with our demo so far let 's try doing something else even more i invite you here on the ted stage between me and my friend dr jeffrey norris from nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory can you tell us a little bit jeff about where you are jn well i 'm while i 'm standing on this stage with you while i 'm standing on mars a this is crazy can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data from mars is coming from jn this is a precise holographic replica of mars built from data captured by the curiosity mars rover that i can explore as easily as a place on earth we can instantly understand an environment just by being present in it we 've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards now we 're leaping over all of that over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there a group of scientists on our mission are seeing mars as never before because they 're finally exploring it as humans should but our dreams don 't have to end with making it just like being there we can see in invisible wavelengths or teleport to the top of a mountain perhaps someday we 'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it we 're taking the first steps but we want the whole world to join us in taking the next because this is not a journey for a this was amazing thank you so much for joining us on the ted stage today i dream about this future we used to live in tribes where we interacted communicated we are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today technology and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in so there 's been some talk in the press and i 'll just ask you straight then we have a straight answer there 's been talk about the difference between the demos and the reality of the commercial product talk about this field of view issue is this is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get ak it 's a great question or said better this is a question we 've been receiving in the media for possibly the last year if you do your research i haven 't answered that question i 've purposely ignored it because ultimately it 's the wrong question to ask that 's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the then saying what 's the size of your television the field of view for the product is almost irrelevant what we should be talking about is the density of lights or radiance that shows up better said what the angular resolution is of the things that you see so from that perspective what you saw you know the camera is wearing a hololens so even if i wanted to cheat i can 't hw but the camera has a different lens on it than our eye right so if you think about the points of light but the angular resolution of the holograms that you see the points of light per unit of area are actually the same hw so you spent jeff i 'll get to you in a minute so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage ak that 's right hw so if i buy a hololens and have it at home i don 't need to map my apartment right ak the hololens maps in real time at about five frames per second with this technology that we call spatial mapping so in your home as soon as you put it on holograms will start showing up and you 'll start placing them and they 'll start learning your home we don 't take the risk of so what we do is pre map the stage at five frames per second and then we store it so that when there 's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this between the camera hololens and that one is just viewing the hololens so if i lose connectivity on mars you were here you were in a room across the street tell me more about the the fact that with holograms my question for a hologram jn thanks for the and that 's why we 're using them in multiple parts of our work at nasa we 're also using it for our astronauts on the space station we 're even using it now to design the next generation of our spacecraft please go away thank you very much"
