  "transcript": "like to talk about is something how do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as as a person because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place and the uniqueness of a program in a building and so i 'll take you to wichita kansas where i was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site right downtown the site was separated from the river by mclean boulevard so i suggested let 's reroute mclean and that gave birth instantly to friends of mclean boulevard and it took six months to reroute it the first image i showed the building committee was this astronomic observatory of jantar mantar in in jaipur because i talked about what makes a building a building of science it 's an instrument had something to do with science and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that and so my first sketch after i left was to say let 's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building and i got all excited and came back and they sort of looked at me in dismay and said an island this used to be an island ackerman island and we filled in the channel during the depression to create jobs and so the process began and they said you can 't put it all on an island some of it has to be on the mainland because we don 't want to turn our back to the community and peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced come back and pay the five dollars admission and the client was happy well sort of happy because we were four million dollars over the budget it was complex but there was something capricious about compositional complexity and i felt that if i had to fulfill what i talked about a building for science there had to be and this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building a toroid the surface of a doughnut and and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits and and when there were complaints about budget i said reflections and here 's the building as it and the bike route 's going right through the building so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building every beam in this building is the same radius every piece of the building works these are the galleries with the light coming in through the i was asked to design a children 's memorial museum in a holocaust museum in yad vashem in jerusalem which i was asked to do a building and i was given all the artifacts of clothing and and drawings and i felt very troubled i worked on it for months and i couldn 't deal with it because i felt people were coming out of the historic museum they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with information it would make we tunnel into the hill descend through the rock into an underground chamber there 's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished there is a single candle flickering in the center by an arrangement of you walk through the space a voice reads the names ages and place of birth of the children this voice does not repeat for six months and then you descend to light and to the north and to life and it sat there for ten years and then one day abe spiegel from so many years after that in i was on one of my monthly trips to jerusalem and i got a call from the foreign ministry saying we 've got the chief minister we took him on a he 's demanding to meet the could you come down and meet him in tel aviv and i went down and chief minister badal said to me we are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people we 're about to embark on that i 'd like you to come and design it and so you know it 's one of those things that but two weeks outside chandigarh the capital of the punjab and the temple and also next to it the fortress died in as he wrote the khalsa which i got to work and they took me somewhere down there nine kilometers away from the town and the temple and said that 's where we have chosen the location and i said this just doesn 't make any sense let 's get back to the town and walk to the site and i recommended they do it right there on that hill and the site was purchased within a week and we were working and my proposal was to split the museum into two the permanent exhibits at one end the and changing exhibitions on the other and the structures rise from the sand cliffs they 're built in concrete and sandstones the roofs are stainless steel they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself and as you come from the north it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from the himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress and then i went away for four months and i came back and lo and behold the little model i 'd left behind had been built ten times bigger for public you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning i was renamed at work and it will be finished in two years back to yad vashem three years ago after all this episode began yad vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum because now washington was built the holocaust museum in washington and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information and yad vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point they said let 's rebuild the museum but of course the sikhs might give you a job on a platter phase one phase two phase three and again i felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion that a building the size of the washington building fifty thousand square feet will sit on that fragile hill and that we will go into galleries and i proposed that we cut through the mountain that was my first sketch just cut the whole museum through the mountain enter from one side of the mountain come out on the other side of the mountain and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers and you cross a bridge you enter this triangular which cuts right into the hill and extends right through as you go towards the north and all of it then all the just one line of light cuts through the mountain which is a skylight on top of that and the natural rock when possible with the light shafts this is actually a spanish which sort of inspired the kind of spaces that these galleries could be it opens up it bursts out of the mountain into again a view of light and of the city and of the jerusalem hills i 'd like to conclude with a project i 've been working on for two months it 's the headquarters for the institute of peace you see it there directly on the mall it 's the last building on the mall on access of the roosevelt bridge that comes in from virginia it is something i 'm just beginning to work on if it were to be anywhere in washington it would be an office building a conference center a place for negotiating peace and so on all of which the building is but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the mall and by the lincoln memorial this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the mall and that was a lot of heat to deal with the first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces spaces where research goes on conference centers a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry you see the structure as in the sequence of structures on the mall very transparent and inviting and looking in looking in all directions towards the city and what i felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being to quote kundera that it had to do with whiteness it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism and this is where it is it 's sort of how to make it how to give some kind again of order a structure not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that and so it goes i 'd like to conclude by saying something i 'd like to conclude by relating all of what i 've and i know it is not a fashionable term these days and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools but it seems to me that all this in one way or the other is a search for beauty i have a quote that we call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness the perfect fulfillment of function nevertheless beauty as the kind of fit something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled and our human environment for that which seems to me to still hold for me today he who seeks order shall find gratification he who seeks he who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of he who seeks self expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance if we seek truth we shall find beauty"
