  "transcript": "i was born in den bosch where the painter hieronymus bosch named himself after and i 've always been very fond of this painter and what is interesting about him in relation to morality is that he lived at a time where religion 's influence was waning and he was sort of wondering i think what would happen with society if there was no religion or if there was less religion and so he painted this famous painting the garden of earthly delights which some have interpreted as and what kind much later as a student i went to a very different garden a zoological garden in arnhem where we keep chimpanzees this is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee and at that time the focus in a lot of animal research was on basically i 'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it but they surely seemed interested in the book now in the process of doing all this work on power and dominance and aggression and so on i discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights they came together in the fork of the tree and kissed and embraced each other and this is very interesting because at the time everything was about competition and aggression so it wouldn 't make any sense the only thing that matters is that you win or you lose reconcile after a fight that doesn 't make any sense but the principle is exactly the same the principle is that you have so you need to do something about it so we have this image in political science economics the humanities i think it 's a very unfair image for the wolf and it 's really unfair to humanity because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic than given credit for so these are the pillars of morality if you ask anyone what is morality based on these are the two factors that always come out one is reciprocity and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness and the other one is empathy and compassion and so let me give you a few examples here this and you can see that they 're synchronized you can see that they work together they pull at the same moment it 's already a big advance over over many other animals who wouldn 't be able to do that now you 're going to get a more interesting picture because now one of the two chimps so one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore now look at what happens at the very end of this the second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he 's not interested in the food why would that be well that probably has to do with we do the same task with elephants now it 's very dangerous to work with elephants another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant now you can probably make it but it 's going to be a pretty clumsy apparatus and so what we did in that case we do these studies in thailand for josh plotnik is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope a single rope and if you pull on this side of the rope the rope disappears on the other side so two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time and pull otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears and they pull together so it 's actually fairly simple for them there they are but now we 're going to make it more difficult purpose of this experiment is to see how well they understand cooperation do they understand that as well as the chimps for example what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope because if he pulls at the rope it disappears and the whole test is over but it shows the understanding he has because he puts his big foot stands on the rope and waits there for the other and but it shows they developed several of these alternative techniques that we did not approve of necessarily so the other elephant is now coming and is going to pull it in it doesn 't forget to eat of course this was the cooperation and reciprocity part this is just a regular definition the ability to understand empathy has basically two channels one is the body channel if you talk with a sad person you 're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture and before you know it you feel sad and that 's sort of the body channel your average dog has that also that 's why people keep mammals in the home and not turtles or snakes or something like that who don 't have that kind of empathy and that 's more limited very few animals i think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing which is part of that whole empathy mechanism is a very old one in the animal kingdom it activates the same areas in the brain also we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic people who have problems with empathy such as autistic and we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head so that 's what you see on the upper left an animated head that yawns and there 's a chimpanzee watching an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations laughter so yawn contagion that you 're probably all familiar with and maybe you 're going to start yawning soon now and that 's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy and that is universal in the mammals basically we also study more complex expressions this is consolation this is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he 's screaming and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him and calms him down that 's consolation it 's very similar to human consolation and consolation behavior it 's empathy driven actually the way to study empathy in human children is to instruct a family member to act distressed and then to see what young children do and so it is related to empathy and that 's the kind of expressions we look at we also recently published an experiment you may have heard about on altruism and chimpanzees where the question is do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else and for now we did a very simple experiment we do that on chimpanzees that live in lawrenceville in the field station of yerkes and so that that 's how they live and we call them into a room and do experiments in this case we put two chimpanzees side by side and one has a bucket full of tokens and the tokens have different meanings one kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses the other one feeds both of them so they have a whole bucket full of them which is the red token in this case he we put it on a table where there 's two food rewards but in this case only the one on the right gets food the one on the left walks away because she knows already that this is not a good test for her then the next one is the pro social token so she gives us now a pro social token and both so it doesn 't matter whatsoever and she should actually be choosing blindly but what we find is that they prefer the pro social token so and especially if the partner draws attention to itself they choose more and if the partner puts pressure on them so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them then choices go down it 's as if they 're saying if you 're not behaving i 'm not going to be pro social today and this is what happens without a partner when there 's no partner sitting there so we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well being of somebody else especially these are other members of their own group famous study and there are now many more because after we did this about ten years ago it became very well known and we did that originally with capuchin monkeys and i 'm going to show you the first experiment that we did it has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees but with sarah brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys so what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys and there 's a very simple task that they need to do and if you give both of them cucumber for the task the two monkeys side by side they 're perfectly willing to do this twenty five times in a row so cucumber even though it 's only really water in my opinion but perfectly fine for them now if you give the partner grapes the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket and so if you give them grapes it 's a far better food then you create inequity between them thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction and that turned out to be right the one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber the one on the right is the one who gets grapes the one who gets cucumber note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine the first piece she eats then she sees the other one getting grape and you will see what happens and she gets a grape and eats it the other one sees that she gives a rock to us now gets again cucumber tests a rock now and she gets cucumber again laughter so this is basically the wall street protest that you see here economists philosophers they didn 't like this at all because they had decided in their minds i believe that and so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the french revolution laughter and another one wrote a whole chapter saying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness if the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes now the funny thing the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape and i think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for a while i believe there 's an evolved morality i think morality is much more than what i 've been talking about but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates which are reciprocity and a sense of fairness and so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up so to speak without necessarily god and religion involved and i thank you for your attention"
