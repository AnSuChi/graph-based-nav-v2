  "transcript": "hundred and one a woman called auguste was taken to a medical asylum in frankfurt auguste was delusional and couldn 't remember even the most basic details of her life her doctor was called alois alois didn 't know how to help auguste but he watched over her until sadly she passed away in one thousand nine hundred and six after she died alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in auguste 's brain the likes of which he 'd never seen before if auguste had instead been alive today we could offer her no more help than alois was able to one hundred and fourteen years ago alois was dr alois alzheimer and auguste deter antiretrovirals for hiv statins for heart but so i think about this all the time alzheimer 's now affects forty it will affect one hundred and fifty million people which by the way will include many of you your chance of getting alzheimer 's will be almost one in two 'll spend your golden years either suffering from alzheimer 's or already in the united states alone alzheimer 's care costs two hundred billion dollars every year one out of every five medicare dollars get spent on alzheimer 's it is today the most expensive disease and costs are projected to increase fivefold by two thousand and fifty as the baby boomer generation ages it may surprise you alzheimer 's is the only one we cannot prevent cure or even slow down we understand less about the science of alzheimer 's than other diseases because we 've invested less time and money into researching it the us government spends ten times more every year on cancer research than on alzheimer 's despite the fact that alzheimer 's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer the lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause a lack of awareness because here 's what few people know but everyone should alzheimer 's is a disease and we can cure it for most of the past one hundred and fourteen years everyone including scientists but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an alzheimer 's patient as well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities the damage to the brain caused by alzheimer 's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal remember for almost a century we didn 't know much about these today we know they 're made from protein molecules there are spots on the paper that are sticky and some sticky bits are on the outside this causes the protein molecules to stick to each other forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles that 's what we see in the brains of alzheimer 's patients there are many steps and identifying which step to try to block is complex cutting others might make the bomb explore we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best but now we 've got together a diverse group of people and together we 've managed to identify a critical step in the process so these and you can see they 're moving around normally these worms on the other hand have protein molecules sticking together inside them but if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage then we see and they live a normal lifespan there 's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next ten or twenty years we need help we need you to raise awareness that alzheimer 's is a disease and that if we try we can beat it in the case of other diseases patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments the pharmaceutical industry scientists and regulators that was essential for advancing treatment for hiv in the late so it really is down to you everyone with a brain is at risk"
