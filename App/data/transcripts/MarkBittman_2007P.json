  "transcript": "but i 'm here to talk about something that 's become very important to me in the last year or two it is about food but it 's not about i 'm not a vegetarian this is the old nixon line right but i still think that this because only once before has the fate of individual people there was the bomb and there 's now and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives but whether if we could see the earth a century from now we 'd recognize it it 's a holocaust of a different kind and hiding under our desks isn 't going to help start with the notion that global warming is not only real but dangerous every scientist in the world now believes this and even president bush has seen the light or pretends to we can take this is a given after energy production atmosphere altering gases nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production more than transportation you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts but methane is twenty times more poisonous than co2 and it 's not just methane water shortages and loss of biodiversity there 's more but lists like this become kind of numbing so let me just say this you should probably be a now i 'm no more than i am anti atom there 's no question some cancers are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world and that 's the direct result of eating a western diet our demand for meat dairy and refined carbohydrates the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of coke a day our demand for these things not our need our want now global warming was unforeseen we didn 't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility maybe a few lung diseases here and there but you know the current health crisis however is a little more the healthier we 'd be no but the evidence is that plants and i want to make this clear it 's not the ingredients in plants the plants it 's not the it 's the carrot the evidence is very clear you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad what do they have in common we don 't need animal products and we certainly don 't need white bread or coke three their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more let 's imagine a parallel let 's pretend that our government supported an while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy knowing all the while that the result would be pollution war and rising costs either they 're outvoted by puppets of they encouraged us via their overly simplistic food pyramid along with more carbs what they didn 't tell us is that some carbs are better than others and that plants and whole grains but industry lobbyists would never let that happen and guess what so instead of substituting plants for animals our swollen appetites simply became larger and the most dangerous aspects of them remained but with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local i like animals and i don 't think it 's just fine to industrialize their production but there 's no way to treat animals well when you 're killing ten billion of them a year that 's our number ten billion if you strung all of them chickens cows pigs and lambs to the moon they 'd go there and back five times there and back now my math 's a little shaky but this is this is pretty good and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long but you get the idea and with our kindness might just be a bit of a red herring let 's get the numbers of the animals we 're killing for eating down and then we 'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left another red herring might be exemplified by the word locavore which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary seriously between the official story the food pyramid and the hip locavore vision you have two versions of how to improve our eating they both get it wrong though and i 'm going to go through that at least the last hundred years or so very quickly right now a hundred years ago guess what everyone was a locavore and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion every family had a cook usually a mom and those moms bought and prepared food it was like your there were no restaurant there were neighborhood restaurants run by local people but none of them would think to open another one eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic and fancy food was entirely french as an aside those of you who remember dan aykroyd in doing julia child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide before even julia back in those days there was no philosophy you just ate you didn 't claim to be anything you ate because it was an ingredient the goldfish swam and again everyone ate local in new york an orange was a common christmas present because it came all the way from florida from the ' 30s on road systems expanded trucks took the and the death of family farms is part of this puzzle as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato even in summer eventually california produced too much food to ship fresh so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods it was sold to proto feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework now i know everybody over the age of like forty five their mouths are watering at this point if we had a slide of salisbury steak even more so many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad i for one and i 'm not kidding didn 't eat real spinach or broccoli till i was nineteen who needed it though meat was everywhere what could be easier more filling or healthier they were forced to eat soy and corn they have trouble digesting those grains of course but that wasn 't a problem for producers new drugs kept they kept them alive healthy was another story thanks to farm subsidies the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress soy corn and cattle became king and chicken soon joined them on the throne listen to fifty and two thousand the world 's population doubled meat consumption increased five fold there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts because all of them could be bought at any store not that they were any good but they were there minute rice my mom is not here so i can say this now this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself it wasn 't all bad by the some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook industrial perhaps because it was being produced rationally as if it were plastic food gained magical or poisonous powers or both many people became fat phobic others worshiped broccoli as if it were god like instead they were sold on yogurt yogurt being almost as good as broccoli except in reality the way the industry sold yogurt was to sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many soy corn products as could be crammed into it think and then it 's fried in corn oil all you do is nuke it what could be better and zapped horribly home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home and cooking simply wasn 't important enough for men to share the burden you 've got your pizza nights you 've got your microwave nights you 've got your grazing nights you 've got your fend for yourself nights and so on cheese the very stuff that will kill you but organic food isn 't the answer either at least not the way it 's currently defined when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself is supposedly organic and the fish themselves and if that salmon 's from chile and it 's killed down there and then flown whatever dumping and then being trucked a few hundred the locavores the organivores the vegetarians the vegans the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food even though we 've come to this from different points we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food and this is not only an issue of social justice as ann cooper said and of course she 's completely right but it 's also one of global survival which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food as i said eighteen percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production how much livestock do you need to produce this seventy percent of the agricultural land on earth thirty percent of the earth 's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we 'll eat and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like there is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life the most common argument is that we need nutrients even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week what do you think we eat per but don 't we need meat to be big and strong isn 't meat eating essential to health won 't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless sissy liberals some of us might think that would be a good thing but no even if we were all steroid filled football players the answer is no in fact we don 't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition and it 's killing us but it 's a start it would seem absurd but that 's exactly what should happen along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants i 've been writing about food more or less omnivorously one might say indiscriminately for about thirty years during that time i 've eaten and recommended eating just about everything but i do think that for the benefit of everyone the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly"
