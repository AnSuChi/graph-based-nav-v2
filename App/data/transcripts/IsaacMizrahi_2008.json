  "transcript": "you know but for years i 've been sitting up i walk aimlessly sometimes i used to walk more at night i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting and sometimes actually once it was on page six in the post that i was cruising this guy like sort of whatever but i was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on and so i was following this guy as a matter of fact i think a lot of my design there are so many images out there so many clothes out there and the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken of course or very very surprising and often i 'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt or something that looks and so i 'd make the car stop and i 'd get out of the car and walk and see that that in fact there wasn 't a hole i don 't know where inspiration comes from it does not come i don 't get necessarily inspired by of fact one of the most fun things i 've ever ever done in my whole life was this christmas season at the guggenheim in new york i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band from juilliard and i did like you know the narrator and i read it talking about stalinism and talking about and a bird and you know he ate the bird and then in the end you hear you know you hear the bird squeaking or something you know if i 'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th century opera or something like that because it 's interesting not because it 's what i 'm supposed to do i 'm very very very inspired by movies color of movies and the way light makes the colors light from behind the projection or light from the projection makes the colors look so impossible and anyway roll this little clip i 'll just show you i their roles and about how you have to like what your daughters look at ironically glorified i go back to color all the time color is something that motivates me a lot it 's rarely color that i find in nature juxtaposed next to artificial color natural color is but for the most part i think you know i want to show you i 'm also like a big i and that 's another thing that motivates me a lot people say that an astrologer tells me to do something so i do it when i was about for years i would go to bars and sort of anyone i met whose name was eric i was humping immediately or something i want to show you this clip because i do this kind of crazy the name of the show is and this has to do with being happy i swear i was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year and we were getting serious so we decided to invite them all to dinner our parents and we you know sort of introduced them to each other my mother was sort of so my mother was a little offended she turned to her and she said are you kidding they have the greatest life together they eat out they see shows they see shows that 's the name of the show they eat out they that 's on my tombstone when i die he ate out he saw shows right in editing these clips i didn 't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at joe 's pub so you 'll have to like go check it out and come see me or something because it 's mortifying and yet it feels and you know in my case because if i just do one thing all the time because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything and not just one one you know you don 't master feeling lousy about one thing yeah exactly and i designed three operas with him and the most recent one very ingrained in the dance world since i was a teenager i went to performing arts high school where i was an actor and many of my friends were ballet dancers again i don 't know where maybe that 's where the whole inspiration thing started from puppets and then there i was in high school meeting dancers and acting and somehow from there i got interested in design i went to parsons school of design i don 't really think of myself as a designer i don 't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer and frankly i don 't really know what to call myself i think of myself know what i think of myself as it 's just that you always have to be slightly bored with everything and if you 're not you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything but i i am really a little bored with everything i always say to my partner marisa gardini who books everything she books everything and she makes everything happen and she makes all the deals and i always tell her that i find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program which is you know like that 's so so somehow like about ten years ago i thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a t v studio like for a day show some kind of day talk show because it 's all of these and so i had this t v show and that was a very very very big part of my process actually could you roll the clip please this is one of my favorite clips of rosie a cutting hair never never i don 't think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous im you look so cute already by the way rod you you know what i mean and because just just because if you 're fabulously rich and fabulously famous does that mean you shouldn 't have kids because you know they 're going to end up getting messed up rod no but it means that your priority has to be their but you have to make the decision for yourself my kids are seven who the hell knows they 're going to be like fourteen and in rehab and they 're going to be playing this clip i mean like making someone who 's already cute look terrible like that that is not boring that is nothing if it 's not boring actually i read this great quote the other day which was makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you 're going to die right and then i realized that was on my website and then it said like you know the quote was attributed to me and i thought oh i said something you know in an interview i forgot that i said that but it 's really true i want to show you this last clip because it 's going to be my last i always relate things to kitchen ry and so it 's got a lot of different things on it it 's a polymathematical website we actually shoot segments like t v show segments and it 's kind of my favorite thing in the world and it just began like in the beginning of february so who knows and again i don 't say it 's good i just think it 's not boring stop laughing it 's not funny just because i don 't know that whole that there 's no such thing as whole buttermilk sorry what chef well here 's the deal is cream and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water the liquid is actually that clear liquid if you 've ever overbeaten your whipped cream it 's actually buttermilk and that 's what people used for baking and all sorts of things now the the reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious"
