  "transcript": "family school or anything else i feel that way i try my best but some time ago whether it was being a husband or a friend i 've since realized from conversations i 've had and from research that this stagnation despite hard work turns out to be like to share with you some insights into why that is and what we can all do about it what i 've learned is that the most effective people and teams in any domain do something we can all emulate they go through life deliberately alternating between two zones then we do activities designed for knowing that we will learn from them that is very different from what we do when we 're in our performance zone which is when our goal is to do something as best as we can to execute both of these zones should be part of our lives but being clear about when we want to be in each of them with what goal focus and expectations this hinders our growth and ironically over the long term also our performance so what does the learning zone look like take demosthenes a political leader and the greatest orator and lawyer in ancient greece but instead he did activities designed for improvement so he also studied great speeches and acting it would hurt projecting his voice above the roar of the waves his activities in the learning zone were very different from his activities in court his because activities designed for improvement are domain specific and great teachers and coaches know what those activities are and can also give us expert feedback it is this type of practice in the learning zone which leads to substantial improvement not just time on task performing research shows that after the first couple of years working in a profession performance usually plateaus the best salespeople at least once a week do activities with the goal of improvement they read but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them each of us has probably spent many many many hours typing on a computer without but if we spent ten to twenty minutes each day fully concentrating on typing ten to twenty percent faster than our current reliable speed we would get faster especially if we also identified what mistakes we 're making and practiced typing those words it very much does when i needed a knee surgery i didn 't tell the surgeon poke around in there and focus on what you don 't know we 'll learn from your mistakes i looked for a surgeon who i being in the performance zone allows us to get things done as best as we can then applying those skills in the performance zone she identifies opportunities for improvement for herself her dancers and her camera staff and the next morning everyone receives pages of notes with what to adjust which they then work on during the what we call a growth mindset then the consequence of making them must not be catastrophic or even very and an athlete wouldn 't set out to first try a new move during a championship match we create social social risks for one another even in schools which are supposed to be all about learning and i 'm not talking about standardized tests but they learn that mistakes are undesirable inadvertently when teachers or parents are eager to hear just correct answers and reject mistakes rather than welcome and examine them to learn from them or when we look for narrow responses rather than encourage more exploratory thinking that we can all learn from the same is true in and they fall behind we can create more spaces for growth by starting conversations with one another about when we want to be in each zone what do we want to get better at and how and when do we want to execute and minimize mistakes then here are three things that we can still do as individuals first we can create low stakes islands in an otherwise these are spaces where mistakes have little consequence we might find a mentor or a trusted colleague with whom we can exchange ideas or have vulnerable conversations or even role play feedback oriented meetings as projects progress but then reflect on what we could do better next time like we can lead so that others can feel safe to do the same real confidence is about modeling ongoing learning what if instead of spending our lives doing doing doing what if we created more low stakes islands and waters and what if we got clear within ourselves and with our teammates so that our efforts can become more consequential our improvement never ending and our best even better"
