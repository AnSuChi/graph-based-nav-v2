  "transcript": "i got an email from a man in israel who had read one of my books but i 'm your 12th cousin and it said i have a family tree with eighty thousand people on it including you marx and several european aristocrats now i did not know what to make of this part of me was like okay when 's he going to ask me to wire ten thousand dollars to his nigerian bank right i also thought eighty thousand relatives do i want that i have enough trouble with and i won 't name names but you know who you are here i am alone in my office but i 'm not alone at all i 'm connected to eighty thousand people around the world and that 's four madison square gardens full of cousins but they 're all related to me so this email inspired me to dive into genealogy but it turns out it 's going through a fascinating revolution and a controversial one it 's because of the internet there are sites that now take the wikipedia approach to family trees collaboration and crowdsourcing and what you do is you load your family tree on and then these sites search to see if the a j jacobs in your tree is the same as the a j jacobs in another tree and if it is then you can combine and then you combine and combine and combine until you get these massive mega family trees with thousands of people on them or even millions i which has no less than a you are on it whether you know it or not and you can see the links she has no idea i exist but and there 's my cousin barack obama he is my aunt 's fifth great aunt 's husband 's father 's wife 's seventh great nephew so and my cousin of course the actor kevin bacon plus or minus several degrees now i 'm not boasting because all of you have famous people and historical figures in in your tree because we are all connected and seventy five million may seem like a lot but in a few years it 's quite likely we will have a family tree with all almost all seven and i do think it is important and i 'll give you five reasons why really quickly first it 's got scientific value and it 's giving us valuable data about how diseases are inherited how people migrate and there 's a team of scientists mit right now studying the world family tree so i told my seven year old son that and he was totally engaged now albert einstein is not some dead white guy with weird hair he 's uncle albert and my son wanted to know but i will say that 's on my wife 's side so sorry honey number three interconnectedness we all come from the same ancestor and you don 't have to believe the literal bible version scientists talk about y chromosomal adam and and these were about one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand years ago we all have a bit of their dna in us they are our and so that means we literally all are biological cousins as the farthest cousin you have on earth is about a descendants number four a i know that i think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots because they 're going to have to realize that they are cousins with thousands of people in whatever ethnic group they happen to to have issues with and i think you look back at history and a lot of the terrible things we 've done to each other is because one group thinks another group is sub human and you can 't do that anymore we 're not just part of the same species we 're part of the same family we share ninety nine point nine percent of our dna now the final one is number five a democratizing effect some genealogy has an elitist strain like people say i 'm descended from mary queen of scots and you 're not so you cannot join my country club but that 's really going to be hard to do now because everyone is related i 'm descended from mary queen of scots so it 's really a fascinating time in the history of family because it 's changing so fast there is gay marriage and sperm donors and there 's intermarriage on an unprecedented scale and this makes some of my more conservative cousins a little nervous i think the more inclusive the idea of family is the better and as my aunt 's eighth cousin twice removed hillary clinton and that 's when i decided and you 're all invited next year next summer i will be hosting what i hope is the biggest and best family reunion in history which is i think paul mccartney is eleven steps away so i 'm hoping he brings his guitar and there is going to be a day of speakers of fascinating cousins cass sunstein my cousin who is perhaps the most brilliant legal scholar will be he was a former member of the obama number forty one the father he has agreed to participate and nick kroll the comedian and dr oz and many more to come and i invite you to to including you guys so together i think we can figure it out only together can we solve these big problems so from cousin to cousin i thank you i can 't wait to see you"
