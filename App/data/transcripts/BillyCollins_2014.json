  "transcript": "i don 't know if you 've noticed but there 's been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs do they think do they feel and if so how so this afternoon in my limited time i wanted to take both of whom have taken the command speak quite literally the first dog is the first to go and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner and the title is a dog on his master i am growing older faster than he whatever the number i will pass him one day and take the lead the way i do on our walks in the woods and if this ever manages to cross his mind it would be the sweetest shadow i have ever cast on snow or grass thank you and our next dog speaks in something called the revenant which means a spirit that comes back i am the dog you put to sleep as you like to call the needle of oblivion i never liked you when i watched you toweling yourself i wanted to leap and unman you with a snap i resented the way you moved your lack of animal grace the way you would sit in a chair to eat a napkin on your lap a knife in your hand i would have run away but i was too weak a trick you taught me while i was learning to sit and heel shake hands without a hand i admit the sight of the leash would excite me but only because it meant i was about to smell things you had never touched disliked your friends and worse your relatives the jingling of my tags drove me mad you always scratched me in the wrong place all i ever wanted from you was food and water in my bowls it took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl i am free of the collar monogrammed sweater the absurdity of your lawn except what you already supposed and are glad it did not happen sooner that everyone here can read and write the dogs in poetry the cats and all the others in prose"
