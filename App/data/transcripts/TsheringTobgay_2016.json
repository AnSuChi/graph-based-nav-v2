  "transcript": "and no i 'm not saying what i 'm wearing underneath this is a gho this is my national dress this is how all men dress in bhutan we men get to wear we get to show off our legs our national dress is unique but this is not the only thing that 's unique about my bhutan is a small country in the himalayas but let me tell you right off the bat we are not shangri la my country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks the reality is that there are barely seven hundred thousand of us sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth we are thriving and the reason we are thriving is because we 've been blessed our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly to develop our country balancing economic growth carefully with social development environmental sustainability and cultural preservation gross national happiness is more important than gross national product ever since a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness but that 's easier said than done i know that some of you here are worth more individually but here is where it gets interesting education is completely free medical consultation medical treatment medicines they are all provided by the state we manage this because we use our limited resources very carefully and which is development with values but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture we celebrate our national dress too this is why i can wear my gho a fun fact you 're looking at the world 's biggest pocket goes around the back and comes out from inside here in this pocket we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets our constitution demands that a minimum of sixty percent of bhutan 's total land shall remain under forest cover for all time our constitution imposes forest cover on us our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us you see we the people didn 't want democracy we didn 't ask for it we didn 't our king imposed democracy on us by insisting that he include it in the constitution but he went further he included provisions in the constitution that empower the people to and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire at the age of sixty five fact is we already have a king in retirement our previous king the great fourth retired ten years ago at the peak of his popularity he was all of fifty one years so as i was saying seventy two percent of our country is under forest cover and all that forest is pristine and that 's why we are a carbon neutral country in a world that is threatened with turns out it 's a big deal of the 200 odd countries in the world today it looks like we are the only one actually that 's not quite accurate bhutan is not carbon is carbon negative our entire country generates two point two million tons of carbon dioxide but our forests they sequester more than three times that amount but that 's not all we export most of the the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood by two thousand and twenty we 'll be exporting enough electricity to offset seventeen million tons of carbon dioxide and if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential and that 's exactly what we are working at that is more co2 than what the entire city of new york we are offsetting carbon and this is important stuff you see the world is getting warmer and climate change is a reality which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction i was at that lake recently and that 's how it looked it was a solid glacier a few years ago a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below that destruction was caused by one glacier lake we have two thousand seven hundred of them to contend with the point is this my country and my people have done nothing but we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences that 's why we have promised we first made this promise in two thousand and nine during cop fifteen in copenhagen that when a small country raised our hands and announced we promise to remain carbon neutral for all time nobody heard us last december in paris at cop we reiterated our promise to remain carbon neutral for all time to come what was different in paris was that governments came round together and were willing to come together and act together and work together the un framework convention on climate change says that we 'd be closer to containing global warming by two degrees celsius i 've requested the ted organizers here to turn up the heat in here by two degrees it 's crucial that all of us keep our commitments as far as bhutan is concerned we will keep our promise the idea is that with free electricity they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food we are investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles we are subsidizing the cost of led lights and our entire government we are cleaning up our entire country through clean bhutan another national program but it is our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy our protected areas are our carbon sink they are our lungs but the beauty is that we 've connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors take this tiger for example it was spotted at two hundred and fifty meters above sea level in the hot subtropical jungles two years later that same tiger was spotted near four thousand meters in our cold alpine isn 't that awesome we must keep it that way so every year we set aside resources to prevent poaching hunting mining and pollution in our but that is expensive over the next few years our small economy won 't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect in fact when we run the numbers it looks like it 'll take us at least fifteen years before we can nor the world can afford to spend fifteen years going backwards this is why his majesty the king started bhutan for life bhutan for life gives us the time we need it is essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks to protect our parks the idea is to raise a transition fund but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met this means that individual donors can commit it 's something like a kickstarter project only with a 15 year time horizon and millions once the deal is closed we use the transition fund giving our government time to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the naturally i 'm pretty excited the world wildlife fund is our principle partner and i want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work they are doing in bhutan and across the it is getting warm in here i thank you for listening to our story a story of how we are keeping a story of so in like to share one more dream that i have what if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources our influence and our passion to replicate the bhutan for life idea to other countries so that they too after all there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face they too have natural resources that can help win the world 's fight for sustainability so what if we set up earth for life i invite you to help me to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those after all to dream together because the reality is we are thank you very much"
