  "transcript": "so i 'm a trained in architecture and and i want to talk to you today not about design but about america and how america can be but i think i need to talk about america because there is a history in some places not all of american ideas being appropriated being it 's being emulated in many places as we speak by suburban sprawl i refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a prosthetic device that many of us need just to most americans in fact need just to live their daily lives and there 's an alternative you know we say half the world is living in cities well in america that living in cities for many of them they 're living in cities still where they 're dependent on that automobile and what i work for and to do is to make our cities more walkable but i can 't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that i 've learned from the economists the epidemiologists and the environmentalists so these are the three arguments that i 'm going to give you when i was growing up in the ' 70s the typical american spent one tenth of their income american family on since then we 've doubled the number of roads in america and we now spend one fifth of our income because of this phenomenon called drive till you qualify so that they 're locked in this and these are the neighborhoods for example in the central valley of california that weren 't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up they were imagine and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you 're doing so we know what it 's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars what happens when a city decides it 's going to set other priorities and probably the best example we have here in america is portland oregon portland made a bunch of decisions while most other cities were growing they instituted a skinny streets program they actually and they spent sixty million dollars on bike facilities which seems like a lot of money but it was spent over about thirty years so two million dollars a year not that much and half the price of the one cloverleaf these changes and others like them traveled per day the amount that each person drives actually peaked in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six the typical portland citizen drives the economist joe cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those eleven minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all well portland is reputed to have the most the most these are all exaggerations slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth which is portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of america actually oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states which may be a good thing or a bad thing but it makes you glad they 're driving less but actually they 're spending most of it in their homes and home home investment is about as local an investment as you can get which is that young educated people they had a 50 percent increase which is five times what you saw anywhere else so on the one hand a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable so the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a but to become a place where people want to be and millennials back in the ' 70s one in ten americans was obese now one out of three americans and a second third of the population is overweight according to the center for disease control fully one third of all children born after two thousand will get diabetes we have the first generation of children in america who are predicted to live shorter lives parents i believe that this american healthcare crisis that we 've all heard about because we 've talked a long time about diet but we 've only started talking about inactivity and how inactivity born of our landscape inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk and we finally have the studies one in britain called gluttony versus sloth that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity and found a much higher stronger correlation between the latter two and then started pumping the calories in some people gained weight some people didn 't gain weight expecting some metabolic or dna factor at work than those who didn 't but even more we now have studies that tie weight to where you live do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city or where in your city do you live in san diego they used walk score walk score rates every address in america and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is they used walk score to designate more walkable neighborhoods so we have study after study now particularly as in america the biggest health crisis we have is this one that 's they call these neighborhoods i may have that wrong but you get the idea briefly mentioning we have an asthma epidemic in this country you probably haven 't thought that much about it fourteen americans die each day from asthma three times what it was in the ' your urban vmt and then finally in terms of driving twelve people out of every one hundred thousand die every year from car crashes we 're pretty safe here well guess what in england it 's seven per one hundred thousand it 's japan it 's four per one hundred thousand do you know where it 's three per one hundred thousand san francisco the same thing portland the same thing oh so cities make us safer because we 're driving less twenty per one hundred thousand it 's not whether you 're in the city or not it 's how is your city designed was it designed it 's really good at smashing them into each other that 's part of a much larger health argument finally the environmental argument is fascinating because the environmentalists turned on a dime about ten years ago the environmental movement in america has historically been an anti city movement from jefferson on cities are pestilential to the health to the liberties to the morals of man if we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities as they do in europe we shall become as corrupt as they are in europe and take to eating one another as they do he apparently had a sense of humor and then the american environmental movement has been a classically arcadian movement to become more environmental we move into the country we commune with nature we build but of course we 've seen what that does the carbon mapping of america where is the co2 being emitted for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly peaceful until some economists said you know is that the right way to measure co2 there are only so many people in this country at any given time and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact and they said let 's measure and red hot in these exurban drive till you qualify if you love nature the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it move to and the denser the better and the denser cities like manhattan are the cities that perform the best so the average manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn 't seen since the since the ' 20s consuming half of the electricity so obviously we can do better and we want to do better and we 're all trying to be green and i 'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets on accessorizing what can i add to my house what can i add to what i 've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable has kind of dominated the discussion so i 'm not immune to this my wife and i built a new house on an abandoned lot in washington d c we 've got the solar photovoltaic system solar hot water heater dual flush toilets bamboo floors a log burning in my yet all of these innovations that 's that 's what they said in the brochure all of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city and we don 't want to have this argument politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a lifestyle choice you don 't want to tell americans god forbid that they have to change their lifestyle but what if lifestyle was was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more something that would be better than what we have right now well the gold standard of quality of life rankings it 's called the mercer survey you may have heard of it they rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to ten criteria that they believe add up to quality of life education housing you name it there 's six more short talk and it 's very interesting to see that the highest ranking american city honolulu number twenty eight the dallases and the phoenixes and sorry atlanta these cities are not appearing the canadian cities like vancouver and you see this alignment this strange alignment is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life i would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life and that 's living so sustainability which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function we are polluting so much then these two problems would seem to share the which is to make our cities more walkable and it 's being done now in more than a few cities around the globe and in our country i take some solace from winston churchill who put it this way the americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives"
