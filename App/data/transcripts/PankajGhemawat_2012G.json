  "transcript": "i 'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are how globalized we aren 't and why it 's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of or surveys that i 've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the world trade organization is this view that national borders really don 't matter very much anymore cross border integration is close to complete and we live in one world and what 's interesting about this view is again it 's a view that 's held by but it 's also held by who see this giant globalization tsunami that 's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn 't already done so so i 've spent some time going back trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing and the best earliest quote that i could find was one from david livingstone writing in the about how the and the telegraph were integrating east africa perfectly david livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time so the best way i 've found may not even be close to flat so one of the things i 've been doing over the last few years and i 've looked at the as a percentage of the total i 'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow so let 's start in the world last year what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross border phone calls pick a percentage in your own mind the if you include internet telephony you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent or let 's turn to people moving across borders one particular thing we might look at in terms of long term flows of people is what percentage of the world 's population is accounted for by or think of investment take all the real investment that went on in the world in two thousand and ten what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment the one statistic that i suspect many of the people in this room have seen the there 's a big problem with the official statistics in that if for instance a japanese component supplier ships something to china to be put into an ipod and then the ipod gets shipped to the u s that component ends up getting counted multiple times without the rather than the thirty percent plus numbers that we 're talking about so it 's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book point zero that we 're very very far from the which would imply internationalization levels of the order of who are prone to this kind of overstatement i 've also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guess these numbers to be let me share with you the results of a survey that harvard business review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people 's guesses along these dimensions actually were first of all there is a suggestion of some error okay second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than ten percent and third this is not just confined to the readers of the harvard business review i 've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated ratio people have this tendency towards overestimation especially because i i suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims i think it 's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney a when i first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy one of the people who wrote and since my article was titled why the world isn 't flat that wasn 't too surprising which was ghemawat 's data are narrow and this caused me to scratch my head because as i went back through his so my point is i haven 't presented a lot of data here to convince you that i 'm right but i would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of and the interviewer 's first question to me was professor ghemawat why do you still believe that the world is round because i hadn 't come across that formulation before laughter and as i was laughing i was thinking i really need a more coherent response especially on national tv i 'd better write something about but what i can 't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief he really has no idea as to what 's actually going on in the world so try this out with your friends and acquaintances if you like and then the final reason which i mention especially to a ted audience with some trepidation has to if you listen to techno music for long periods of time it does things to your brainwave activity something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all political but when i get to this point in my lecture with my students hands go up but what about facebook because in some sense it 's the ideal kind of technology to think about theoretically it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door what percentage of people 's friends the answer is probably form friendships at random on facebook so does all this matter or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to i want to suggest that actually globaloney can be very harmful to your health first of all recognizing that the glass is only ten to twenty percent full is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional whereas if we thought we were already there there would be no particular point to pushing harder it 's a little bit like we wouldn 't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we room for something more something that would contribute further to global welfare which brings me to my second point avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization so i actually spend most of my three point zero book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what i have think of france and the current debate about immigration that 's their guess maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue or to take an even which is slightly in excess of the actual level thing about this particular survey was when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data so foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up if you think about it what i 've been talking about today is this notion very uncontroversial amongst economists that most things are very foreign aid is the most aid to poor people is about the most home biased thing you can find if you look at the oecd countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person and compare it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries now of course some of us if we truly are cosmopolitan would like to see that ratio being brought down like to make the suggestion that we don 't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are if we simply brought that ratio down to fifteen thousand to one we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the rio summit twenty years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on"
