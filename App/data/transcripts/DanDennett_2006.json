  "transcript": "it 's wonderful to be back i love this wonderful gathering and you must be wondering what on earth have they put up the wrong slide this is ted this is technology entertainment design and there 's a dairy cow it 's a and i was thinking how do i introduce this and i thought well maybe you know poems are made by fools like me and and then it became domesticated thousands of years ago and human beings became its stewards and without even knowing what they were doing they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it and then more recently because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions they have evolved over they have a biological just like the aurochs because what i 've been doing for the last four years really since the first time you saw me some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion and in the in the last four years i 've been working and you might say it 's about the reverse engineering now that very idea i think strikes terror in many people or anger or and that is the spell that i want to break i want to say no religions are an important natural we should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena like global warming as we heard so eloquently last night from al gore today 's religions are brilliantly designed brilliantly designed they are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering there 's a mixture of evolutionary design designed by natural selection itself and intelligent design more or less intelligent design and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions i 'm going to have just one slide about my book because there is one message in it which i think this group really needs to hear and i would be very interested to get your responses to this it 's the one policy proposal that i make in the book at this time when i claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make and it 's one that echoes here 's my proposal i 'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it education on world religions for all of our children in primary school in high school in public schools in private schools and in home schooling so what i 'm proposing is just as we require american history so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world about their history and this should be with no particular spin to all of the children in the country and as long as you teach them that you can teach them anything else you like that i think is maximal tolerance for religious freedom as long as you inform your children about other religions then you may and as early as you like and whatever you like teach them why do i say that because democracy depends on an informed citizenship informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy consent this is the way we treat people children below the age of consent are a special i 'm going to use a word that pastor rick just used parents are stewards of their children they don 't own them you can 't own your children you have a responsibility to the world to the state to them to take care of them right you may teach them whatever creed you think is most important but i say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world too the reason i 've taken this time is i 've been one reviewer for a roman catholic newspaper it strikes me as i don 't think so all i 'm saying is and facts facts only no values just facts about all the world 's religions another reviewer called it i 'm really bothered by the fact it seems to me to be such a plausible natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that i 'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous i know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their among their children that they are intent this picture which i pulled off the web that 's the steward cows couldn 't live without human stewards they 're domesticated they 're a sort of and pastor rick was talking about sheep i 'm going to talk about sheep too there 's a lot of serendipitous convergence here how clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds protection from predators food finding health maintenance the only cost in most flocks not even this a loss of free mating what a deal but it was a very clever move whose clever move was it it was the clever move of natural selection itself francis crick the leslie orgel a molecular biologist brilliant guy and orgel 's second rule is evolution is cleverer than you are intelligent design then you understand why the intelligent design movement is basically a hoax the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are unbelievably brilliant again and again biologists and why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to they 're not really bright they don 't have to be the lesson we learn from this is you don 't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary the design is there in nature but it 's not in anybody 's head question was domestication good for sheep it was great for their genetic fitness and here i want to remind you of a wonderful here 's what he said ten thousand years ago at the dawn of agriculture human yesterday in biological terms what is it today does anybody remember what he told us percent that is what we have done on this planet now i talked to paul afterwards i wanted to check to find out how he 'd calculated get the sources and so forth and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this and there was a passage in it which he did not present here and i think it is so good i 'm going to read it to you over billions of years on a unique sphere complex improbable wonderful and fragile suddenly we humans a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush we heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet and how can we do that the key to our domination of the planet is culture and the key to culture is religion suppose martian they would be puzzled by many things anybody know what this is i 'll tell you what it is perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever as seen from satellite photograph here 's a big crowd here 's another crowd in would be amazed by this they 'd want to know how it originated what it was for and how it perpetuates itself actually i 'm going to pass over this this the ant isn 't alone there 's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which in that case a parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat and it turns the mouse into mighty mouse makes it fearless out in the open where it 'll be eaten by a cat true story in other words we have these hijackers you 've seen this slide before from four years ago yes it to the will of allah and on it it says in latin the word of god is the seed and the sower of the seed is christ same idea well not christians too glory in the fact that they have surrendered to god i 'll give you a few quotes the heart of worship is surrender surrendered people obey god 's words even if it doesn 't make sense those words those are from the purpose driven life and what i want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint because i think it 's actually a brilliant book first of all the goal and you heard just now what the goal is it 's to bring purpose to the lives of millions and he has succeeded is it a good goal in itself i 'm sure we all agree it is a wonderful goal he 's absolutely right there are lots of people out there who i give him an a + on this al gore eat your heart out just exactly what al is trying to do this is a fantastic achievement and the means how does he do it it 's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes updating them quietly dropping obsolete features this is the evolution of religion that 's been going on for thousands of years and he 's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it wise advice on every page moreover he invites us to look under the hood i really appreciated that for instance he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different bible verses vivid accessible beautifully formatted you make another copy in your brain thank you because i 'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that i said about this book i wish he could do this with a revision a mark two version of his book the truth will set you free that 's what it says in the bible and it 's something that i want to live by too my problem is and that 's not my main complaint that 's worth mentioning here 's a passage it 's very much what he said anyway if there was no god we would all be accidents the result of astronomical random chance in the universe you could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance there would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on earth now i just do not believe that by the way i find homer groening 's film there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong we don 't need a belief in god to be good or to have meaning in us but that as i said is just a difference of opinion that 's not what i 'm really worried about how about this god designed this planet 's environment just so we could live in it i 'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment and then i find this all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact and here i think wait a minute i read this again i read it three or four times and i think is he really endorsing intelligent design is he endorsing creationism here and you can 't tell so i 'm sort of thinking well i don 't know i don 't know if i want to get upset with this yet but then i read and i read this first noah had never seen rain because prior to the flood god irrigated the earth from the ground up and i think that thinking this way about the history of the planet after we 've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years discourages people from scientific understanding warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way here 's one god deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique he carefully mixed the dna cocktail that created you i think that 's false now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical here 's another one for instance your brain can store one hundred trillion facts your mind can handle fifteen thousand decisions a second well it would be interesting to find the interpretation where i would accept that there might be some way of of treating that as true anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge hardwired by god into the very fiber of our being an inbuilt need to connect with god you have to be an intelligent designer you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection and i think on the contrary that it is very important to solving the world 's problems whose truth are we going to listen to well this is from the the compass i rely on for direction the counsel i listen to for making wise decisions and the benchmark i use for evaluating and here 's one that does concern me remember i quoted him before with this line surrendered people obey god 's word even if it doesn 't make sense that 's a problem don 't ever argue with the devil he 's better at arguing than you are having had thousands of years to practice it 's a very clever adaptation of religions it 's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism that 's the devil speaking this discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have i 've got one more problem then i 'm through and i 'd really like to get a response if if rick is is able to do it baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit and teach them to do everything i 've told you ' the bible says jesus is the only one who can save the world we 've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so here 's one not as beautiful as the others it simply shows the religions of the world here 's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions do we really want to commit ourselves to when their holy books are telling them don 't listen to the other side that 's just satan talking it seems to me that that 's a very problematic ship to get on for the future i found this sign as i was driving to maine recently i don 't believe it popular as it is not in this guise but in general is itself one of the main problems that we face if you are who are being very good without god and you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works thanks very much"
