  "transcript": "but i do want to talk to you about something that i think is dear to all of us and that is bread something which is as simple and i think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form low carb diets so i 'm going to bake bread bear with me first of all a little bit of audience one is a supermarket standard white bread pre packaged which i 'm told is called a wonderbread and this okay let me do this differently is anybody preferring the wonderbread at all i have two tentative male hands this so and i think it 's about a traditional way of living a way that is perhaps more real more honest this is an image from tuscany where we feel agriculture is still why do we in the ten thousand years since agriculture evolved most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they and we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past art has helped us to maintain that kind of image it was a mythical past of course the reality is quite different these poor farmers working the land by hand or with their animals had yield levels but we have somehow in the course of the last few started to cultivate an image of a mythical rural agricultural past it it 's very important to understand what that revolution and it actually drove up our yields and even sort of horrible things like picking beans by hand can now be done automatically great improvement as we shall see of course we also particularly in the last decade and it means that you now eat products which can come from all around the world that is the reality of our modern life now you may prefer this loaf of bread excuse my hands but this is how it is but actually the is this white wonder loaf and don 't despise the white bread because it really i think symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become and that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much but it has changed the well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics with the advent of the industrial revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades since the and that is the result directly it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like on average in the high income countries five percent or less of of the population in the u s only one percent of the people are actually farmers and it frees us all up to do other things to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people and never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact we add in raisins and today bread now is associated with obesity which is very strange it is the basic most fundamental food that we 've had in the last ten thousand years wheat is the most important crop the first crop we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava so bread has become from a main staple and the whiter the bread in many countries the better it is so this is the story of bread as we know it now but of course the price of large scale and large scale has meant destruction of biodiversity still a lonely emu here in the brazilian cerrado soybean fields the costs have been tremendous water pollution all the things you know about destruction of our and this is where i have to query all of you how many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals how many of you actually can make a bread in this way without starting with a bread machine or just in fact not many of you know that our bread of course was not a european invention it was invented by farmers in iraq and syria in particular the put us on the road of bread now it is not surprising that with this massification and large scale production there is a counter movement that emerged very much also here in california let 's go back to this let 's go back to traditional farming let 's go back to small scale to farmers ' markets small bakeries good food and the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about if we do this if we want to stay with traditional small scale farming we are going actually to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands among whom i have lived for many years working without electricity and water to try to improve their food production we relegate them to poverty we cannot just think that it 's a luxury solution for us who can afford it if you want to afford it in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this if we say just small scale production as is the tendency here to go back to local food means that a poor man like hans rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in scandinavia we don 't have oranges so we must find other solutions one of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly doubling by about two thousand and thirty and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what so what can we do can we find a solution to produce more i feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land one hundred and fifty thousand times just to so what can we do we must feed three billion people in cities we will not do that through small farmers ' markets because these people have no small farmers ' markets at their disposal but yes and let me just do one simple conceptual thing if i plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale what you see is that we 've started in the left hand corner with traditional agriculture which was sort of large scale and very high control what i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale not just in terms of the scale of the fields but in terms of the entire food network that 's where we should move and the ultimate may be but it doesn 't apply to cereals that we have entirely closed ecosystems so we need to think differently about agriculture science agriculture science for most people and there are not many farmers among you here has this name of being bad of being about pollution about large scale about the destruction of the well first of all i think we can do much better on the existing technologies use biotechnology where where useful particularly in pest and disease resistance and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of we need to think that land is multi functional it has different functions there are different ways in which we and we also need to re examine livestock i want to have horticulture and greenhouses and i want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas using biological agriculture but we can do a lot more and the main thing that i would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries or as you stay here ask your government for an integrated food policy food is as important everything is linked so this is not science fiction we can combine things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people to house for example the chronically sick there is all kinds of things we can do talk to people in restaurants understand where you are in the food chain where your food and the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive in our own it 's about honesty it 's about identity who said this so beautifully was mahatma gandhi seventy five god can only appear as bread evolutionarily speaking is"
