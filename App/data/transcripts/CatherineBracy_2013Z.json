  "transcript": "'m going to talk about hackers and the image that comes to your mind when i say that word is probably not but i 'm going to explain to you why it should be the image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous mischievous or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity and mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of but like most in technology and the technology world hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil for every hacker that 's trying to steal your identity there 's one that 's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system and it a deeply democratic activity it 's about critical thinking it 's about questioning existing ways of doing things it 's the idea that if you see a problem you work to fix it and not just complain about it and in many ways hacking is what built betsy ross was a hacker the underground railroad was a brilliant hack and from the wright brothers to steve jobs hacking has always been at the foundation of american democracy so if there 's one thing i want to leave you here with today it 's that the next time you think about who a hacker is you think not of this guy because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available he brought us bifocals and the lightning rod and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of american democracy he was a tinkerer and a statesman and we call call those people like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise are the same values and so it 's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government but before i give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like i want to make clear that you don 't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker you just have to believe that you can bring a 21st century tool set to bear on the problems and we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at code for america that they didn 't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects so keep that in mind hackers so what does civic hacking look like and it 's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn 't going to be possible in the few months that they had so instead they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website they 're looking for answers to questions so our team built honolulu answers which is a super simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action now the site itself was easy enough to build but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content it would have taken the three of them a very long time especially given that none of them are actually from they apparently in one saturday afternoon they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions but more importantly than that they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government now i think this is a really cool story in and of itself but it gets more awesome on the national day of civic hacking this past june in oakland where i live the code for america team in oakland took the open source code base of honolulu answers and turned it into oakland answers and again we held a write a thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them and i got into the act i authored this answer and a few others and i 'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that i feel for the place that i live based simply on this small act of participation and by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we 're enabling through civic hacking we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government at this point you may be wondering what city officials think of all this they actually love it so when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities now i don 't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an american phenomenon it 's happening across the globe and one of my favorite examples is from mexico city where earlier this year the mexico house of representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators so this was just for the handful of legislators in the house and the contract was a two year contract for nine point three million dollars now a lot of people were really angry about this especially geeks who knew that nine point three million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app but instead of taking to they asked programmers in mexico to build something better and cheaper and they offered a prize of nine thousand three hundred dollars they submitted one hundred and and because of this action and now this has sparked a movement in mexico city which is home to one of our partners code and so what you see in all three of these places in honolulu and in oakland and in mexico city are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking 's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them and through that work they 're creating a 21st century ecosystem of participation they 're creating he founded and it 's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city so in true civic hacker fashion and we want to ask you to follow in ben franklin 's footsteps and come join us we have thirty one brigades in the u s we are pleased to announce today that we 're opening up starting with cities in poland and japan and ireland and if there 's not a brigade where you live we will help you we 've created a tool kit which also lives at we will support you along the way our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system and that will empower citizens so please come hack with us"
