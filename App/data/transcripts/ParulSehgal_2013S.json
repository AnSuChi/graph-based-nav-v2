  "transcript": "and she was so impressive as the new girl always seems to be she had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case on state capitals just a great speller and until i hatched my devious plan so one day i and i lurked in the girls ' bathroom when the coast was clear i emerged into the classroom and took from my teacher 's desk the grade book and then i did it i fiddled with my rival 's grades just a little just demoted some of those a 's all of those a 's and i got ready to return the book to the drawer when hang some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too i corrected everybody 's marks not imaginatively i gave everybody a row of d 's and i gave myself and i don 't understand why i felt so great doing it i felt i don 't understand why i was never caught i mean it should have been so blatantly obvious i was never caught but most of all i am baffled by why did it bother me so much that this little girl this tiny little girl was so good at spelling jealousy baffles me it 's so mysterious and it 's so pervasive we know primates do we know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the united states and yet i have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill for that we have to go to fiction because the novel is the lab that has i don 't know if it 's an exaggeration to say that if we didn 't have jealousy would we even have literature well no faithless helen no odyssey no jealous king no arabian nights no shakespeare no jealousy no proust and now i mean i know it 's fashionable to say that proust has the answers to everything but in the case of jealousy he kind of does does this year is the centennial of his masterpiece in search of and it 's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness my brand that we can hope to have and we think about proust we think about the sentimental bits right we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep we think about these are books that virginia woolf said were tough as cat gut i don 't know what cat gut but let 's assume it 's formidable the novel and jealousy jealousy and proust impediment is such a because let 's and these stories make us feel terrible because they 're designed to make us feel terrible as the teller of the tale and the audience we know just what details to include to dig that knife in jealousy makes us and this is something proust understood in the first volume swann 's way the series of books swann one of the main characters is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed and suddenly in the course of a few sentences and these are proustian sentences so they 're long as rivers but in the course of a few sentences he suddenly recoils and he realizes hang on everything i love about this woman somebody else would love about this woman everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure maybe right about now and this is the story he starts to tell himself and from then on proust writes that every fresh charm swann detects in his mistress he adds to his collection of instruments in his private torture chamber but jealousy is exhausting it 's a hungry emotion it must be fed jealousy jealousy likes photos that 's why instagram is such a hit proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy when swann is in his jealous throes and but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument he says they are scientific investigations with real intellectual value proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd humiliation loss these were the avenues to wisdom for proust he says elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us is he telling us to just go and find cruel women no i think he 's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves and does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity but he 's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing unintentional behaviors is she smiling too brightly here or did she accidentally brush up against a man there [ freud ] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his the novel is very good on this point the novel is very good the more intensely jealous we are and this is why i think jealousy doesn 't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive but i 'm also thinking of this story i heard on the news a 52 year old michigan woman was caught creating a fake facebook account from which she sent vile hideous messages to herself for a year and she was trying to frame her ex boyfriend 's new girlfriend and i have to confess when i heard this i just reacted with admiration laughter because i mean let 's be real what immense if misplaced creativity right this is something from a novel this is something from a patricia highsmith novel now highsmith is a particular favorite of mine she is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of american letters she 's the author of strangers on a train and the talented mr ripley books that are all about how jealousy it muddles our minds and once we 're in the sphere in that realm of jealousy the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant take tom ripley her most famous character now tom ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had and you 're under the floorboards he 's answering to your name he 's wearing your rings emptying your bank account that 's i can 't give the world d 's as much as i would i mean we 're all good citizens of social media aren 't we where the currency is envy i 'm not sure so let 's do what characters always do when they 're not sure when they are in possession of a mystery let 's go to when people think of holmes they think of but i 've always preferred and finally in the adventure of the six napoleons once holmes comes in dazzles everybody with his solution lestrade turns to holmes and he says we 're proud of you and he says that there 's not a man at scotland yard who wouldn 't want to shake sherlock holmes ' hand it 's one of the few times we see holmes moved in the mysteries and i find it very moving this little scene but it 's also mysterious right it seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry not emotion you know one minute holmes is on the other side from lestrade the next minute they 're on the same side suddenly lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he 's resented could it be so simple though what if jealousy really is a matter of geometry just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another well maybe then we wouldn 't have to resent somebody 's excellence we could align ourselves with it"
