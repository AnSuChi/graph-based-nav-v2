  "transcript": "for the last fifty years a lot of smart well resourced people some of you no doubt have been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty in the united states they 've created think tanks that study issues like education job creation and they 've written books and columns and given passionate speeches decrying the wealth gap that is leaving more and more people entrenched at the bottom end of the income scale i 'm here to tell you that we have overlooked the most powerful and practical resource here it people who are poor up in the left hand corner they met when they all had small children through a parenting class at a family resource center in san francisco they talked a lot about how hard it was to make money when your kids are little child care is expensive more than they they started a cleaning business they plastered neighborhoods with flyers and handed business cards out to their families and friends and soon they had clients calling two of them would clean the office or house and one but it made a difference for their families extra money to pay for bills when a husband 's work hours were cut money to buy the kids clothes as they were growing a little extra money in their pockets to make them feel some independence outgoing personality for example when rosie a little girl who spoke only spanish moved in next door borrowed her mother 's tablet and found a translation app so the two of them could communicate brianna started to struggle academically she was growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn and acting out in class and her mother was heartbroken over what was then they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade and brianna was devastated her mother felt hopeless and overwhelmed and alone because she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed and she did not know how to help her one afternoon theresa was catching up with a group of friends and one of them said theresa how are you and she burst into tears after she shared her story one of her friends said i went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago and in that moment theresa realized that so much of her struggle was not having anybody to talk with about it so she created a support group for parents like her the first meeting was her and two other people but word spread and soon twenty people thirty people were showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together she went from feeling helpless to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter with the support of other people who were going through the same struggle and brianna is doing fantastic she 's doing great academically and socially that in the middle is my man baakir standing in front of blackstar books and caffe which he runs out of part of his house as you walk in the door baakir greets you with a welcome black home perhaps a vegan walnut burger or jive turkey sammich and that 's sammich not sandwich which is several steps above a donut hole and made from a very secret family recipe for real it 's very secret he won 't tell you about it but blackstar is much more than a caf for the kids in the neighborhood it 's a place to go after school to get help with homework it 's a performance venue it 's a home for poets musicians and artists which impacts poor folks i have learned from families who are unleashing their ingenuity and tenacity to collectively create their own solutions and they 're not just focused on money everywhere i go i see people who are broke but not broken so that they can create a better life for themselves their i was raised by a quietly fierce single mother in rochester new york i was bussed to a school in the suburbs from a neighborhood that many of my classmates and their parents considered i 'd get myself home after school every day and do homework and chores and wait for my mother to come home which i 'd heat up on the stove as my afternoon snack if i had a little extra money i 'd buy a hostess fruit pie laughter cherry not as good as a buttermilk drop my daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove unless there 's a grown up at home and she doesn 't have to because she does not have to have the same kind of self reliance that i had to at her age my kids ' raviolis are organic and full of things i am the exception or cared any more than theresa marginalized communities are full they are full of people applying their savvy intelligence to stretch a minimum wage paycheck or balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet full of people doing for themselves and for others whether it 's or letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill i am the exception because of luck and privilege not hard work and i 'm not being modest or people work hard hard work is the is the common denominator in this equation and i 'm tired of the story we tell that hard work leads to success because that allows thank you because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it and by implication those who don 't make it don 't deserve it we tell ourselves in the back of our minds and sometimes in the front of our mouths there must be something a little wrong with those poor people we have a wide range of beliefs about what that something wrong is some people tell the story that poor folks are lazy freeloaders who would cheat and lie to get out of an honest day 's work others prefer the story that poor people are helpless and probably had neglectful parents that didn 't read to them enough and if they were just told what to do and shown the right path they could make it for every story i hear demonizing low income single mothers or absentee fathers which is how people might think of my parents i 've got fifty that tell a different story about the same people showing up every day and doing their best i 'm not saying that some of the negative stories aren 't true but those stories allow us to not really see who people really are because they don 't paint a full picture the quarter truths and limited plot lines have us convinced that poor people are a problem that needs fixing what if we recognized that what 's working is the people and what 's broken is our approach what if we realized that the experts we are looking for the experts we need to follow are poor people themselves what if instead of imposing solutions we just added fire to the already burning flame that they have not directing not even empowering but just fueling their initiative just north of here we have an example of what this could look like silicon valley a whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief that if people have good ideas we should give them lots and lots and but where is our strategy for theresa and baakir no fellowships how are jobana sintia and bertha really all that different from the mark zuckerbergs of the world baakir has experience and a track record i 'd put my money on him so consider this an invitation let 's grasp this opportunity to let go of a tired faulty narrative and listen and look for true stories more beautifully complex stories about who marginalized people and families and communities are i 'm going to take a minute to speak to my people let us remember what we are capable of all that we have built with blood sweat and dreams all the cogs that keep turning and the people kept afloat because of our backbreaking work let us remember that we are magic read octavia butler 's parable of the sower listen to reverend king 's letter from birmingham jail listen to suheir hammad recite first writing since or esperanza spalding perform black gold set your gaze upon the art of kehinde at the hands of your grandmother individually we don 't have a lot of wealth and power but collectively we are unstoppable and we spend a lot of our time and energy organizing let 's use some of our substantial collective power toward inventing and bringing to life new ways of being that work for us desmond tutu talks about he says it means we belong to a bundle of life a bundle of life the truth and reconciliation process started by elevating the voices if this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all then we need to elevate the voices of our unheard of people like theresa and baakir we must leverage their solutions and their thank you"
