  "transcript": "we all know that ants and other insects at this size scale can do some pretty incredible things we 've all seen a group of ants or some version of that but what are the real challenges of engineering these ants well first of all how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale well first we need to figure out how to make them move when they 're so small we need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomotion and we need the sensors power and control in order to pull everything together in a so insects move around amazingly well and it 's able to do this because its legs are a and soft materials jumping is another really interesting way to get around when you 're very small so one of the big contributions from my lab has been to combine rigid and soft materials in very very and the basic idea is that we 're going to compress this store energy in the springs and then release it to jump so there 's no motors on board this right now no power this is actuated with a method that we call in my lab graduate student with tweezers and what you see is this mechanism jumping almost forty centimeters high that 's almost one hundred times its own length and it survives bounces on the table it 's incredibly robust and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it 's very tiny so this leads to the robot that i showed you earlier we all move in this kind of bouncy way when we run so this guy doesn 't work and we 've gotten this to run about ten body lengths per second so ten centimeters per second it 's pretty quick for a little small guy and that 's really only limited by our test setup but we can also make and not everything needs to be so this robot 's about the size of a tic tac and in this case instead of magnets or muscles to move this around so you have this robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air it 's only four by four by seven millimeters in size and you can see the robot jumping up and it jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it so i think you can imagine all the cool things that we could do with robots that can or imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge in order to inspect it and make sure it 's safe so you don 't get collapses like this which happened outside of minneapolis in two thousand and seven or just imagine what you could do if you had robots that could swim through your blood or we could radically change the way we build things if we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do and they build these incredible eight meter high mounds effectively and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination thanks very much"
