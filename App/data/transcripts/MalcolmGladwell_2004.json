  "transcript": "i think i was supposed to talk about my new book which is called blink and it 's about snap judgments and first impressions and it comes out in january and i hope you all buy it in triplicate and so i decided instead i would talk about someone who i think has done as much to make americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last twenty years a man who is a great personal hero of mine someone by the name of howard moskowitz who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce and he 's and he 's in his 60s and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality and he has a parrot and he by profession he 's a psychophysicist now i should tell you that i have no idea what psychophysics is although at some point in my life i dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics which should tell you something as far as i know psychophysics is about measuring things and howard is very interested in measuring things and he and one of his first clients was pepsi this is many years ago back in the early and pepsi came to howard and they said you know there 's this new thing called aspartame and we would like to make diet pepsi we 'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of diet pepsi in order to have the perfect drink now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer anything above twelve percent sweetness is too sweet we want to know what 's the sweet spot between eight if i gave you this problem to do you would all say it 's very simple what we do is you make up a big experimental batch of pepsi at every degree of sweetness eight percent eight point one eight point two eight point three all the way up to twelve really simple and all of a sudden he realizes it 's not a nice bell curve most people in that business in the world of testing food and such are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess they think well you know figuring out what people think about cola 's not that easy you know maybe we made an error somewhere along the way right in the middle howard is not so easily placated howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards and this was not good enough for him and this question bedeviled him for years and he would think it through and say what was wrong why could we not make sense of this experiment with diet pepsi and one day he was sitting in a diner in white plains about to go trying to dream up some work for and that is that when they analyzed the diet pepsi data they were asking the wrong question trust me this was an enormous revelation and he would go to conferences around the country and he would stand up and you should be looking for the perfect pepsis and people would look at him blankly and say what are you talking about craziness and they would say move next tried to get business nobody would hire him he was obsessed though and he talked about it and talked about it howard loves the yiddish expression to a worm in horseradish the world is horseradish this was his horseradish he was obsessed with it we want to make the perfect pickle and he said there is no perfect pickle there are only perfect pickles and he came back to them and he said you don 't to improve your regular you need to create zesty and that 's where we got zesty pickles campbell 's soup is where 80s was struggling which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the in the industry i don 't know whether you care about this or how much time i have to go into this but it was technically speaking prego is a better tomato sauce than rag 70s with rag and prego you 'd have a plate of spaghetti and you would pour it on right and the rag would all go to the bottom and the prego would sit on top that 's called and the quality of their tomato paste and howard looked at their product line and he said what you have is a and he got together with the campbell 's soup kitchen and he made by sweetness by level of garlic by tomatoey ness by tartness by sourness by visible solids my favorite term in the and then he took this whole raft of spaghetti sauces and he went on the road he and he sat them down for two hours and over the course of that two hours he gave them ten bowls ten small bowls of pasta with a different spaghetti sauce on each one and after they ate to rate from zero to one hundred how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was at the end of that process after doing it for months and months he had a mountain of data about how the american people feel and then he analyzed the data did he look for the most popular let 's see if we can group all these different data points into and there are people who like extra chunky and prego turned to howard and they said you 're telling me that one third of americans crave spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs and he said and prego then went back and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country they made six hundred million dollars off their line of extra chunky sauces and that 's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar and fourteen different kinds of of mustard and seventy one different kinds of olive oil and then eventually even rag hired howard and howard did the exact same thing for rag that he did for prego and today if you go to a really good supermarket do you know how many rags there are that 's howard 's doing that is howard 's gift to the american people now why is that important what howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat what will make people happy is to ask them tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce and for all those years twenty thirty years through all those focus group sessions deep in their hearts actually did as howard loves to say the mind knows not what the tongue wants it 's a mystery if i asked all of you for example in this room what you want in a coffee you know what you every one of you would say i want a dark you will never ever say to someone who asks you what you want that i want a milky weak coffee so that 's number one thing that howard did number two thing that howard did is he he made us realize it 's another very critical point he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call horizontal segmentation why is this critical because this is the way the food industry thought before howard what were they obsessed with in the early 80s they were obsessed with mustard in particular they were obsessed with the story of grey poupon there were two mustards french 's and gulden 's what were they yellow mustard what 's in it yellow mustard seeds turmeric and paprika that was mustard grey poupon came along with a dijon more volatile brown mustard seed some white wine a nose hit much more delicate aromatics and what do they do they put it in a little tiny glass jar with a wonderful enameled label on it made it look french even though it 's made in oxnard california and instead of charging a dollar fifty for and they had those ads with the guy in the rolls royce and everyone 's take home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive something to aspire to and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy a better mustard a more expensive mustard a mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning and howard looked to that and said that 's wrong mustard does not exist on a hierarchy mustard there is no good there is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard there are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people he fundamentally we owe howard moskowitz a huge vote of thanks and perhaps the most important is howard confronted the notion of the platonic dish what do i mean by that you go to red tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction you just get the reduction why because the chef at chez panisse has a platonic notion about this is the way it ought to be and she serves it that way time and time again and if you quarrel with her she will say you know what you 're wrong this is the they had a platonic notion of what tomato sauce was and where did that come from it came from italy italian tomato sauce is what it 's blended it 's thin the culture of tomato sauce was thin when we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970s we talked about italian tomato sauce we talked about the earliest rags which had no visible solids right which were thin you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta that 's what it was and why were we attached to that because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most then they would embrace it and that 's what would please the maximum number of people they were looking for one way to treat all of us and it 's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals because all of science but that changed it is the movement from the search for universals we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer i guess my cancer different what howard moskowitz was doing was saying this same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce and for that we owe him a great vote of thanks i 'll and that is oh i 'm sorry howard not only believed that but he took it a second step which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food and coffee is something he did a lot of work with with nescaf if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee a type of coffee a brew and then i asked you if however you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters maybe three or four coffee clusters and i could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters your scores would go from sixty to the difference between coffee at sixty and coffee at seventy eight is a difference between coffee that makes you wince and coffee that makes you deliriously happy that is the final and i think most beautiful lesson of howard moskowitz that in embracing the diversity we will find a surer way to true happiness"
