  "transcript": "there really is only one place to go and that is the dark net anonymous markets now you can 't get to these sites with a normal browser chrome or firefox known as tor hidden services where urls are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in onion and which you access with a special browser called the tor browser now and it allows anybody to browse and it does this but it 's also your key to the dark and because of this fiendishly clever encryption system the twenty or thirty we don 't know exactly thousand sites it is a world visited by anonymous users little wonder then that it 's it 's a natural place to go for need not be illegal but you 'll also find and much exciting places takes place in world class universities it also takes place in the fringes because those on the fringes the pariahs the outcasts they 're often the they have to be you will not find a single lolcat a single pop up advert anywhere and that 's one of the reasons why i think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon not that i 'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high quality narcotics but let 's say for a moment that you were the first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks every single product high res image a detailed you make your choice you pay with you enter an address preferably not your home address and you wait for your product to arrive in the and the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption that 's important something far simpler than that it 's the user reviews but they keep the same pseudonym to build a reputation and because it 's easy for the buyer the only way of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site and this introduction of competition and choice does exactly what the economists and the vendors are attentive they 're polite they 're consumer centric offering you all manner of special deals he had via the internal emailing system that 's also encrypted of course i 'm new here do you mind if i buy just starting small is a wise thing to do i would too if i were you best wishes now this kind of attitude is the reason why when i reviewed one hundred and twenty thousand pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three month period ninety five percent of them were five out of five but what does that mean the one hand that means there are more drugs more available more easily to more people and by my reckoning that is not a good thing but on the other hand if you are going to take drugs you have a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality which is incredibly important if you 're taking drugs and you can do so from the comfort of your own home without the risks associated with buying on the streets now as i said you 've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace and the twenty or so sites that are currently in operation by the way they don 't always work they 're not always perfect the site that i showed you was shut down eighteen months ago before it had turned over over a billion dollars ' worth of trade harder to censor and more you don 't pay with your credit card of course that would lead directly back to you so you use the crypto currency bitcoin which is easily exchanged for real world currencies some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples ' bitcoin before they 'd mailed the drugs out the community came up with a solution called so on purchasing my item i would send my bitcoin to a neutral secure third digital wallet and then when i received it at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction vendor buyer site administrator would have to sign the transaction off elegant it works but then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger so if you if you 're clever you can try and work out who 's behind them so they came up with a tumbling service hundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address they 're tumbled and jumbled up and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients but they 're different bitcoins you can even buy some advertising space are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing yeah one vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine that 's not being sourced from colombian druglords but guatemalan farmers they even promised to reinvest twenty percent of any profits into local education now whatever you think about the morality of these sites and i submit that it 's not actually an easy question the creation of functioning competitive anonymous where nobody knows who anybody else is and it 's that kind of innovation that 's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come it 's easy to forget that because the internet has actually changed many times over the last thirty years or so it started in the ' 70s as a military project morphed in the 1980s to an academic network co opted by commercial companies in the ' 90s and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties and i think things like the dark net markets difficult to censor and the reason it 's the future we 're worried about what happens to our data we 're worried about who might be watching us since the revelations from edward snowden using various tools there are now between two and three million daily users of the tor browser the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate sometimes even mundane and there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online ethereum which is a project which tries to link up the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world to create a sort of distributed internet but you add distributed computing and powerful encryption that 's very very hard and so on and so on and here 's the thing the and so on and i think that 's what 's going to happen in fact the dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle blowers it 's already going mainstream the musician aphex twin released his album facebook has started a group of london architects have opened a dark net site for people worried about regeneration projects every social media company every major news outlet and therefore most of you in this audience will be using the dark net too so the internet is about to get more interesting more exciting more innovative more terrible destructive that 's good news if you care about liberty it 's good news if you care about freedom it 's good news if you care about democracy it 's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity but both thank you very much"
