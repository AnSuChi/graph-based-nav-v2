  "transcript": "today i 'm going to talk about work and the question i want to ask and answer is this why do we work why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from one ted like adventure to another now i know of course we have to make a living but nobody in this room thinks that that 's the answer to the question why do we work for folks in this room it might even be important but that 's not why we do what we do and in general i think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do when we say of somebody that he 's in it for the money we are not just being descriptive but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question why if this is so obvious why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet the work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning how is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work that is monotonous soul deadening workers who do this kind of work whether they do it in factories in call centers or in fulfillment warehouses do it for pay so the question is why and here 's the answer now i know i know yeah yeah yeah technology automation screws people blah blah that 's not what i mean i 'm not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives and that people profound though that is i call it idea technology how clever of me in addition to creating things science creates ideas science creates ways of understanding and in social sciences the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves and they have an enormous influence on how we think what we aspire to and how we act if you think your poverty is god 's will you pray if you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy and if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination then you rise up in revolt depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty this is the role that ideas play in shaping us as as human beings and this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology that science gives us and there 's something special about idea technology if the technology sucks right bad technology disappears with ideas false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe and that because the father one of the fathers of the industrial revolution adam smith was convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy and wouldn 't do anything unless you made it worth their while and the way you made it worth their while was by incentivizing by giving them rewards that was the only reason anyone ever did anything so we created a factory system consistent with that false it is not true that you just can 't get good help anymore is true and interestingly enough adam smith the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production and division of labor generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become now notice the word here is become he generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become whether he intended it or not what adam smith was telling us there is that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted and have complete confidence that the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories it 's going to work the same damn way but we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature because human nature will be changed by the theories we have that are designed to explain and help us understand human beings the distinguished years ago that human beings are the unfinished animals and what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live that human nature that is to say our human nature is much more created than it is discovered and so you people pretty much the closest i ever get to being with masters of the universe you people should be asking yourself thank you"
