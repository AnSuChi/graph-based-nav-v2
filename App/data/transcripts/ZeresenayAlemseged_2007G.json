  "transcript": "i have eighteen minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years all right and converged in this region of africa which is a place where ninety percent of our evolutionary and i say that not because i am african but it 's in africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors so we all are africans and welcome home all right i 'm a paleoanthropologist and my job is to define man 's place in nature and explore what makes us human and today i will use selam the earliest child ever discovered to tell you a story of all of us she belongs to the species known as australopithecus you don 't need to remember that that 's the lucy species and was found by my research team and selam means peace in many ethiopian languages we use that name to celebrate peace in the region and and the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of i think and i learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools two point six million years ago and you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time and dna analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species i think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry dna analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end telling us nothing about what happened in the middle so for us paleoanthropologists our job is to find the hard evidence the fossil evidence to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development because it 's only when you do that that you can talk about and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time but finding the hard evidence is a very endeavor it 's a hostile and often with no access just to give you an example when i went to dikika where selam was found in ' ninety nine it took us only seven hours to do the first four hundred seventy kilometers of the five hundred but took four solid hours to do the last only thirty kilometers with the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks i made my way i was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot when you get there this is what you see and it 's the vastness of the place which makes you helpless and vulnerable and the big question is where to start and you find nothing for years and years when i go to places like this which are paleontological sites it 's like but what you find are not the human remains such as selam and lucy on a but you could ask how could these large mammals live in this desert environment of course they cannot but i 'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this anyway once we made it and our ancestors lived in that game park but were just the minorities they were not as successful and as widespread as the homo sapiens that we are to tell you just an example an anecdote about their rarity i was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here and the assistants of course helped me do the surveys one of my assistants who never went to school said to me listen zeray you either don 't know what you 're looking for or you 're looking in the wrong place he said and i said why because there were elephants and lions and the people were scared and went somewhere else let 's go somewhere else it was then after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found selam and you see the face here covered by sandstone and here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block because she was buried by a river what you have here seems to be nothing but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human this is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology an amazing piece of our long long history and i am taking the pictures that 's why i am not in the feeling i had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility of making sure everything is safe here is a close up of the fossil after five years of cleaning preparation and description but and here is full scale it 's a tiny bone because you don 't leave anyone with this kind of child even a minister once you 've done then it was possible to compare we were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs the foot and some features clearly showed that she walked upright and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity but in addition if you and you don 't see this very projecting canine so she belongs to our family tree but within that of course you do detailed analysis and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species known as australopithecus afarensis and how old was she when she died you can determine the the sex of the individual based on how you know in primates there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with and you say how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth and the answer was three so this girl so with all that information the big question is what do we actually what does she tell us to answer this question we can phrase another question what do we actually know about our ancestors we want to know how they looked like how they behaved how they walked around and how they lived and grew up and among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included first this skeleton documents for the first time how infants looked over three million years ago and second if you have a still growing brain it 's a human behavior that 's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth faster faster than us anyway so the still growing brain in this individual which requires an incredible by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history selam but not and i will give you a very exciting example this is called the hyoid bone it 's a bone which is right here it supports your tongue from behind and we have it in this skeleton it was clear that it if you were there three point three million years ago to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human maybe you 're wondering so you see this ape feature human feature ape feature what does that tell us you know that is very exciting for us because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively and that evolution is in the making to summarize the significance of this fossil we can say the following up to now the knowledge that we had about our our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals so the knowledge that we had about our ancestors on how they looked like how they behaved was kind of biased toward adults imagine the children and he goes back and reports can you imagine how much biased his so i think the new fossil fixes this problem so i think the most important question at the end is what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general of course in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human you know the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years and there are more than ten but they would very much be very proud of because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe and they were probably not aware of this future legacy but they did great now the question is we homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of and can we really do better than these primitive small brained ancestors among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic needless to list them here and there are more competent people to talk about this still in my opinion we have two choices one is to continue to see a poor ill crying africa carrying guns that depends on other people forever or to promote an africa which is confident peaceful independent but cognizant of its huge problems and and i 'm sure many of you are and the key is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa that 's because we africans concentrate i am from ethiopia by the way we concentrate too much on how we are seen from i think it 's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves that 's what i call positive african attitude so finally i would like to say so let 's help africa thank you"
