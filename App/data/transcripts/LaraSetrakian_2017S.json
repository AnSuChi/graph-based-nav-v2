  "transcript": "i had my dream job but there was a crack in the wall a problem with our industry that i felt we needed to fix you see i got to the middle east but by the time i got there it was already nearly impossible to find stories about iraq on air and of the stories that did make it more than eighty percent of them were about us we were missing the stories about iraq the people who live there afghanistan had already fallen off the agenda there were less than one percent of all news stories in two thousand and eight that went to the war in afghanistan but information was so scarce that schoolteachers we spoke to told us they had trouble explaining and it wasn 't just iraq and afghanistan from conflict zones to climate change to all sorts of issues around crises in public health we were missing what i call the we were facing certain practical implications and where the people working on the issues were invisible to us and sometimes invisible to each other back on iraq those years when we were missing the story were the years when the society was falling apart when we were setting the conditions for what would become the rise of isis the isis takeover of mosul and terrorist violence that would spread beyond iraq 's borders to the rest of the world that time where i was making that observation i looked across the border of iraq and noticed there was another story we were missing i felt like called syria deeply and for the past four years it 's been a resource for policymakers and professionals working on the conflict in syria we built a business and we found it was a model that scaled we got passionate requests to do other things deeply i 'm just one of many entrepreneurs and we are just one of many start ups trying to fix what 's wrong with news trust in the media has hit an all time low and the statistic you 're seeing up there is from september you can call me and i want to share three of them that we 've picked up in our own work we need news that 's built on deep domain knowledge given the waves and waves of layoffs at newsrooms across the country we 've lost the art of specialization beat reporting is an endangered thing when it comes to foreign news the way we can fix that is by working with more local journalists treating them like our partners and collaborators not just fixers who fetch us phone numbers and sound bites our local reporters in syria and across africa and across asia bring us stories that we certainly would not have found on our own like this one from the suburbs of or this one from the border of pakistan about afghan refugees being forced to return home before they under the threat of police intimidation and they bring us stories that are important for all of us to know a pledge to first do no harm journalists need to be tough and we need to recognize when what we 're doing could potentially harm society where we lose track of journalism as a public service i watched us cover the ebola crisis we launched ebola deeply we did our best but what we saw was a public that was flooded with hysterical and sensational coverage sometimes inaccurate sometimes completely wrong because by sparking more panic and by sometimes getting the facts wrong we made it harder for people to resolve what was actually happening on the ground all that noise made it harder to make the right decisions go that way next time because the next deadly virus that comes around could be much worse if our reporting isn 't responsible and it isn 't right embrace complexity we live in a complex world news our job as journalists to get elbow deep in complexity and to find new ways to make it easier for everyone else to understand if we don 't do that if we pretend there are just simple answers we 're leading everyone off a steep cliff understanding complexity is the only way to know the real threats that are around the corner it 's our responsibility to translate those threats and to help you understand what 's real so you can be prepared and know what it takes to i honestly believe i know we can fix the news and i truly believe that in the end we 're going to get this right"
