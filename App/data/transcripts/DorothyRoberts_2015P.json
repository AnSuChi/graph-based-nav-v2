  "transcript": "i volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test when i arrived at the clinic to be tested i was handed a questionnaire one of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race i wasn 't quite sure how to answer the question was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants ' social backgrounds i would answer with my social identity and check the box for black but what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits and how could they make scientific findings about my genes if i put down my social identity as a black 't worry about it just put down however you identify yourself so i check black but i had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically that personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions well i found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice prescriptions even the very definition of diseases and the more i found out the more disturbed i became sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction asian native american latina we 're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world i 've also studied how lawmakers not and it 's not just the view of social scientists you remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a white house ceremony in june two thousand president bill clinton famously declared i believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms human beings are more than ninety nine point nine percent the same echoed president clinton the only race we 're talking about is the human race doctors are supposed to practice evidence based medicine and they 're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution but their habit of treating this important indicator of kidney function by race as you can see in this lab test the exact same creatinine i 've been told it 's based on an assumption that but what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume wouldn 't it be far more accurate and it 's a crude but convenient proxy enzyme level genetic traits they just don 't have time to look for but race is a bad proxy but race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures family illnesses their history their own illnesses they might have all more than the patient 's race race can 't substitute for these important doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account but there are numerous medical tests like the gfr that use race categorically to treat black white asian patients differently just because of their race race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes black and latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain exaggerate their pain and are predisposed to drug addiction the food and drug administration has even approved a medicine it 's a pill called bidil to treat heart failure in patients a cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients the fda then allowed the company the drug company to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included it speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or but think about the dangerous message it sent that black people 's bodies are so substandard a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients in the end the drug company 's marketing scheme failed for one thing black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people one elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted give me what the white people are taking wait until you learn that many doctors in the united states still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery dr samuel cartwright graduated from the university of pennsylvania medical school and he was a well known expert on what was then called negro medicine he promoted the racial concept of disease that people of different races suffer from different diseases that slavery was beneficial for black people he wrote in a medical journal it is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man 's control and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom to support this theory cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called doctors still uphold cartwright 's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people some even use a modern day that actually has a so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race it 's a well known function called correcting for race its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health lack of access to high quality medical care high rates of incarceration and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination you see race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences but because of the impact of social inequality on people 's health yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race specific pill it 's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix the reason i 'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn 't just because it 's bad medicine i 'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we 've been learning about there 's a failure of imagination when it comes to race what would happen if doctors stopped suppose they rejected 18th century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity what if instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor what if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism not by genetic difference race medicine is bad medicine it 's poor science and it 's a false interpretation of it is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy"
