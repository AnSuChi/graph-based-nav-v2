  "transcript": "and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island in assessing the merits of such 's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor 's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins once upon a time and a sea story begins this ain 't no shit nevertheless there are giants in the ocean and we now have video proof as those of you that saw the discovery channel documentary are no doubt aware expedition that took place last summer off japan i 'm the short one the other two are dr tsunemi kubodera and dr steve o 'shea i owe my participation in this now historic event to ted in two thousand and ten there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earle 's ted wish i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean one that focuses on which is the hunt for the giant squid it was mike that got me invited to the squid summit a gathering of squid experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week unobtrusive platforms for farting around in the dark remote operated vehicles but that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems so my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make so i set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean and i had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made the tiburon also uses these days use hydraulics and they sound like the ventana i think that 's got to be so for the deep sea squid hunt i proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with but it 's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea so this camera platform which we called the medusa could just be thrown off the back of the ship attached to a float at the surface with over two thousand feet of line it would just and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure which we called the electronic jellyfish or e jelly because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish atolla now this pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish but it 's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it 's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a and a common form of defense in the deep sea whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of it was like it was teasing us doing a kind of fan dance now you see me now you don 't and we had four and then on the fifth it came in and totally wowed us what really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it which i think it mistook for the predator on the e jelly but even more incredible was the footage shot from the triton submersible what was not mentioned in the discovery documentary was that the bait squid that and i think it was this light that brought the giant in what you 're seeing is the intensified camera 's view under red light and that 's all dr kubodera could see when the giant comes in here and then he got so excited bringing a creature of legend from the misty it would have been as tall as a how could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can 't even yet imagine yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we 've spent on space exploration we need a nasa like organization for ocean exploration we need"
