  "transcript": "and i know in the light of human suffering and poverty and even climate change why worry about a few cats well today we 're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character this leopard dereck joubert well our lives have basically been like a super long episode of csi something like twenty eight years in essence what we 've done is we 've studied the science we 've looked but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality that individual personality that these animals have and here 's a prime example we found this leopard in a baobab tree in africa and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us and the minute we found this leopard we realized that we needed to move in and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four and a half years that individual personality of hers and really coming to know her now i 'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique very very special individualistic and often seductive female characters and this little leopard legadema is another and she changed our lives bj well we certainly did spend a lot of time with we would stay and film and early on we looked at it and said my gosh what 's going to happen with that little cub 's probably going to forever associate that deafening crash with us shivering we called her legadema which means light from the sky dj now we 've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals in particular in the cats this particular one is called but only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have but i must tell you every day is exhilarating because we 're driving through water and searching and filming the iconic cats dj now one of the big things of course everybody knows that cats hate water and so this was a real revelation for us and we could only find this by pushing ourselves by going where no sane person should go not without some prompting by the way from beverly and just pushing the envelope going out there pushing our and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water bj and then of course the challenge is knowing when to turn around we don 't always get that right we got deeper and deeper until it was at dereck 's and we seriously submerged the vehicle we actually managed to drown two million dollars ' worth of camera gear and we seized the engine dj and of course one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles you will notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by beverly the dry top angle by the way but all the places we get stuck in really have great views and it wasn 't a moment and these lions came back towards us and beverly was able to get a great photograph bj but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage we did a film called eternal enemies where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species lions and hyenas and surprisingly it became a cult film and we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and he is going to get it animal but that 's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters but we live by certain rules of engagement and we can 't step in and say that 's wrong and that 's right but that 's not always easy for us bj so push ourselves at night sleep deprivation is extreme and i have to tell you but i knew and i do believe you should stay with us dj the amazing thing about these moments and this is probably a highlight of our career is that you never know how it 's going to end not in the lungs and that 's when people give up hope and you can see the start of it here this elephant but by the same token so just when you think it 's all over something else happens some spark gets into you some sort of will to fight that that iron will that we all have that this elephant has that conservation has that big cats everything has that will to survive to fight to push through that mental barrier and to keep going and for us in many ways a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work now back to the leopard we were perhaps taking her for granted and maybe she didn 't like that that much this is about couples working together and so i do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories beverly and i beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is and i 'm on the other side where my space is these divides bj it was phenomenal and we felt grateful that she trusted us to it might not turn out the same way she might get shot for that so dereck turned on the heater only way for me to save the marriage because beverly felt she was being replaced you see but nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her when she started hunting bj but only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother 's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here so what we watched over the next couple of hours was very unique it was and over the next five hours she took care of it we realized that we actually don 't know everything and that nature is so unpredictable we have to be open at all times dj okay so she was a little bit rough what we were seeing here was interesting because she is a cub and yet conflicted in some way because she was also an emerging mother she had this maternal instinct much like a young girl on her way to and so this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality bj but i have to tell you everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights and so we with the national geographic formed the big cats initiative to march forward into conservation taking care of the big cats that we loved and then had an opportunity to look back over the last fifty years to so when beverly and i were born there were four hundred and fifty thousand lions and today there are twenty thousand tigers haven 't fared any better down to maybe three thousand bj and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to twelve thousand have plummeted from seven hundred thousand down to a mere fifty thousand now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with legadema which is really over a five year period and we fear them it used to be the time where only kings looking at this lion paw that has been skinned it eerily reminds me of a human hand and that 's ironic because their fate is in our hands dj and so in a stroke the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers so we have a real problem here no more so than the lions do the male lions so the twenty thousand lion figure that you because there may be three thousand or four thousand male lions and they all are actually infected with the same disease i call it complacency and that 's probably because we haven 't seen it like we are today bj and you have to know that when a male lion is killed it completely disrupts the whole pride and of course first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs so we 've estimated that between twenty killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far off place dj ecotourism revenue stream into africa so this is not just a concern about lions it 's a concern about de link ourselves from nature as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals we lose that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet bj looking into the eyes of lions and leopards right now and so what we are doing in february we 're bringing out a film called the last lion and the last lion is exactly what is happening right now that is the situation we 're in the last lions that is if we don 't take action and do something these and simply if we can 't protect them we 're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well dj and in fact that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by that conservation was all about respect and celebration is probably true that 's really what it needs we and we need to continue that well we can report in fact that we 're grandparents"
