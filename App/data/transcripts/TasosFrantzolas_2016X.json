  "transcript": "want to start by doing an experiment i 'm but i 've replaced the audio of one of the videos and instead of the sound of rain i 've added the sound of bacon frying so i want you think carefully which one the clip with the bacon is my point here isn 't really to make you hungry every time you see a rainy scene but it 's to show that our brains are conditioned to embrace the lies so on the subject of deception i wanted to quote one of my favorite authors in the decay of lying oscar wilde establishes the idea that all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic so when you 're watching a movie everything apart from the dialogue is fake when you watch a movie and you see a bird flapping its wings they haven 't really recorded the bird it sounds a lot more realistic if you record a sheet or shaking kitchen gloves the burning of a cigarette up close it actually sounds a lot more authentic if you take a small saran wrap ball and release it no one was really harmed it 's actually breaking celery or frozen lettuce as easy as a trip to the supermarket and going to the vegetable section but it 's often a lot more complicated than that so let 's together the creation of a sound effect one of my favorite stories comes from frank he 's a contributor to our library and a great sound designer of the paramount team that won the oscar for best sound for the hunt for red october in this cold war classic in the ' 90s they were asked to produce the sound of the propeller of the submarine so they had a small problem they couldn 't really find a submarine in west hollywood so basically what they did is and frank performed a cannonball or bomba they placed an underwater mic and an overhead mic outside the swimming pool so here 's what the underwater mic sounds like pitched it one octave down sort of like slowing down a record and then they removed a lot of the high frequencies and pitched it down another octave and then they added a little bit of and by looping and repeating that sound they got this churns so creativity and technology put together in order to create the illusion that we 're inside so this is the first audio tool i want to talk about reverberation or reverb is the persistence of the sound after the original sound has ended so it 's sort of like the original sound is less than half a second long we can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom gunshot reverbs in bathroom gives us a lot of information about the space between the listener and the original sound source if the sound is the taste then reverb is sort of like the smell of the sound but reverb can do a lot more listening to a sound with a lot less reverberation than the on screen action is going to immediately signify to us that we 're listening to a commentator in cinema are often heard with zero reverb because that 's how it would sound if someone was speaking inside our ear adding a lot of reverb to a voice is going to make us think that we 're listening to a flashback or perhaps that we 're inside the head of a character or that we 're listening to the voice of god or even more powerful here 's a really big one it 's silence a few moments of silence is going to make us pay attention and in the western so silence preceding verbal communication where it 's full of explosions and automatic automatic guns loud stops being loud anymore it depends how it 's used in each film we often but silence becomes a blank canvas upon which there is no such thing as but there was never a silent moment because of the sound of the projector and even in today 's dolby world there 's not really any moment of silence you listen around you there 's always some sort of noise as a synonym they often use are the unique background sounds that are specific to each location each location has a unique sound and each room has a unique sound which is called room tone so here 's a recording of a market in morocco voices music and here 's a recording of times square in new york the heating the fridge here 's a recording of my apartment in brooklyn birds chirping outside your window may indicate normality we 've been used to that sound every morning for millions of years birds on the other hand industrial sounds have been introduced to us a little more recently splet industrial sounds often carry negative connotations now sound effects can tap into our emotional memory occasionally they can be so significant that they become a character in a movie the sound of thunder may indicate divine intervention or anger church bells can remind us of the passing of time or perhaps our own mortality ring and breaking of glass can indicate the end of a relationship or a friendship played very loud may remind us of animal howls in nature and therefore create a sense of irritation or fear be seen that 's what we call offscreen sounds or sounds i think the mathematician and philosopher thought that in that way rather than the visual of him speaking so sort of like the wizard of oz or one separating the voice from its separating cause and effect sort of creates a sense of ubiquity or there 's a strong tradition of acousmatic sound nuns in monasteries in rome and venice used to sing in rooms up in galleries close to the ceiling creating the illusion that we 're listening to angels up in the sky aphex twin famously hid in dark corners of clubs i think what all these masters knew is that by hiding the source you create a sense of mystery this has been seen in cinema over and over with hitchcock and ridley scott in and if all this sounds a little theoretical i wanted to play a little video sort of trying to to demonstrate with these tools it can change the mood it can set the pace it can make us laugh or it can make us scared and somehow managed to make it into some sort of and i think with our work through the sound library we 're trying to kind of expand the vocabulary of that language and filmmakers and video game and so thanks for listening"
