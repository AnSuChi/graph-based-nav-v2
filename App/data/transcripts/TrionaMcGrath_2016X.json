  "transcript": "do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives they provide half the oxygen we and they provide jobs and medicine and food including twenty percent of protein to feed the entire world population well today i 'm going to tell you about a serious reality that is changing our oceans called ocean acidification or the evil twin of climate change did you know that the oceans have absorbed now this is just another great service provided by the oceans since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that 's causing climate change but as we keep pumping more and more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere more is dissolving into the oceans and this is what 's changing our ocean chemistry when carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater it undergoes a number of chemical reactions and this basically means that there scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades this figure is an important time series in hawaii and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide the line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean the line on the bottom and we too are seeing acidification at the same rate as these now i 'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data to to monitor a changing ocean firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter so as you can imagine in the north atlantic we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness but such as temperature or dissolved oxygen and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface but why should we care how is ocean acidification going to affect all of us well here are the worrying facts there has already been an increase in ocean acidity of twenty six percent we 're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of one hundred and seventy percent i mean this is within our children 's lifetime this rate of which was much slower and this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well but many are showing a negative response one of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases the now these ions are basically the building blocks for many marine species to make their shells for example crabs they also need these carbonate ions in seawater to make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs as ocean acidity increases they can actually begin to dissolve this here is a pteropod it 's called a sea butterfly from krill to salmon right up to whales after only forty five days at this very realistic ph you can see the shell has almost completely ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain and right onto our dinner plates i mean who here likes shellfish or salmon or many other fish species whose food source in the ocean could be affected and did you know we actually have cold water corals in irish waters just off our continental and they support rich biodiversity including some very important fisheries it seventy percent of all known cold water corals in the entire ocean will be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure the last example i have are these healthy tropical corals they were placed in seawater at a ph now coral reefs support percent of all marine life in the entire ocean all marine life so you can i dread to think what our oceans will look like when he 's a grown man but we can slow this this is important for both you and i for industry for governments we need to work together slow down global warming slow down ocean acidification and help to maintain a healthy ocean and a healthy planet for our generation and for generations to come"
