  "transcript": "you may not realize this but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers and like writing software we can print and write dna into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria what this program does is produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize as you 're seeing in this movie and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast now our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density you can observe quorum sensing where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards this particular movie and experiment we call the supernova because it looks like an exploding star and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive we realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine we 've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer or even other diseases and to share this vision i worked with artist vik muniz to create the symbol of the universe my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe thank you"
