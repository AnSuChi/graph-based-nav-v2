  "transcript": "the public debate about architecture quite often just stays on contemplating the final result the architectural object is the latest tower in london a gherkin or a sausage or a sex tool so recently we asked ourselves if we could invent a format that could actually tell the stories behind the projects maybe combining images and drawings and words to actually sort of and we discovered that we didn 't have to invent it so we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidents of the real world we call this comic book yes is more after him followed the a bore after him philip johnson sort of introduced you could say promiscuity or at least openness to new ideas with i am a whore and what we 'd like to say with yes is more is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant garde is almost always negatively defined as who or what we are against the cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment we 're much more interested in evolution this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising the changes of the world in fact i actually think that darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work and through a process of architectural selection we might choose a really beautiful model or we might have a very functional model we mate and through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design a very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in copenhagen the design process was but gradually an idea evolved this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city sort of expanding sometimes a subspecies branches off and quite often we sit in a design meeting there is this great idea it doesn 't really work in this context but for another client in another culture it could really be the right answer to a to a different question and what i 'd like to do now in and we saw this guy in fact he looked like a building we had designed for a hotel in the north of sweden when we submitted it for the swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme but it didn 't exactly look like something from the north of sweden but then we had a meeting with a chinese businessman who saw our design and said wow that 's the chinese character for the word ' people ' so apparently this is how you write people as in the people 's republic of china so we hired a feng shui master we scaled the building up three times to chinese proportions and went to china laughter so the people 's building as we called it this is our two interpreters sort of reading the and he said shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over and with the people 's building he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of china and the chen is now in prison for corruption laughter but like i said haibao looked very familiar because he is actually the chinese character for and they chose this mascot because the theme of you 're not supposed to take long warm showers you 're not supposed to fly on holidays because it 's bad for the environment so we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on we also asked ourselves what could denmark possibly show china that would be relevant you know it 's one of the biggest countries in the world one of the smallest china symbolized by the dragon denmark we have a national bird the swan china has many great but we discovered that in the people 's republic public school curriculum they have three fairy tales by an tu sheng or hans christian anderson as we call him so that means that all one point three billion chinese have grown up with the emperor 's new clothes the matchstick girl and the little mermaid the biggest tourist attraction in china is the great wall the great wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon this is how it looks today all traffic bicycles have become forbidden many places we have a free system of bicycles called the city bike that you can borrow if you visit the city so if you come to the expo go straight to the danish pavilion get a danish bike and then continue visit the other pavilions but in copenhagen the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it so we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda images statements but no real experience so just like with a bike we don 't talk about it you can try it instead of talking about it we 're going to sail a so the chinese who have the courage can actually dive in and feel how clean it is but in fact and then they sail empty back so quite often you load water for ballast so we can actually hitch a and in the middle of this sort of harbor bath we 're actually going to put the actual little mermaid we 're going to invite a chinese artist to reinterpret her when you go to the exhibition you 'll see the mermaid and the pool you walk around start looking for a bicycle on the roof jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo so when we actually won the competition and to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the we will add on and then the chinese state said suggest change to panda so when it came out in denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument the national people 's party sort of rebelled against it they tried to pass a law against moving the mermaid so for the first time i got invited to speak at the national parliament and then at eleven o 'clock they stopped talking about these little issues and then from eleven to one they were debating whether or not to send the mermaid to china but to conclude if you want to see the mermaid from may to december next year don 't come to copenhagen because she 's going to be in shanghai you will probably see an installation by ai weiwei the chinese artist but if the chinese government intervenes it might even be a panda this is my apartment and they form this sort of the house is sort of a distortion of a square block trying to zigzag it to make sure that all of the onto this place where our client actually bought and we thought rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments looking straight into a big boring block of turn all the apartments into penthouses put them on a podium of cars and because copenhagen is completely flat if you want to have a nice south facing slope with a view you basically have to do it yourself then we sort of cut up the volume so we wouldn 't block the view from my apartment you have a single layer of apartments all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle like a a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view and a sort of dense urban location it product from switzerland because in switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators rasterized image to the project as the mountain we commissioned this japanese himalaya photographer to give us this beautiful photo of mount everest making the entire building a three thousand square meter artwork it 's almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors the wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades if you go even further it turns into this green garden and all the rainwater that drops on the mountain is actually accumulated and there is an automatic irrigation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens in one or two years sort of transform into a cambodian temple ruin completely covered in green the mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy and in this case actually offer people the chance that they don 't have to to choose between a life with a garden or a life in the city they can actually have both because that 's not really how you get commissions you always have to sort of adapt and improvise to the opportunities and accidents that happen and the sort of turmoil of the world one last example is that recently we like last summer we won the competition to design a nordic national bank this was the director of the bank when he was still smiling laughter unfortunately it was the national bank of iceland at the same time we actually had a visitor and he got very excited by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture because so he asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of azerbaijan so we took the commission and we made this small movie that i 'd like to show we quite often make little but in this case it was really easy to to choose the song and our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of azerbaijan and reinterpret them into inhabitable of human life then we place these mountains exploiting wind and to use the thermal properties of water and all the sort of excess gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green lush landscape so you can say where an urban development normally happens at the expense and the buildings they don 't only sort of so they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem"
