  "transcript": "and this may be a little bit of a surprise to i 've really tried to solve some some big problems and and i decided that i was going to set out to try to to solve this but this is actually a talk about okay but this is actually a talk about fission it 's about perfecting something old and bringing something old into the let 's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works in a nuclear power plant you have a big pot of water that 's under high pressure and you have some fuel rods and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium and they 're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel and that reaction heats up water the water turns to and you produce electricity from it this is the same way we 've been producing electricity the steam turbine idea for one hundred years is this the best way to do it is fission kind of played or is there something left to innovate here and so it 's not as big as but that 's a ton of that 's between and they 're trucked anywhere in the world you plop them down and they produce electricity this region right here is the i can 't and inside this reactor so anybody who 's a fan of thorium they 're going to be really excited about this happen to be really good at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle but i 'm not really concerned about the fuel you can run these off they 're really hungry they really like down blended weapons pits so that 's highly enriched uranium and weapons grade plutonium that 's been down blended it 's made into a grade where it 's not usable for a nuclear weapon and we have a lot of it sitting around because this is and that was great and and it has a heat exchanger and then that 's a heat exchanger to what makes this design really really interesting other than photovoltaic being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine turbine that 's actually not that efficient and in fact in a nuclear power plant like this it 's only roughly thirty to thirty five percent efficient that 's how much thermal and the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature they operate anywhere and this is called the brayton cycle this is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity and this makes this almost fifty percent efficient between forty five and fifty percent and i 'm really excited about this because but what 's what 's also great is you get a lot more electricity out for how much uranium you 're fissioning not to mention the fact that these burn up their burn up is much higher so for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor a lot more of it 's being used traditional nuclear power plant like this is so you have what 's called the xenon pit and so some of these fission products love neutrons they love the neutrons that are going on and which means that combined with the fact that the cladding doesn 't last very long you can only run one of these reactors for roughly say eighteen months without so these reactors run for thirty years without refueling which is because it means it 's a sealed system no refueling means but and i 'm really excited about this essentially two reasons and this means essentially in the event of an accident if you had any kind of breach of this stainless steel pressure vessel the coolant would leave the core these reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure so there 's no inclination for the fission but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances or you lost off site power in the case of something like fukushima there 's a dump tank because your fuel is and it 's combined with your coolant you could actually just drain the core into and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors fukushima and three mile island looking back at three mile island we didn 't really see this for a while these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods what happens is when they see high pressure water steam in an oxidizing environment they 'll actually produce hydrogen and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products so the core of this reactor since it 's not under pressure and it doesn 't have this chemical reactivity means that there 's no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor so even in the event of an accident the reactor may be toast which is you but we 're not going to contaminate large quantities of land so i i really think that in the say twenty years it 's going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality this could be the source of it 's an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change but it 's an innovation it 's a way to bring power to the developing world because it 's produced in a factory and it 's cheap you can put them anywhere in the world you want to i was was obsessed with nuclear science too to a point but but i think i get to come back to this because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that is the rocket designer 's dream that 's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet 's dream not only do you have fifty to one hundred megawatts to power whatever you want to but you have power once you get there you know rocket designers i mean a few watts or kilowatts wow that 's a lot of power i mean now we 're talking about one hundred megawatts that 's a ton of power that could power power a martian and so i hope that maybe i 'll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rocketry passion at the same time that i explore my nuclear passion and people say oh well you 've launched this thing and it 's radioactive into space and what about accidents but we launch plutonium batteries all the time everybody was really excited about curiosity and that had this big plutonium battery on board because you launch it cold and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor so i 'm really excited i think that i 've designed this reactor here that can and i 'm really prepared and i graduated high school in may and i decided that i was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that i 've developed these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes and i 'm really prepared to make this a reality and i think i think that looking at the technology this will be cheaper than cheaper than or the same price while it was converted to chemical energy in my food originally came from a nuclear reaction and so there 's something poetic about in my opinion perfecting so thank you guys"
