  "transcript": "it 's a feeling and it 's a reality and they 're different you could feel secure and you can be secure even if you don 't feel it really we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word and what i want to do in this talk is to split them apart figuring out when they diverge and how they converge so if you look at security from economic terms you 're always trading off something whether this is a personal decision whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home and the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer but whether it 's worth the but it 's not terribly relevant the question is was it worth it in terms of the trade off there 's often no right or wrong here some of us have a burglar alarm system at home and some of us don 't 'll depend on where we live whether we live alone or have a family how much cool stuff we have how much we 're willing to accept the risk of of theft there are different opinions trade offs are about more than just security and i think that 's really important people have a natural intuition about these last night in my hotel room when i decided to double lock the door or you in your car when you drove here when we go eat lunch and decide the food 's not poison and we 'll eat it trade offs again and again every species does it imagine a rabbit in a field eating grass and the rabbit sees a fox that rabbit will make a security trade off should i stay or should i flee and the rabbits that are bad at it so you 'd think that as a successful species on the planet you me everybody would be really good at making these trade offs yet it seems again and again that we 're hopelessly bad at it and i think that 's a fundamentally interesting question i 'll give you the short answer most of the time that works most of the time feeling and reality are the same certainly that 's true for most of human prehistory we 've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense one way to think of it is that we 're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the east african highlands in one hundred thousand bc two thousand and ten new york not so much now there are and you can see certain biases that come up again and again i 'll give you four we tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks so flying versus driving the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar one example would be people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports that kidnapping by relatives is much more common this is for children third personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks so bin laden is scarier because he has a so once you take up skydiving or smoking you downplay the risks if a risk is thrust upon you terrorism is a good example because you don 't feel like it 's in your control there are a bunch of other these cognitive biases that affect our risk decisions so you can imagine how that works if you hear a lot about tiger attacks there must be a lot of tigers around you don 't hear about lion attacks there aren 't a lot of lions around this works until you invent newspapers because what newspapers do is repeat again and again rare risks because by definition news is something that almost never happens laughter when something is so common it 's no longer news car crashes domestic violence those are the risks you worry about we we respond to stories more than data and there 's some basic innumeracy going on i mean so one half one quarter one fifth we 're good at that one in a million one in a billion they 're both almost never so we have trouble with the and what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality and the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack they get different or the other i write a lot about security theater which are products that make people feel secure but don 't actually do anything there 's maybe it 's what the cia is supposed to do for us if economics if the market drives security then the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives is to make people feel secure or two you can make people just feel secure and hope they don 't notice a couple of things understanding of the security of the risks the threats the countermeasures how they work but if you know stuff you 're more likely and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality security theater is exposed when it 's obvious that it 's not working properly a poor understanding if you don 't understand the risks you don 't understand the costs you 're likely to get the trade off wrong and your feeling doesn 't match it 's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter terrorist measures this is why you keep sacrificing virgins and why your unicorn defenses are working just great there aren 't enough examples of failures also feelings that cloud the issues i want to add a third element i want to add model feeling and model are in our head reality is the outside world it doesn 't change it 's real feeling is based on our intuition model is based on reason that 's basically the difference in a primitive and simple world there 's really no reason for a model you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face you need a model to understand them this model is an intelligent representation of reality it 's of course limited by it 's limited by our cognitive biases we get them from teachers elders a the tracker i was with grew up in kruger national park he had some very complex models of how i would have died in a day but he was born there and he understood how to survive i was born in new york city i could have taken him to new york and he would have died in a day laughter because we had different models based on our different experiences models can come from the media from our elected officials think of of models of terrorism child kidnapping id quite a lot of our computer security models come from there a lot of models come from science bird flu swine flu sars all of our feelings of security about those diseases so models can change models are not static as we become more comfortable in our environments there were a lot of fears about it there were people who were afraid to push doorbells because there was electricity in there and that was dangerous we 're very facile around electricity we change light bulbs without even thinking about it our model of of security around electricity it hasn 't changed as we were growing up and we 're good at it or think of the risks on the internet across generations how your parents approach internet versus how you do versus how our our kids will models eventually fade into the background you often don 't even know it 's there when swine flu first appeared the initial news caused a lot of overreaction and people thought doctors should be able to deal with it so there was that feeling of lack of control and those two things made the risk more than it was as the novelty wore off and the months went by there was some amount of there was no new data but there was less fear and there 's kind of a bifurcation people had to choose between fear and and acceptance there were a lot of people a surprising number who refused to get it and it sort of wildly with no new information with no new input this kind of thing happens a lot i have a very relativistic view of security i think it depends on the observer and most security decisions have a variety of people involved and stakeholders with specific and i call that their agenda and you see agenda this is marketing this is politics trying to convince you to have one model versus another trying to convince you to ignore a model and and marginalizing people with models you don 't like this is not uncommon an example a great example is the risk of smoking in the history of the past fifty years the smoking risk shows how a model changes and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn 't like compare that to the secondhand smoke debate probably about twenty years behind nowadays no kid will let you drive if you 're not wearing a seat belt compare that to the airbag debate probably about thirty years behind all examples of models changing what we learn is that changing models is hard you don 't even know you have a model where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs so evidence against our model we 're likely to ignore even if it 's compelling it has to get very compelling before we 'll pay attention new models that extend long periods of time are hard global warming is a great example we 're terrible at models that span eighty years we can do to the next just not good at we can have both models in our head simultaneously that kind of problem where we 're holding both beliefs strong feelings can create a model created a security model personal health scare a health scare in the news you 'll see these called flashbulb events by psychiatrists we don 't have experience we rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals i flew here yesterday i didn 't check the airplane we 're here but because we 're pretty sure the building codes here are good it 's a model we just accept what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models have it reflected in their feelings to allow them to make security the second more honest way change happens slowly the smoking debate took forty years and that was an easy one some of this stuff is hard really though information seems like our best hope might have for the first time in our species feeling chases model model chases reality reality 's moving they might never catch up we don 't know and i want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this it 's a horrific story someone took a bottle of tylenol someone else bought it and died this terrified people and this is how the tamper proof drug industry was invented that came from this it 's complete security theater as a homework assignment think of ten ways to get around it i 'll give you one a syringe last story a few years ago a friend of mine gave birth i visit her in the hospital it turns out so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward i wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals i go home i look it up it basically never happens you better have some good security theater or she 's going to rip your arm off laughter so it 's important for us those of us who design security who look at security policy or even look at public policy in ways that affect security what 's important we make better security"
