  "transcript": "and the problem i 'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy which is how can we know whether other people have minds and everyone else is just a really convincing robot 's a problem in philosophy but for today 's purposes and that i don 't have to worry about this there is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists which is why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes or perhaps more relevantly why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes novelists put this best like philip roth who said so ill equipped are we all to envision one another 's interior workings and invisible aims and that is the one i 'm going to introduce to you today and that problem is how is it so easy to know other minds so to start with an illustration you need almost no information one snapshot of a stranger to guess what this woman is thinking or what this man is and put another way the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds our brain is made up of pieces brain cells that we share with all other animals and what you get is the capacity to write romeo and juliet or to say as alan greenspan did but i 'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what i meant so i 'm going to tell you three things about this today obviously the whole project here is huge and i 'm going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about so first the first thing i want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain in your brains whose job it is to think about other people 's thoughts and this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures i showed you or when you read romeo and juliet or when you tried to understand alan greenspan so this brain region is called the right tpj and this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults they 're mit undergraduates laughter the second thing i want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other i 'm going to show you a little bit of that long extended process so i 'm going to show you a five year old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task rebecca saxe this is the first pirate his name is ivan and you know what pirates really like sandwiches and ivan puts his sandwich over here and ivan says you know what i need a drink with my lunch and so ivan goes to get a drink and while ivan is away the wind comes and here comes the other pirate this pirate is called joshua i love cheese sandwiches and he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest ivan comes back and he says i want my cheese sandwich so which one do you think ivan is going to take child i think he is going to take that one rs yeah you think he 's going to take that one all right let 's see oh yeah three year old who got the same puzzle ivan says i want my cheese sandwich which sandwich is he going to take do you let 's see what he does here comes ivan and he says i want my cheese sandwich and he takes this one where we would say he 's taking that one because he thinks it 's his so that 's why he 's taking the other sandwich so first i 'm going to show you the three year old again rs so is ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah five year old completely understood why ivan took joshua 's sandwich rs was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child and so it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich because the wind should get in trouble he says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches and now what we 've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what 's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about so the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region the right tpj being used while children are thinking about but it 's not quite like the adult brain so whereas in the adults as i told you this brain region is almost completely specialized it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people 's thoughts the age range of the children i just showed you and actually if we even look at eight to 11 year olds getting into early adolescence they still don 't have quite an people differ from one another in how good they so grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory and they take a break for coffee and grace 's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee grace goes to make the coffee but the powder is labeled deadly poison so grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison and she puts it in her friend 's coffee and her friend drinks the coffee and is fine how many people think it was morally permissible for grace to put the powder in but what 's different is what grace thinks now she thinks the powder is sugar people say she deserves no blame at all whereas if she thinks the powder was poison even though it 's really sugar now people say she deserves a lot of blame even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same the friend drank than in the other case where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred people though disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame grace should get in the accident case some people think she should deserve more blame people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief and we do have such a tool it 's called trans cranial magnetic stimulation or tms this is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody 's skull into a small region of their brain so i 'm going to show you a demo of this first i 'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse i 'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine when you hear clicks we 're turning the machine on so now i 'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain so there is no physical force just a magnetic pulse woman ready rebecca rs and we can use that same pulse and then we can apply tms to the rtpj and ask how people 's judgments change and the first thing is people can still do this task overall so their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same they say she deserves no blame people now say it was more okay she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee people say that it was less okay she deserves more blame so what i 've told you today is that people come actually especially well equipped to think about other people 's thoughts we have a special brain system but i want to give the last word back to the novelists and to philip who ended by saying the fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway it 's getting them wrong that is living getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then on careful reconsideration getting them wrong again magnetic pulses to change people 's moral judgments that sounds alarming please tell me that you 're not taking phone calls from the pentagon where this work leads i mean you 're clearly an incredible human being but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not torture chamber do acts that people here might be worried about rs we worry about this so there 's a couple of things to say about tms one is that you can 't be tmsed without knowing it 's not a surreptitious technology it 's quite hard actually to get those very small changes the changes i showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain but they 're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make and so i think of what i 'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial but studying the jury ca is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments rs that 's one of the idealistic hopes the whole research program here of studying the until recently what we knew about the brain were the things that and the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things learn language and abstract concepts and thinking about other people 's thoughts that 's brand new and we don 't know yet what the implications will be of understanding it ca so i 've got one last question the hard problem of consciousness that puzzles a lot of people the notion that you can understand why a brain works perhaps but why does anyone have to feel anything why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate you 're a brilliant young neuroscientist i chances do you think there are that at some time in your career someone you or someone else is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem rs i hope they do and i think they probably won 't ca why rs it 's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing"
