  "transcript": "and i have this picture up on my screen and a woman comes up behind me i could sense that she thought i was speaking synecdochically literally a few minutes before that i downloaded this scientific paper which is really quite interesting because it turns out you can model this you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum actually technically it 's not a rectum it 's called a cloaca at this point she stops me and she says who are you wha what do you do because i didn 't have any way to describe what i do and so in some sense this talk today is my answer to that it 's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that i do and it 's very hard for me to make sense of it so i 'm not sure that you can it 's the kind of thing that i sit up late at night thinking about sometimes often at four in the morning some people are afraid of what i do some people think i am the nerd tony soprano i 'm not sure what these people think because i don 't speak norsk one of the things that i love to because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations and see where they succeeded and where they failed use science to you know which is an incredibly beautiful place and an incredibly mysterious place because no matter where you go in easter island you 're struck by these statues called the moai basically these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of let 's cut down the last tree and commit suicide because we need more identical statues laughter and one thing that isn 't a mystery actually was when i grew up because when i was a little kid i 'd seen these pictures and i thought well there 's many mysteries these statues everyone wants to know how did they make them how did they transport them this woman in the foreground is jo anne van tilberg she 's the leading archaeologist and she has detailed records of every single statue the one on the page here is the same that 's up there one interesting problem is the stone isn 't very hard so this used to be completely smooth in fact but after one thousand years out in the weather they look like this jo anne and i have just embarked on a project to digitize them all going to do a very high res digitization first because it 's a way of preserving them second we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically then learn a few of the mysteries about them how long have they been standing in what positions and maybe indirectly get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are while i was in easter island comet mcnaught was there also so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet i also have an archaeological project going on in egypt going on is perhaps a little bit strong we 're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set to get it going so i 'll talk about it at a future ted but there 's some amazing opportunities in egypt as well i design nuclear reactors the red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors it 's called the open fuel cycle this is the normal way it 's done it 's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution it our reactor eliminates these steps which if we can actually make it work is a really cool thing now it 's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor there 's no reactor 's been even built to an old design much less a new one in the united states for it 's the kind of very high risk but potentially very high return thing that we do changing into a totally different field we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics particularly in an area called metamaterials a metamaterial is an artificial material which manipulates in this case electromagnetic radiation in a way that you couldn 't otherwise so this device here is an invisibility cloak it rays of light in this case microwave light come in and they just squish around the cell and they come back the other side now you could do that with mirrors from one angle the cool thing is this does it from all but metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field it 's you know today i 'd like to say it 's a zero billion dollar business but in fact it 's negative maybe it 's going to work we do a lot of work in biomedical working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries so they say the eyes are the windows of the soul turns out they 're a window to a whole lot more stuff and i 'm also very interested in cooking while i was at microsoft i took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in france i used to work also while at microsoft at a leading restaurant in seattle so i do a lot of cooking i 've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue but barbecue 's interesting because it 's one of these cult foods like chili or bouillabaisse various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to there 's tremendous and that 's because it is but if you get to play with all those knobs and dials and of course really the controller over there does it all on software you can make some terrific ribs you should all have one in your kitchen beside your turbochef this subjects food to a force about fifty thousand times that of normal normal gravity and oh boy does it clarify chicken stock you would not believe it i perform a series of ghoulish experiments on on food trying to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking times are theory is red black is experiment so i 'm either really good at faking it or this particular model seems to work and you may be familiar and jill has which is kind of cool she is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years may not ever so i like to support people that are risking their lives after the movie came out of course there was a lot of interest in seti the seti institute with a little bit of help from me and a lot of help from paul allen and a variety of other people is building a dedicated radio telescope in hat creek california so they can do this seti work now i travel a lot and i change cell phones a lot and the one person who always gets updated on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else is jill because i really don 't want to miss so i do a lot of work on dinosaurs to find dinosaurs you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur it sounds really dumb but that 's what it is it 's horrible conditions because wherever you have plants grow and you don 't get any erosion and you don 't see any dinosaurs so you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring you paleontologists pray for erosion so you hike around you hike around you see something like this now this is something i found so look at it very closely here you 've got this which is sort of swells up and expands and there 's some stuff poking out so you look at that and you look up close and you say well gee that 's kind of interesting what are all of these pieces well if you look closely and then when you look at this you say that 's a tooth it 's a big tooth it 's about the size of a banana this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground and this is what it 's like to find a tyrannosaurus rex which i was lucky enough to do a few years ago this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room which i had bought and then after buying the cast i found my own and i don 't have room for two you the thing that 's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual it 's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways the study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there 's a problem with asteroid impact for example the study of dinosaurs may literally one day save the planet study of the ancient climate is very important in fact the mesozoic when dinosaurs lived had much higher co2 than today was much warmer than today and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of on climate this is actually what most dinosaur research looks like this is one of my papers a pygostyle from a non avian theropod it 's not as gripping as dinosaur sex so we 're not going to go into it further i travel all over the world taking pictures unfortunately that means you 've got to spend more time sorting through them here 's a picture i took in the falkland islands of king penguins on a beach here 's a picture i took in alaska a few years ago of orcas and we hadn 't seen a damn orca and the last day the sun comes out the orcas come they 're right by the boat it 's fantastic and i get lots of pictures like this to a human audience i need to explain that if penthouse magazine had a marine mammal there 's more and more activity near the boat and all of a sudden somebody shouts what 's that in the water i said i think that 's what you call a free willy there 's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have the first thing you learn is the overwhelming importance of hands they don 't have them and he has he may not realize it but he wrote a song all about whale sex that 's kind of what it 's like the other interesting thing that i learned about about whale sex they curl their toes too so where do you and i 've never been able to do focus passion on something but then there will be something else and then there 's something else again and for a long time i fought this and i thought well gee i really ought to buckle down and the whole industry was expanding so much that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life but ultimately i decided that what i really ought to do is not fight being who i am i this whole talk has been but that 's really what works for me and regardless of whether it 's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex the common or lowest common denominator is me"
