  "transcript": "alexander graham bell famously said on his first successful telephone call hello is that domino 's pizza long trip and he you are viewing my upper half my lower half is appearing at a different conference turns out be in two places at once but still i 'm sorry i can 't be with you in person i 'll explain at another time and though i 'm a rock star i just want to assure you that none of my wishes but what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on this revolution is much bigger than that i hope i believe what turns me on about the digital age what excites me personally is that you have closed the gap between dreaming you needed a studio and a producer if you wanted to make a film you needed a mass of you need a camera that fits in your palm and a couple of bucks for a blank dvd imagination and that really really excites me i 'm excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking writ large what i would like to see is idealism decoupled idealism decoupled from all constraints political economic from the ease with which you swept away obstacles and that 's actually what i 'd like to talk about today it 's a journey that started do they know it 's christmas band aid live aid another very tall grizzled rock star my friend sir bob geldof issued a challenge to feed the world and it utterly changed my life and myself went to ethiopia we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on we lived in ethiopia for a month working at an orphanage the children had a name for me they called me the girl with the beard anybody who ever gave anything to africa got a lot more back ethiopia didn 't just anyway on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his would you take it was the middle of that awful famine and but i turned him down and it 's a feeling i can 't ever quite forget i started this journey i became the worst thing of all i became a rock star with a cause is it thousand africans dying every single day from aids a preventable treatable disease for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy that 's not a cause eleven million aids orphans in africa twenty million by the end of the decade that 's not a cause that today every day nine thousand more africans will catch hiv because of so what we 're talking about here is the right to live like a human the right to live period and what we 're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity this is about justice and that 's too bad because even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford we like to give and we give a lot look at the response to the tsunami but justice you see it makes a farce of our idea of equality it mocks our pieties it doubts our concern it questions our commitment because there is no way we can look at what 's happening in africa and if we 're honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else not in europe in fact a head of state that you 're all familiar with admitted this to me and it 's really true there is no chance africa is a continent we would all do more to put the fire out we 're standing around with watering cans when you see it 's not as dramatic as the tsunami it 's crazy really when you think about it does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain the slow extinguishing catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert funny that anyway i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual people dying a day in africa may be africa 's crisis but the fact that it 's not on the nightly news that we in europe or you in america are not treating it like an emergency i want to argue that though africa is not the front line it could be soon every week extremists take another african village they 're attempting to bring order to chaos well why aren isn 't it cheaper and smarter to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later the war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty and i didn 't say that colin powell said that now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone maybe we should listen there 's an opportunity here and it 's real it 's not spin it 's not wishful thinking the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re describe ourselves we will not only transform other people 's lives but we will also transform the way those other lives see us and that might be smart don 't you think that on a purely commercial level and let 's cut the brand eu brand usa the neon sign is fizzing and cracking never before have we in the west been so scrutinized our values do we have any our credibility brand usa could use some polishing and i say that as a fan you know more or ought to be but equality for africa the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference what on earth can we all do about this and because we can we must this is the straight the righteous truth it is not a theory the fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye we do not have to stand for this a whole continent written off we do not have to stand for this let me say this without a trace of irony before i back it up to a bunch of ex hippies forget the ' 60s but we but working together we can turn and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us i 'm sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in haight ashbury in but i want to argue that this is the moment headier ideas that you gestated in your youth this is what excites me this room most of you started out wanting to change the world didn 't you well now actually because of you it is possible to change the they know much more than i do so why then are we not pumping our fists into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it we 've got to do something about it it is a pain in the arse this equality business is actually a pain in the arse we have the life saving drugs but i and i do not have flowers in my hair actually i come from punk rock the clash wore big army boots not sandals but i know toughness when i see it and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast there was muscle you see idealism detached from action is but idealism allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit and it 's very present in a crowd like you this organization i helped set up we launched a campaign to summon this spirit it 's based on our belief but the actions of many coming together as one can change we feel that now is the time to prove we 're right there are moments in history we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in africa is just no longer acceptable this could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live this year is a test for us all especially the the leaders of the g8 nations who really are on the line here with all the world in history watching i have been of late disappointed with the bush administration they made some really great promises and actually have fulfilled a lot of them but some of them they haven 't they don 't feel the push from the ground is the truth but my disappointment has much more perspective when i talk to american but there 's much more push from the ground than you 'd think if we got organized what i try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it the investment reaps huge returns not only in lives saved but in goodwill stability and security that we 'll gain and not have it deducted from my what i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians if you like to spend their political capital and your financial capital national purse on saving the lives of millions of people that 's really what what i would like you to do because we also need your intellectual capital your ideas your skills your ingenuity and you at this conference are in a unique position some of the we 've been talking about you invented them or at least revolutionized the way that they 're used together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital and pushed pushed the boundaries and we 'd like you to as i say there 're two things on the line here there 's the but there 's also our sense of ourselves ngos mothers ' unions student unions a lot of people are getting together and working under this umbrella i told you about earlier the one campaign i think they just have one idea in their mind which is where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world history like god is watching what we do when the history books i think our age will be remembered for three things really it 's just three things and what we did some say we can 't afford to you see if this is true and i believe it is the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination this should be a piece of piss most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them i wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million american activists for africa is my first wish i believe it 's possible a few minutes ago i talked about ' campaigns that are springing up you know there 's lots out there and with this one campaign as our umbrella my organization data and other groups have been tapping into the energy and and the enthusiasm that 's out there from hollywood into the heartland of america we know there 's more than enough energy to power this movement we just need your help we can 't afford to be cool and sit this one out i do believe if we build a movement that 's one million americans we 're not going to be denied we will have the ear of congress we 'll be the first page in condi rice 's briefing book and right into the oval office if there 's one million americans and i really know this i am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course anyway so i 'd like your help in getting that signed up i know john gage and sun microsystems are already on board for this but there 's lots of you we 'd like to talk to right my second wish number two would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day that 's one billion media hits could be on google could be on aol steve case produced by jon we need to get the statistics out to the american people i really believe that old truman line that if you give the american people the facts they 'll do the right thing and the other thing that 's important is that this is not sally struthers this has to be described as an adventure not a burden one more acting as one we can beat extreme poverty starvation aids but we need your help one more person letter voice will mean the difference between life please join us by working together we can start to make poverty history please visit one at this address we 're not asking for your money we 're asking for your voice show the power of information its power to health clinic and school i believe we can connect every school in ethiopia every health clinic every hospital we can connect and that would be a it 's actually where it all which changed all of our lives can transform a country and a continent that has hardly made it to analog let alone digital but it didn 't start out that way the first on the phone it was just nine years later that addis ababa since then not that much has changed the average waiting time to get a landline in ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years but wireless technology wasn 't dreamt up i 'm irish and as you can see i know how important talking is nurses getting better training pharmacists being able to order supplies it 's a very very good idea and that is my third and final wish for you at the ted conference thank you very much once again"
