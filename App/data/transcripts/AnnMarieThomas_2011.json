  "transcript": "she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands so my wonderful student sam and and i decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of play doh and so we spent a summer play dough pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen we have two favorite recipes one that has these ingredients and they 're great we can make great little sculptures with these these but the really cool thing about them is when we put them together well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits circuits that the most creative tiny little hands can build on their own applause so i want to do a little demo for you so if i take this salt dough again it 's like the play dough you probably made as kids and i plug it in 's a two lead battery pack simple battery pack you can buy them at radio shack and pretty much anywhere else we can actually then light things up but if any of you have studied electrical engineering we can also create a short circuit if i push these together the light turns off right the current wants to run through the play dough not through that led if i separate them again but if i stick that light back in i have light in fact i could even add some movement to my sculptures if i want a spinning tail let 's grab a motor put some play dough on it stick it on and we have spinning i plug in again the power to it and now i can start talking about parallel and series circuits i can start plugging in lots of lights and we can start talking about things like electrical load what happens if i put in lots we can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we 've done you could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this so this is all in your home actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab we have a website it 's all there these are the home recipes we 've got some videos you can make them yourselves and it 's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers but maybe we should have fun thank you"
