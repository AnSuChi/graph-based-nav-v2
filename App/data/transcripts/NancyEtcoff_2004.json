  "transcript": "a feeling the pursuit of happiness and human design i put up a somewhat dour darwin but a very happy chimp up there my man wishes to be happy only wishes to be happy and cannot wish not to be so we are wired to pursue happiness not only to enjoy it but to want more and more of it so given that that 's true how good are we at well we certainly try the nine choices the ten secrets now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug it was clean efficient there was no high there was really no danger it had no street value in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five illegal drugs were a $ four hundred billion business representing eight percent of world trade roughly the same as gas and oil happiness haven 't really increased happiness very much one problem that 's happening now is although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon depression and anxiety are rising some people say this is because we have better diagnosis and more people are being found out it isn 't just that we 're seeing it all over the world there is a rash of suicide in china and now the good news here is that if you take surveys the field of psychology hasn 't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness in part we have the legacy of freud who was a pessimist who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual that can never be met in one feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation so the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what freud called ordinary misery laughter and freud in part reflects the the anatomy of the human emotion system which is that we have both a and our negative system is extremely sensitive we also find that people are more averse to losing than they are happy to gain the formula for a happy marriage is five positive remarks or interactions for every one negative and that 's how powerful the one negative is especially expressions of contempt or disgust well you really need a lot of positives to upset that really there for physical danger and so over time this becomes a stress response which has enormous effects on the body cortisol floods the brain it destroys hippocampal cells and memory and can lead to all kinds of health problems we need this system in part if we were only governed by pleasure we would not survive we really have two command posts emotions are short lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity and each one of them allows us to click into alternate what kind of decisions we make so let me go forward to the new science of happiness we 've come away from the freudian gloom and people are now actively studying this and one of the key points in the science of happiness is that happiness and unhappiness are not endpoints of a single continuum the freudian model is really one continuum that as you get less miserable you get happier and that isn 't true when you get less miserable you get less miserable and it 's been missing it 's been missing from psychotherapy so when people 's symptoms go away they tend to recur because there isn 't a sense of the other half of what pleasure happiness compassion gratitude what are the positive emotions and of course we know this intuitively that happiness is not just the absence but somehow it was not put forward until very recently seeing these as two parallel systems so that the body can both look for opportunity and also protect itself from danger at the same time and they 're sort of two reciprocal and dynamically interacting systems and then three emotions for which there are no english words fiero which is which is happiness in another 's misfortune a malicious pleasure is a pride and joy in one 's children absent from this list and absent from any discussions of happiness are happiness in another 's happiness we don 't seem to have a word for that babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures there was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that eighty percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes and it 's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller there is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes about fifty percent but there is still that fifty percent that is unaccounted for let the prefrontal cortex orbital frontal cortex where decisions are made high level this was originally seen as a system that was the pleasure system of the brain olds and milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat and the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times it wouldn 't eat it wouldn 't sleep it wouldn 't have sex it wouldn 't do anything but press this bar so they assumed it turned out that it wasn 't that it really is a system of motivation a system of wanting that 's something different from the system that is the pleasure system which simply says the pleasure system as you see which the other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal and the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major it 's also crinkling the outer corner of the extroverts use it more than introverts you will look for this expression our pleasures are really ancient and we learn of course many many pleasures but many of them are base of course is biophilia that we have a response to the natural world that 's very profound very interesting studies done on people recovering from surgery who found that people who faced a brick wall 's part of how we are tuned humans particularly so we 're very imitative creatures and we imitate from almost the second we are born here is a three week old baby and if you stick your tongue out at this baby the baby will do the same we are social beings from the beginning and even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain looking at this intersubjectivity or the importance of the social brain to humans who come into the world helpless and need each other tremendously is that they focus instead on the self and hasn 't made us any happier at all because when you think about it people are happiest when in flow whatever they 're not sitting in front of the mirror trying to figure themselves out the other thing is that a piece of evidence is is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide what you the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone and being alone is is very unnatural to the human but there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up because for example the genes don 't care whether we 're happy they care that we replicate that we pass our genes on so for example we have three there 's lust which is just romantic attraction that gets into the desire system and that 's dopamine fed and that 's i must have this one person there 's attachment which is oxytocin and the opiates which says we are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it now in the animal world and i keep it by beating my chest and you make submissive gestures now the human has a whole other way to rise to the top and that is a prestige route which is freely conferred someone has expertise and knowledge and knows how to do things and we give that person status and that 's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status so that people don 't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world but it 's not irrelevant so if you look at questions like this life satisfaction you see life satisfaction going up with each and one of the problems with money is materialism what happens when people pursue money so we have here this couple do you think the less fortunate are having better sex and then this kid over here is saying leave me alone with my toys so one of the things is that it really takes over that whole system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system maslow had this idea back in the 1950s that as people rise above their biological needs as the world becomes safer and we don 't have to worry about basic needs being met our biological system whatever motivates us is being satisfied we can rise above them to think beyond ourselves toward or transcendence and rise above the materialist so to just quickly conclude with some brief data that suggests this might be so but very similarly the only one that survived there was happiness they went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self control to generosity and forgiveness i end with a few quotes there is only one question how to love this world and rilke if your daily life seems poor do not blame it blame yourself tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches first say to yourself what you would be then do what you have to do"
