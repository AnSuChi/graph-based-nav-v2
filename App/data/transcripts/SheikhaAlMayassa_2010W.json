  "transcript": "which pat said makes seventy percent but according to our statistics it makes sixty percent of the region 's population qatar is no exception to the region it 's a very young nation led by young people we have been it 's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear now i remember a few years ago president of qatar university who by the way is a woman he asked her whether she thought the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way instead she felt more free more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya she could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care not that you do we know that modernization is happening and yes qatar wants to be a modern nation but at the same time we are reconnecting and reasserting our arab heritage and we continuously make the conscious research has shown that the more the world is flat if i use tom friedman 's analogy or global which is why i prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the we 're trying to be part of this global village but at the same time we 're revising and i think a lot of people in this room i can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself and i 'm sure although we can 't see the people in washington they are in the same position we 're continuously trying to straddle different worlds different cultures and trying to meet the challenges of a different expectation from ourselves so i want to ask a question what should culture in the 21st century look like in a time where the world is becoming personalized when the mobile phone the burger the telephone everything has its own personal identity how should we perceive ourselves how does that impact our desert culture cultural developments happening in the region and the more recent museum of islamic art opened in qatar in two thousand and eight we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions and guess what you might be surprised to know that most people in the gulf who are leading leading these cultural initiatives happen to be women i want to ask you why do you think this is is it because it 's a soft option we have nothing else to do no i don 't think so i think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally it 's a natural component for bringing people together discussing ideas in the same way we 're doing here at ted we 're sharing out ideas and discussing them art becomes a very important part of our national identity the existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation 's development of cultural identity is very important ask me ask the chairpersons and ceos of sotheby 's and christie 's ask charles saatchi about great art they make a lot of money so i think women in our society are becoming leaders because they realize that and why is there an uproar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum why does it take me months months on end to get an export license from london or new york in order to get pieces into my country in few hours shirin neshat my friend from iran who 's a very important artist for us will be talking to you she lives in new york city but she doesn 't instead she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture nation and heritage she does that through important visual forms of photography and film we don 't want to have what there is in the west we don 't want their collections we want to build our own identities our own fabric create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us and arabs who are not muslims not all arabs are muslims by the way but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution this institution is is and it has been the case for the past three decades we will open the museum in a few days and i welcome all of you to get on qatar airways and come and join us some of you might have heard of the algerian artist baya mahieddine but i doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in picasso 's studio in paris in the now visual expression is just one form of of culture integration we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of youtube and social networking to express their stories share their last year we didn 't have one qatari woman filmmaker today i am proud to say we have trained and educated over sixty six qatari women filmmakers to edit tell their own stories in their own voices now if you 'll allow me i would love to share a one minute film that has proven to show that a 60 sec film can be as powerful and this is one of our filmmakers ' products the last month we had our second doha tribeca film festival here in doha the doha tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub katara it attracted forty two thousand they 're learning our culture our language our heritage and realizing we now over and over again people have said let 's build bridges and frankly i want to do more than that i would like break the walls of ignorance between but rather the soft power that joseph nye has spoken about before bring people together we should not underestimate it know thyself that is the journey of but i know that me as an individual and we as a nation welcome this community of ideas worth spreading very interesting journey i familiarity destroys and trumps fear try it ladies and gentlemen thank you very much shokran"
