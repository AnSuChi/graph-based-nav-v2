  "transcript": "you had to register it with the government and this was done so the government could track where the text was coming from if they found a paper and we in the west couldn 't understand in two thousand and eleven if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer this is happening to us and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it and this is an example of the ways our own governments are using technology we have three main groups we have online criminals like here we have and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand these guys make money they use online attacks to make lots of money and lots and lots of it we actually have several cases of millionaires online and so on and so on these guys make their fortunes online but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer and that bank account had fourteen point nine million us dollars in it when it was frozen mr jain himself is on the loose nobody knows where he is and i claim it 's already today that it 's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than that this is only going to get worse in the future the majority of crime will be happening the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money they 're motivated by something else motivated by protests motivated by an opinion groups like anonymous have risen up over the last twelve months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks so those are the three main attackers but then the last group are nation states governments doing the attacks this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens is a certificate authority from the netherlands or actually it was it was running into bankruptcy last and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the diginotar hack and his answer was yes so how do people die as the result of a hack like this well diginotar is a ca they sell ssl encrypted services services like now we all or a big part of us use gmail or one of their competitors but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections so the local government can 't snoop and this is exactly what happened with the case of diginotar what about arab arab spring and things that have been happening for example in egypt well and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers among those papers was this binder and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold to the egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting at a very large scale all the communication of the citizens of the country they had sold this tool for two hundred and eighty thousand euros to the egyptian government the company headquarters are right just a couple of weeks ago the if you are a suspect in a criminal case well it 's pretty obvious your phone will be tapped but today it goes beyond that they will tap your internet connection they will even use tools like state trojan to infect your computer with a trojan which enables them to watch all your communication to listen to your online discussions to collect your passwords and this is an in two thousand and eleven"
