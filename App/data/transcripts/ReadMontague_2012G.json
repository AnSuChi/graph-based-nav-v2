  "transcript": "and provide the early stages embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact but before i do that let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible the first is we can now eavesdrop safely on healthy brain activity ' brains while they do a variety of cognitive tasks and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging so we 've all heard of grayscale images that are frozen in time and in that mode you could make microscopic blood flow movies from hundreds the things that make your brain work the things that make your software work in your brain are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow you make a blood flow movie you have an independent proxy of brain activity this has literally revolutionized cognitive science take any cognitive domain you want memory motor planning thinking about your emotional response it goes on and on put people into functional mri devices and it 's opened us up to a new experimental preparation neurobiologists as you well know have lots of experimental preps worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this and now we have a new experimental prep let me give you one example and it 's in the area of what you 'd call valuation valuation is just what you think it is you know if you went and you were valuing two companies against one another you 'd want to know which was more valuable cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago if you want to compare oranges to windshields what do you do well you can 't compare oranges to windshields and value them accordingly well and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system whose cells are located in your brainstem and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain and we know a good bit about that now and they make you value that over everything else here 's the key feature though these neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas and i put some symbols up here that we assign value to for various reasons and it at least in part involves dopamine we can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea for a mere idea no other species can do that in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the cult heaven 's gate committed mass suicide predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship hale bopp waiting to take them to the next level it was but the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival that 's a lot of control one thing that i 've left out of this narrative is the obvious thing which is the focus of the so this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs that makes you freeze when you get parkinson 's disease that contributes to various forms of psychosis is also redeployed to value interactions with other people and to assign value to gestures that you do when you 're interacting with let me give you an example of this you bring to the table such enormous processing power in this domain that you hardly even notice it let me just give you a few examples so here 's a baby she 's three months old she still poops in her diapers and she can 't do calculus i see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other here 's a couple they 're sharing a moment together but and i 'm thinking i 'm not seeing love and admiration on the left and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face he 'll kill me for showing it engages deep systems in our brain in dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex food and salt they keep you alive it gives them the pie it gives that kind of a behavioral punch which we 've called a superpower so how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe and the short answer is games so what we do is we go into two areas and we contrive them to our own purposes so this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer a split to blue and offers blue thirty so he offers a 70 30 split with blue control passes to blue and blue says so you should take all non zero offers what do people do people are indifferent at an 80 20 split at 80 20 it 's a coin flip whether you accept that or not why is that you know because you 're pissed off you 're mad that 's an unfair offer and you know what an unfair that just gives you an example of the kind of thing that that you have to be able to remember what you 've done you have to stand up in the moment to do that then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back and you have to do something that you sit across the desk from somebody they have some prior image of you you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place place where you want it to be we in doing this what we 've discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines when methane built up or carbon dioxide built up or oxygen was diminished the birds would swoon before people would so it acted as an early warning system hey get out of the mine things aren 't going so well and they and there 's just numbers going back and forth between the people and they bring enormous sensitivities to it so we realized we could exploit this and in fact as we 've done that and we 've done this now in many thousands of people i think on the order of we actually to make this a biological probe need bigger numbers than that remarkably so and we 've been able to take those patterns convert them into mathematical models and we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior here 's the cool thing and we built software that 'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices up over the internet we synchronize the machines set them these staged social interactions and we eavesdrop on both of the interacting brains so for the first time we don 't have to look at just averages over single individuals or have individuals playing computers or try to make inferences that way we can study individual dyads we can study the way that one person interacts with another person turn the numbers up and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses or brain damage into these social interactions and use these as probes of that but it 's our way of going in and redefining with a new lexicon as opposed to characterizing these diseases by using the people or and it gives us a kind of assay of this here are a few of our collaborating sites the hub ironically enough is centered in little roanoke virginia there 's another hub in london now and the rest are getting set up that 's a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world but we 're also studying just a small part of what makes us interesting as human beings and so i would invite other people who are interested in this to ask us for the software or even for guidance on how to move forward with that to gain new insights into"
