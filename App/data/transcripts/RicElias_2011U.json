  "transcript": "imagine an engine going clack so i looked at them right away and they said no problem we probably hit some birds the pilot had already turned the plane around and we weren 't that far you could see manhattan two minutes later three things happened at the same time the pilot lines up the plane with the hudson river 's usually not the route he says brace for impact i didn 't have to talk to the flight attendant now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day i learned that it all changes in an instant and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn 't all the fences i wanted to mend all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did as i thought about that later on i came up with a saying which is i collect bad wines because if the wine is ready and the person is there i 'm opening it and that urgency that purpose has really changed my life the second thing i learned that day and this is as we clear the george washington bridge which was by not a lot i 've lived a good life in my own humanity and mistakes i 've tried to get better at everything i tried but in my humanity i also allow my ego to get in and i regretted the time i wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter and i thought about my relationship with my wife with my friends with people and after as i reflected on that i decided to eliminate negative energy from my life it 's i choose to be happy the third thing i learned and this is as your mental clock starts going dying is not scary it 's almost like we 've been preparing for it our whole lives but it was very sad and that sadness really framed in one thought which is i only wish for one thing i only wish i could see my kids grow up about a month later i was at a performance by my daughter i realized at that point by connecting those two dots that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad above all above all the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad i was given another gift which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live imagine the same thing happens on your plane and please don 't what would you get done that you 're waiting to get done because you think you 'll be here forever how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them and more than anything being the best parent you can thank you"
