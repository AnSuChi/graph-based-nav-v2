  "transcript": "talk about a very fundamental change that is going on and to talk about that i 'm going to go back to the beginning because in the beginning were commodities commodities are things that you grow in the ground raise on the ground or pull out of the ground basically animal mineral where we used commodities as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy well what then happened over the last fifty or sixty years is that goods have become commoditized commoditized where they 're treated like a commodity where people don 't care who makes them my first book was called came up a couple of times yesterday and how i discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good because it was done just for a particular person because it wasn 't inventoried it was delivered on demand to that individual person so we moved from an industrial economy to a service based economy but over the past ten or twenty years what 's happened is that services are being commoditized as well and even the internet is commoditizing not just goods but services as well what that means is that it 's time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the services and use in that same heuristic what happens when you customize a service what happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person that 's exactly what they need at this moment in time then you can 't help but make them go you can 't help but turn it into a memorable event you can 't help but turn it into an experience now most places that i talk to when i talk about experience i talk about disney the world 's premier experience stager i talk about theme restaurants and experiential retail and boutique hotels and las vegas the experience capital of the world but here when you think about experiences think about thomas dolby and his group playing music think about meaningful places think about drinking wine about a journey to the clock of the long now those are all experiences think about ted itself the experience capital in the world of of conferences now over the last several years i spent a lot of time in europe and particularly in the netherlands and whenever i talk about the experience economy there i 'm always greeted at the end with one particular question and the dutch when they usually put it it always starts with the same two words you know the words i mean we like real natural authentic experiences i point out that first of all you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience why because the experience happens inside of us it 's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us so as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings then every experience we have is authentic now and there 's no such thing as a one hundred percent there is a company that manufactured the car there 's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods right all of those are and then i always is that the netherlands is every bit as manufactured as disneyland laughter and the dutch they always go there isn 't a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasn 't been reclaimed from the sea or otherwise moved modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there it 's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up but nonetheless not just the dutch but everyone has this desire for the authentic and authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility the buying criteria by which consumers are choosing who are they going to buy from and what they 're going to buy becoming the basis of getting the commodities to market with the industrial economy it is about controlling costs getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses with the service economy it it 's about rendering rendering authenticity and the keyword is rendering right because there is a basic but no business can supply one and all those things make something so how do you render authenticity is the question are you rendering authenticity when you think about that let me go back to what lionel trilling in his seminal book on authenticity sincerity and authenticity came out in one thousand nine hundred and sixty points to as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the lexicon if you will and that is to no surprise in shakespeare and there is one part in this play hamlet where the most fake of all the characters in hamlet polonius says something profoundly real at the end of a laundry list of advice he 's giving to his son laertes he says this and it doth follow as night the day that thou canst not then be false to any man there are two you think about that you do in fact get a two by two where on one dimension it 's a matter of being true to if not you have is not true to itself and is not what it says it is yielding a two by two matrix and of course if you are both true to yourself and are what you say you are then you 're real real the opposite of course is fake fake if you do like it it 's faux now the other two sides of the a real fake is true to itself but not what it says it is you can contrast them by thinking about universal city walk versus disney world or disneyland universal city walk is a real fake in fact we got this very term from ada louise huxtable 's book america a wonderful book where she talks about universal city walk as you know she decries the fake but she says at least that 's a real fake right because you can see behind the facade it 's in the city of los angeles you 're going to walk a lot right you don 't tend to walk a lot in los angeles well here 's a place where you are going to walk a lot outside in this city but is it really true to itself is it really in the city is it disney world on the other hand is a fake real or a fake reality right it 's not what it says it is it 's not really the magic kingdom but it is oh i 'm sorry i didn 't mean to we won 't talk about santa claus then right just wonderfully true to itself when you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment now the easiest way right the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business knowing where your heritage is what you have done in the past and what you have done in the past limits what you can do what you can get away with essentially in the future so you have to understand that past think about disney again disney ten or fifteen years ago right the disney the company that is probably best known for family values out there disney bought the abc network the abc network affectionately known in the trade as the t & a network right that 's not too much jargon is it right the t & a network then it bought miramax known for its because it is no longer true to itself so when it comes to being what you say you are the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not that 's when you 're perceived as fake as a phony company advertizing things that you 're not think about any hotel any airline any you 'd have a great experience but unfortunately you have to experience the actual hotel airline and hospital and then you have that disconnect then you have that perception that you are phony so the number one for people to experience who you are right it 's not advertising does it that 's why you have companies like starbucks right that doesn 't advertise at all they said you want to know who we right coffee at its core is what you know how much coffee is worth when treated as a commodity as a bean two or three cents per cup and now it 'll and now because of that authentic experience you can charge five dollars for a cup of coffee so authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility"
