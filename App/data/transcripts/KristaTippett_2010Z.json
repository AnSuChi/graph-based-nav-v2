  "transcript": "has a problem as essential as it is across our traditions as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives is hollowed out in our culture and it is suspect in my field of journalism it 's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing karen armstrong has told what i think is an iconic story of giving a speech in holland and after the fact the word compassion was translated as pity now compassion when it enters the news too often comes in the form of pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic and so what i 'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is and i hope you 'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter that they shape the way we understand ourselves the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others when this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that now the word look at it in the dictionary connotes allowing indulging and enduring and it 's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough and the going is pretty rough right now i think that without perhaps being able to name it we are collectively experiencing that we 've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue compassion is a worthy successor it is organic across our religious spiritual and ethical traditions and yet it transcends them so what is it three dimensionally what are its kindred and component parts what 's in its universe of attendant virtues to start simply i want to say that compassion is kind now kindness might sound like a very mild word and it 's prone to its own abundant compassion is also i love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in los angeles aziza hasan and malka fenyvesi they are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young jews and muslims and as they do that they cultivate what they call curiosity without assumptions well that 's going to be a breeding can be synonymous with empathy it can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence it 's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there just showing up i think that compassion also is often linked to beauty i love it that my muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value and in that light for the religious compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery encouraging us not just to see beauty but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering in the face of a stranger in the face of the vibrant religious other but i can show you what compassion looks like because it is visible when we see it we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable what is possible it is so important when we 're communicating big ideas but especially a a big spiritual idea like compassion to root it as we present it to others and compassion and i don 't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him but he 's paraplegic he 's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was thirteen in a car crash that killed his father and his sister matthew 's legs don 't work and he 'll never walk again and and he does experience this as an and illness and aging he says that he 's just at an an extreme end of the spectrum we 're all on he 's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from iraq and afghanistan but he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body becoming more compassionate towards all of life compassion also looks like this this is jean vanier helped found the l 'arche communities which you can now find all over the world communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities mostly down syndrome the communities that jean vanier founded like jean vanier himself exude tenderness tender is another word i would love to spend some time resurrecting we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive a lot of time being those things too and compassion can also have those qualities jean vanier says that his work like the work of other people his great beloved late friend mother teresa is never in the first instance about changing the world it 's in the first instance about changing he 's says that what they do with l 'arche is not but a sign and compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories never by statistics and strategies and at the same time that we are doing that i think we are rediscovering the power of story that as human beings we need stories to survive to flourish to change our traditions have always known this and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us there is of course a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of judaism to repair the world tikkun olam and i 'll never forget hearing that story from dr rachel naomi remen who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her that in the beginning of the creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces it lodged as shards inside every aspect of the creation and that the highest human calling is to look for this light to point at it when we see it to gather it up and in so doing to repair the world now this might sound like a fanciful tale some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way rachel naomi remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time frail and flawed as we may be inadequate as we may feel has exactly what 's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch stories like like this are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us rachel naomi remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors this trend of what rachel naomi remen is doing how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine the work fred luskin is doing i think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century that science in fact is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism this is going to change but here 's a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion = mc2 we don 't hear so much about the einstein who invited the african american opera singer marian anderson to stay in his home when she came to sing in princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn 't have her we don 't hear about the einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in europe or the scottsboro boys in the american south but he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early he once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three year old we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time he liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages and einstein said and i think this is a quote again that has not been passed down in his legacy that these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living more necessary to the dignity security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge now invoking einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us but actually it is i want to show you the rest of this photograph because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word compassion in our culture we clean it up and we diminish so in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral it 's not this is the full photograph and you see a middle aged man wearing a leather jacket smoking a cigar we put these two photographs side by side on our website and someone said when i look at the first photo i ask myself what was he thinking and when i look at the second i ask what kind of person was he what kind of man is this well he was complicated and it is much harder often to be compassionate towards those closest to us which is another quality in the so was mother teresa so are we all and i want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion following on what fred luskin says that these flaws just make us human but what a liberating thing to realize that our problems in fact are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others rachel naomi remen is a better doctor because of her life long struggle with crohn 's disease einstein but because he was a jew as germany grew fascist and karen armstrong i think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that compassion can 't be reduced to sainthood so i want to propose a final definition of compassion this is einstein with paul robeson by the way and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this and we need them to mine it for us now but so i will paraphrase einstein in closing and say that humanity the this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race"
