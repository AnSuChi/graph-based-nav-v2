  "transcript": "i have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres of course we all here in this room live in biosphere one i 've also lived in biosphere two and the wonderful thing about that is that i get to compare biospheres and hopefully from that i get to learn something so i am harvesting the wheat in order to make the dough and then of course i have to here in biosphere one well it takes me about two minutes because i pick up the phone and i call and say hey can you deliver the pizza so biosphere two was essentially a three acre entirely sealed miniature world that i lived in for two years and twenty minutes underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel essentially entirely sealed so we had our own miniature rainforest a private beach with a coral reef we had a savanna back then yes i guess we that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed that is nothing goes in or out at all no material and energetically open which is essentially what planet earth is this is a chamber that was one 400th the size of biosphere two that we called our test module and the very first day that this fellow john allen walked in to spend a couple of days days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we 'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive and it was time for us to go give it a go and we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe if we were going to go to mars for instance would we take a biosphere with us to live in it we also wanted to know so we can understand more about the earth that we all live or will something happen that we can 't understand and we can so eight of us went in four men and four women and this is the world that we lived in so on the top we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean and underneath we had all this technosphere we called it which is where all the pumps and the valves also we had the human habitat of course with the laboratories and all of this is the agriculture it was essentially an organic farm except seven other people i mean it rather and we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes i literally was eating the same carbon over and over again i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way came to our atmosphere however it wasn 't that much of a joke over the long term because it turned out that we were losing oxygen quite a lot of oxygen and we knew that we were losing co2 and so we were working to sequester carbon good lord we know that term now we were growing plants like crazy we were taking their biomass storing them in the and it was like playing atomic because your your blood chemistry has changed and that you literally do that you stop breathing and then you take a breath and it wakes you up and it 's very irritating and everybody outside thought we were dying i mean the media was making it sound like were were dying and i had to call up my mother every other day saying no mum it 's fine fine we 're not dead we 're fine we 're fine and it was time for us to put in a sense it was terrifying except that i knew i could walk out the airlock door at any time if it really got bad though who was going to say i can 't take it anymore not me that was for sure but on the other hand it was the scientific gold of the project because we could really crank this baby up as a scientific tool and we did indeed find it and we found it in the concrete essentially it had done something very simple we had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost it broke down it took oxygen out of the air it put co2 into the air and it went into the concrete pretty straightforward really so although you might say we had discovered something that was quite uhh when your oxygen is is going down except that we knew what it was and we knew how to fix it and nothing else emerged that and we proved the concept more or less people on the other hand was a different subject we yeah i don 't know that we were fixable and i recoiled they stank people stink we stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant and all kinds of stuff now we had stuff inside biosphere to keep ourselves clean but nothing with perfume and boy do we stink out here not only that but i lost touch of where my food came from i had been growing all my own food i had no idea i would stand for hours in the aisles of shops reading all the names on all of the things people must have thought i was nuts it was really quite and i slowly lost track of where i was in this big biosphere in this big biosphere that we in biosphere two i totally understood paragon space development corporation a little firm i started with people while i was in the biosphere because i had nothing else to do and what can you do with and so we sent one onto the mir space station we had one on the shuttle and one on the international space station for sixteen months where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete a team to develop a system to grow plants on the moon and part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of co2 and oxygen and water through this plant system as a result of that modeling i ended up in all places in eritrea in the horn of africa eritrea formerly part of ethiopia is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there it is so dry but this is also what i saw i i saw a company that had taken seawater and sand and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it and it will produce a food crop in this case it was oilseed and the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth frankly from an of these and turning them into all of this food they were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people they had created an industrial around the world today we 're seeing an incredible transformation from what i would call a biocidal species one that whether we or unintentionally have designed our systems to kill life a lot of the time fires we 're in the process of transforming from this to what i would call a biophilic society one where we learn to nurture society and i think often times people get lost in that i possibly find my way in that it 's such a huge subject it really does this is the story of a rake in my backyard very early on when i bought my property and in arizona of course everybody puts gravel and they like to keep everything beautifully raked and they keep all the leaves away and on sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out and i want to throttle them and and so now all the birds come in and i have hawks and i have an oasis and all of tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake the small stuff counts but we can look at the world and try"
