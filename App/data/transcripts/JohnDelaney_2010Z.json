  "transcript": "for a moment what i need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination and a little wizened monk is hurrying along midnight to the crest of a small hill he arrives on the small hill dripping with water then he says to himself very quietly was a brilliant man he said more with less than any human that i have ever read or talked to basho in seventeen driven by a storm now past and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars probably hundreds and hundreds of who knows maybe even an ocean that we will probably call sylvia in time as he was nearing his death his disciples and followers kept asking him what 's the secret how can you make haiku poems so beautiful so easily and toward the end he said if you would know the pine tree go to the pine tree that was it laughter sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have if we would know the and what i 'd like to talk to you today about a little bit is really transforming the relationship or the interplay between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet i hope it will be there are a few key points one of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth and the last is that these bold new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet our oceans and eventually how we manage it 's not even the entire pacific it 's the whole planet the entire planet continents and oceans together that 's the system and basically our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that 's driven by only two processes the clouds the storms and photosynthesis mountain ranges plate tectonics moves the continents around forms ore deposits volcanoes erupt that 's the planet that we live on it 's immensely complex now i don 't expect all of you to see all the details here but what i want you to see is this is about ten percent of the processes that operate within the oceans this is a system that 's been around a very long time these have all co evolved what do i mean by that they interact with one another constantly all of them interact with one another so the complexity of this system that we 're looking at the one driven by the sun this is very very important because this is the system this is the crucible out of which life on the planet came and it 's now time for us to understand it we must understand it that 's one of the themes that sylvia reminds us about understand this ocean of ours this this is only one variable if you can see the complexity you can see how tiny little eddies but it 's immensely complicated and you 've got a really complicated system that 's our challenge is to understand understand this system in new and phenomenal ways and there 's an urgency to this part of the urgency comes from the fact that of order and part of the issue is for cody sixteen years old and i have permission to relay this number there are going to be another two and a half billion people on the planet but if we don 't understand the fundamental life support system of much more thoroughly than we do now then the stresses and even nancy who 's going to live till she 's ninety eight will have really problems coping look at this diagram which is showing the dieback of vegetation and in the lower left hand corner there 's a clock ticking away from one thousand nine hundred and eighty two to one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and then cycling again what you 'll see is that the rhythms of growth of vegetation a subset of which is food on the continents is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface control or at least significantly influence correlate with the growth patterns and the drought patterns and the rain patterns on the continents so people in kansas in a wheat field in kansas need to understand that the oceans are central to them as well another complexity this is the age of the oceans i 'm going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference and i seconds after this video was taken people in beijing people in sydney people in amsterdam people in washington d c were watching there is vast some people have estimated that the biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below it 's an astonishing and we have only found out about this recently this is very very exciting we know little or nothing about it but possibly in having new sets of eyes new ways of seeing things a new mindset and and it wasn 't easy it wasn 't easy in those days some of you remember this i 'm sure but they don 't quite cut it they don 't quite give us what we need and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image modeling on the right hand side there 's a very complex computational model on the left hand side there 's a new type of mooring which i 'll show you in just a second and on the basis of several points the oceans are complex and they 're central to the life on earth they are changing rapidly but not predictably and the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them the computational power is and that 's what we really need for a variety of reasons they 're dangerous but we feel that ooi this ocean observatory initiative which the national science foundation has begun to fund has the potential to really transform things and the goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across utilizing widely accessible interactive it 's a new world we will be present throughout the volume of the ocean at will and this is what the system involves a number of and in the northern hemisphere there are four sites i won 't talk a lot about most of them right here but the one on the west coast that 's in the box is called the regional scale nodes it was once called neptune and let me show you what 's behind it fiber way of communicating you can see the copper tips on these things and this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five this is phenomenal bandwidth and this is what the planet looks like we are already laced up as if we 're in a fiber optic corset if you like this is what it looks like and the cables go really continent to continent and most of our communications consist of it so this is the system that i 'm talking about and it 's going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume in the overlying ocean on the sea floor and below the sea floor bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating this is what one of those primary nodes looks like and it 's like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of seattle and the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table they will bring it in a sense like having time on a telescope except you 'll have your own port climate change ocean acidification dissolved coastal upwelling fishing dynamics the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume so anyone coming along later simply accesses the the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place and this is just the first of these we 've set this up now i want to take you into the caldera on the left hand side there is a large and we 're going to go down into the axial seamount using animation here 's what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point very powerful that 's an elevator that 's constantly moving up and down but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it or they can transfer control to someone in india or china who can take over for a while because it 's all going to be directly connected through the internet there will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore all available to anyone who has any interest in using it this is going to be much more powerful than we 're flying across the there is a number of robotic systems there 's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will if those are your experiments the kinds of systems that will be down there the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor consist of if you can read them there there 's cameras there 's pressure sensors there 's seismometers it 's a full spectrum of tools now that mound right there and this is the kind of activity that we can see with high definition video because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to ten stereo hd systems running continuously and again directed through robotic techniques from land we 're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity there are emerging technologies throughout which we will incorporate into oceanography and through that convergence we will transform oceanography into something even more magical nanotechnology this is a small generator it 's smaller than a postage stamp and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move just as continuously and this is the magic one as a result of the human genome process we are in a situation where events that take place in the like an erupting volcano or something of that sort but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis we will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything like adjust the data and everything and the next generation fiber will be simply magic it 's far beyond what we currently have so the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented so within five to seven years i see us having a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean so we can reach when earthquakes take place massive amounts of these new microbes we 've never seen before come out of the sea floor we have a way of addressing that a new way of addressing that we 've determined from the earthquake activity that you 're seeing here that the top of that volcano is erupting so we deploy the troops and they fly into the erupting volcano they sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before they eject it to the surface where it floats and it is and it 's brought back to the laboratory within twenty four hours of the eruption this is doable all the pieces are there a laboratory many of you heard what happened on nine seven some doctors in new york city removed the gallbladder of a woman in france and it would be on live tv so we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world and i just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms and indeed what we can bring into your pocket it won 't be long it so let me leave you then if you 'll forgive me he says speaking i think for the human race but certainly for the ted conference and sylvia we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started arrive through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning at the source of the longest river the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for but heard half heard in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea"
