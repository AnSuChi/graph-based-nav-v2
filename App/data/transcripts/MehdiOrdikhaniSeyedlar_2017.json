  "transcript": "not that easy is it it and it 's in fact pretty impressive if but it 's also about what information our brain is trying to filter out you move your eyes towards something in order to pay attention to it think of driving for a second your direction of the eyes are in front where you don 't actually look at i 'm a computational neuroscientist and i work on cognitive brain machine interfaces or bringing together the brain and the computer i love brain patterns brain patterns are important for us because based on them we can build models for the computers and based on these models computers can recognize how well our brain functions then these computers themselves can be used as assistive devices but that also means something because choosing the wrong patterns will give us the wrong models and therefore the wrong therapies right the fact that we can shift our attention not only by our eyes but also by thinking that so i wanted to know what are the brainwave patterns when you look overtly or when you look covertly i set up an experiment for that in this experiment there are two flickering squares one of them flickering at a slower rate than the other one depending on which of these flickers you are paying attention to certain parts of your brain will start resonating in the same rate we can track where exactly you are watching or you are paying attention to i asked people to look directly in one of the squares and pay attention to it in this case not surprisingly we saw that these flickering squares appeared in their brain signals which was coming from the back of their head which is responsible for the processing of your visual information so this time i asked people to look in the middle of the screen and without moving their eyes to pay attention to either of these squares but interestingly only one of them which was paid attention to had stronger signals so there was something in the brain which was handling this information so that thing in the brain was basically the activation of the frontal area the front part of your brain is responsible for higher cognitive functions as a human the frontal it seems that it works as a filter trying to let information come in only from the right flicker that you are paying attention to and trying to inhibit the information coming from the ignored one the filtering ability of the brain is indeed a key for attention which is missing in some people a person with adhd cannot but what if this person could play a specific computer game with his brain connected to the computer and then train his own we can use these cognitive brain machine interfaces for many other cognitive fields it was just a few years ago that my grandfather had a stroke and he lost complete ability to speak he could so he passed away in silence i remember thinking at that time what if we could now after years that i am in this field i can see that this might be like the letter a generates a different brainwave pattern than the letter b and so on could a computer one day communicate for people who can 't speak what if a computer can help us understand the thoughts of a person in a coma we are not there yet we will be there soon"
