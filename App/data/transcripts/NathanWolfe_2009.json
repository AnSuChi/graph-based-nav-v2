  "transcript": "when most people think about the beginnings of aids they 're gonna think back to the 1980s but in fact this virus crossed this photo was taken before the great depression in brazzaville congo at this time there were thousands of individuals we think that were infected with hiv so i have a couple of really important questions for you why was it the case that it took us until one thousand nine hundred and eighty four to be able to discover this had we seen this disease had we understood exactly what was going on with it how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved and you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations but only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human nevertheless we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings that are going to be very very difficult to address as we 've seen in the case of hiv so during the last fifteen years i 've been working this is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these this is a picture of a central african hunter it 's actually a fairly common picture one of the things i want you to note from it is blood that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact this was absolutely key for us this is a very intimate form we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals and so we 've been studying people like this individual we these individuals but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis when they were sick we would collect specimens from them we would actually enlist them which we 've done now to collect specimens from animals we give them these little pieces of filter paper when they sample from animals they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify viruses from exactly the right animals the ones that are actually being hunted patrice and patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes they have a series of traps of snares that they 've set up to catch patrice and patee have been out for hours but found nothing we stop for a drink of water a rustle in the brush a there 's at least three viruses and there 's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals these individuals are at specific risk particularly if there 's blood contact they 're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses narrator as the hunters display their kills something surprising happens they show us filter paper they 've used to collect the animals ' blood the blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses part of a program dr wolfe has spent which presumably from our perspective gives them the village the country and the world nw ok and you can consider all sorts of different bush meat i 'm going to be talking about this when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time one of the things they 're gonna ask you is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives some of the most valuable and endangered species on our but in fact that 's not the only question they 're going to ask you about this they 're also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv entered into the human population and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this why did we let these behaviors continue why did we not find some other solution to this they 're going to say in regions of profound instability throughout the world where you have intense poverty where populations are growing and you don 't have sustainable resources like this this is going to lead to food insecurity which is why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here now this is the individual you can see just right up over his right shoulder this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that i showed you ok take a look at his shirt but it can 't be the fault of somebody like this ok and solving it cannot be his responsibility alone so in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight along with my we went to actually start this work in central africa to work with hunters in this part of the world so i said to myself ok great we 're gonna collect all kinds of specimens we 're gonna go to all these different locations it 's going to be wonderful you know i looked at the map i picked out seventeen sites i figured no problem laughter needless to say i was drastically wrong this is challenging work to do we have a whole range of challenges about this work one of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field delong minutu he 's one of the best communicators that i 've really ever dealt with when i arrived i didn 't speak a word of french and i still seemed to understand what it was he was saying paul worked for years on the cameroonian national radio and television and he spoke about health issues he was a health correspondent so we figured we 'd hire this person when we got there he could be a great often we run into obstacles this is us coming back from one of these very rural sites with specimens from two hundred individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within forty eight hours i like to ubald laughs at me when i show this photo because of course you can which he did just a few quick before and after shots this was our laboratory before this is what it looks like now early on in order to ship our specimens we had to have dry ice to get dry ice we had to go to the breweries beg borrow steal to get these folks to give it to us i like to call our laboratory the coldest place in central africa it might be and here 's a shot of me this is the before shot of me no comment and what we 've found is that if you look in the right place place you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations that gave us a tremendous amount of hope what we 've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals including new viruses in the same group as hiv so brand new retroviruses and let 's face it any new retrovirus in the human population it 's something we should be aware of it 's something we should be following it 's not something that we should be surprised by and critically what happens in central africa doesn 't stay in central africa so once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring we decided to move this from research to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort needless to say different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact so it 's not just hunters in but really this is just the beginning from our perspective our objective right now in addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably twenty or more sites throughout the world to viral hotspots because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things ideally before they make it to blood banks networks airplanes and that 's really our objective and they think we 've reached a point where we 've discovered most of the things i 'm going tell you right now please don 't despair if an intelligent extra terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet twenty seven out of thirty of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus fungus and animals humans being a footnote this is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet the dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about and yet finally we have the tools which will allow us to actually explore that world and and understand them"
