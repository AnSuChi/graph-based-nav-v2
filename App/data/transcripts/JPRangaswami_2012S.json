  "transcript": "my children usually tell me that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other but what i want to do in the next eight minutes or so is to take you through how those passions developed the point in my life when the two passions merged the journey of learning that took place from that point and one idea i want to leave you with today is what would would happen differently in your life i was born in calcutta a family where my father and his father before him and that 's actually a shop in calcutta but it 's a place where we like our thousand of them now but growing up as a child with the books around everywhere with people to talk to about those books this wasn 't a sort of slightly learned thing by the time i was eighteen i had a deep passion for books it wasn 't the only passion i had i was a south indian and two of the things they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets so by the time i grew up again i had a passion for food now i was growing up in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s and there were a number of other passions i was also interested in but these two were the ones that differentiated me until i got to about the age of twenty six and i went to a movie called short circuit oh some of you have seen it and apparently it 's being remade right now and it 's going to be coming out next year it 's the story of this experimental robot which give me input and i suddenly realized that for a robot both information as well as food i wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself as if energy and information were the two things i had as i started doing some research then and this was the 25 year journey and started finding out that actually human beings as primates have far smaller stomachs than should be the size for our body weight and as i went to research that even further i got to a point where i discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis that actually for a given body mass of a primate and two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and digestive tissue and what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about one thousand nine hundred and ninety five it 's a lady named leslie aiello and the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other if you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large you had to live with a smaller gut that then set me off completely to say okay these two are connected in origin wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted and those that were in the business of farming information wanted to build fences around it create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement so there was always going to be a tension within that and everything i saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the and this is happening here when i moved to preparation this same thing was true expect that there were two schools one group of people said you can distill your information you can extract value separate it and serve it up while another group turned around and said no no you can ferment it you bring it all together and mash it up and the value emerges that way but consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable because what i began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consume this they 'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients do you cook it do you have it served to you do you go to a restaurant the same is true every time as i started thinking about information the analogies were getting crazy that information had sell by dates that people had misused information that wasn 't dated properly and could really make an effect on the stock market on corporate values etc and and i began to start thinking of myself as whatever you call it are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it we start which brings me to the final element of this i put it to you that and we have to start thinking about how we create exercise within ourselves to have the faculties to be able to deal with information to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly in fact when i saw supersize me i what would happen if an individual had thirty one days nonstop fox news would there be time to be able to work with it so you start really understanding that you can have toxins a need to balance your diet and once you start looking and from that point on everything i have done in terms of the consumption of information the production of information the preparation i 've looked at from the viewpoint of food but i 'd like to leave you with just that question if you began to think of all the information that you consume the way you think of food what would you do differently thank you very much for your time"
