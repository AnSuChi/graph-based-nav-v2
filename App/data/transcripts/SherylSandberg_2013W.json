  "transcript": "it 's so not my regular experience as i know anyone else but that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership but how did that evolve for you as a thought and end up being the ted talk that you gave ss so i was really scared to get on this stage and talk about women because i grew up in the business world as i think so many of us did you never talk about being a woman because someone might notice that or worse about to sue them and so i went through i went through my entire business career and never spoke about being a woman never spoke about it publicly but i also had noticed that it wasn 't working i came out of college over twenty years ago and i thought that all of my peers were men and women all the people above me were all men but that would change because and it wasn 't because year after year i was one of fewer and fewer and now often the only woman in a room you cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman you 'll never be taken seriously again but fortunately there were the few the proud like you who told me i should give the speech and i asked myself the question mark zuckerberg might the founder of facebook and my boss asks all of us which is what would i do if i wasn 't afraid and i did and survived 's an important part of the journey so i had tedwomen the original one was in d c so i live here so i had gotten on a plane the day before and my daughter was three she was clinging to my leg mommy don 't go and pat 's a friend and so not related to the speech i was planning on giving which was chock full of facts and figures and nothing personal i told pat the story i 'm going to get on a stage and admit my daughter was clinging to my leg and you said yes because if you want to talk about getting more women into leadership roles you have to be honest about how hard it is and i did i started writing the book i thought it was fabulous it was chock full of data and figures i had three pages on matrilineal maasai tribes their sociological patterns my husband read it and he was like this is like eating your wheaties and i realized through the process that i had to be more honest and more open and i had to tell my stories my stories of crying at work felling like i didn 't belong and part of my journey starting on this stage going to lean in going to the foundation is so that other women can be more open and honest and all of us can work together towards real equality pm i think that one of the most striking parts about the book and in my opinion one of the reasons it 's hit such a nerve and is resonating around the is that you are personal in the book and that you do make it clear that while you 've observed some things that are very important for other women to know that you 've had the same challenges that many others of us have as you faced and then you would also put yourself in the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges ss and it was viewed a lot and it really started impacting people 's lives i got this great one of the first letters i got was from a woman and she told her best friend she turned it down and so she watched this ted talk and she went back the next day she took the job she went home and she handed her husband the grocery list and she said i can do this and what really mattered to me it wasn 't only women in the corporate world even though i did hear from a lot of them and it did impact a lot of them it was also people all different circumstances there was a doctor i met who was an attending physician at johns hopkins and he said that until he saw my ted talk it never really occurred to him so he started paying attention and as he so he started encouraging the women to raise their hands more and it still didn 't work so he could call evenly on men and women and what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better and he was able to go back to them and tell them that and then there was the woman stay at home mom lives in a really difficult neighborhood with not a great school she said that ted talk she 's never had a corporate job but that ted talk inspired her to go to her school and fight for a better teacher and i guess it was part which is why i went from the talk to the book pm and in the book but you also share what you 've learned the the experiences of other people in the lessons and that 's what i 'm thinking about in terms of putting yourself in a you became a sort of expert in how you lean in so what did that feel like and become like in your life to not just a but a movement where people began to literally describe their actions at work as i 'm leaning in i have read every study i have pored over the materials and it 's so striking except for one thing gender we think women should speak women are called bossy there is a word for bossy for little girls in every language there 's one it it 's expected please raise your hand if you 've been told you 're too aggressive at work there it runs about five percent okay get ready gentlemen if you 're a woman please raise your hand if you 've ever been told you 're too aggressive at work that is what audiences have said in every country in the world and it 's deeply supported by the data now do we think women are more aggressive than men course not it 's just that we judge them through a different lens and a lot of the character traits that you must exhibit to perform at work to get results to lead are ones that we think in a man he 's a boss and in a woman she 's bossy and the good news about this is that we can change this by acknowledging it one of the happiest moments i had in this whole journey is after the book came out i stood on a stage with john chambers the ceo of cisco he read the book he stood on a stage with me he invited me in front of his whole management team men and women and he said i thought we were good at this i thought i was good at this and then i read this book and i want you to know we 're never going to do it again pm can we send that to a lot of other and so this kind of acknowledgement of these biases can change it and so next time you all see someone call a little girl bossy you walk right up to that person big smile and you say that little girl 's not bossy that little girl has executive leadership skills pm i know that 's what you 're telling your daughter did focus in the book and the reason as you said in writing it was to create a dialogue about this i mean let 's just put it out there face the fact that women are in a time when here are some of the challenges that remain and many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves what has changed ceos they 're mostly men say to me you 're costing me so much money because all the women want to be paid as much as the men and to them i say i 'm not sorry at all everywhere i go women tell me they ask for asking for the promotions they should be getting at work and importantly believing it themselves even little things and now he made a rule that all the women on need to sit at the table the foundation i started along with the book lean in helps women or men start circles small groups it can be ten it can be however many you want which meet once a month there are over twelve thousand circles in fifty countries in the world pm wow that 's amazing ss and these are people who are meeting every single month i met one of them i was in beijing a group of women several of them grew up in very poor rural china and the process of coming together once a month at a meeting is helping them what they want in their careers the kind of partners they want if at all i looked at them we went around and introduced ourselves and they all said their names and where they 're from and and i kind of just started crying right which but the fact that a woman so far away out in the world who grew up in a rural village who 's being told to marry someone she doesn 't want to marry can now go meet once a month with a group of people and refuse that and find life on her own terms that 's the kind of change we have to hope for pm have you been surprised by the global nature of the message because i think when the book first came out many people thought well this is a really important handbook for young women on their and yet the book is being read as you say in rural and developing countries what part of that has surprised you and perhaps led to a new perspective on your part ss and it turns out everywhere in the we live in a world where the men get and and women get or i 've never met a man who 's been asked how he does it all please raise your hand if you 've been asked how do you do it all men only women women please raise your hand if you 've been asked how you do it all and i think people don 't fully understand how broad the message is there is a circle that 's been started for rescued sex workers in they 're using lean in to help people make the transition back to what would be a fair life really rescuing them from their pimps and using it for women who have never been to college and and so these messages of equality of how women are told they can 't have what men can have how we assume that leadership is for men how we assume that voice is for men and it 's part of what tedwomen does it unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in which is more women more voice more equality pm if you were invited now to make another tedwomen talk what would you say that is a result of this experience for you personally and what you 've learned about women and men as you 've made this journey ss i think i would say i tried to say this strongly but i think i can say it more strongly i want to say that the status quo is not enough and you know what we found no movement in the wage gap for women in the united states cents to the dollar if you are a black woman sixty four cents if you are a latina we 're at fifty four cents do you know when the last time those numbers went up we are stagnating we are stagnating in so many ways and i think not really being honest about that we shy away from the word feminist a word i really think we need to embrace we have to get rid of the word bossy and bring back i think i would say in a louder voice we need to get rid of the word bossy and bring back the word"
