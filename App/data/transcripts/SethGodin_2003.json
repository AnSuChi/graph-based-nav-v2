  "transcript": "cover at the end about how a company called silk tripled their sales how an artist named jeff koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact to how frank gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect and one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years a record label i started that had a cd called sauce before i can do that i 've got to tell you about sliced bread and a guy named otto rohwedder 1910s i wonder what they said like the greatest invention since and he focused like most inventors did on the patent part and the making part and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread no one wanted it that the success of sliced bread like the success of almost everything we 've talked about at this conference is not always about what the patent is like or what the factory is like it 's about can you get your idea to spread or not and i think that the way you 're going to get what you want or cause the change that you want to change to happen is to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread i think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do that what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion that people who can spread ideas regardless of what those ideas are win when i talk about it i usually and because it 's the easiest sort of way to keep score but i want you to forgive me when i use these examples because i 'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do at the heart of spreading ideas is tv and stuff like tv tv and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way interrupt some people that gets you distribution you use the distribution you get to sell more products you take the profit from that to buy more ads and it goes around and around and around the same way that the military industrial complex worked a long time ago that model of and we heard it yesterday if we could only get onto the homepage of google if we could only figure out how to get promoted there grab that person by the throat and tell them about what we want to do if we did that then everyone would pay attention and we would win tv industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours i mean all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren 't expecting in a way they didn 't necessarily want with an ad over and over again until they bought it and the thing that 's happened is they canceled the tv industrial complex that just over the last few years what anybody who markets anything has discovered i apologize i had a bad cold when i the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child i go to the deli i 'm sick i need to buy some medicine the brand manager for that blue product spent one hundred million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year one hundred million dollars interrupting me with tv commercials and magazine ads and spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff all so i could ignore every single message box because i always have and i 'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem because i don 't care here 's a magazine called hydrate it 's one hundred and eighty pages about water ads about water imagine what the world was like forty now there are magazines about water new product from coke japan water salad because they have no idea what 's going to work and what 's not i couldn 't have written this better myself it came out four days ago i circled the important parts so you can see them here hoping that that will get people to go to arby 's and buy a roast beef sandwich drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich and he was right when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea the world revolves around me i want to get memail i mean people at the defense department who might buy something or people at you know the new yorker who might print your article consumers part of the reason is they 've got way more choices than they used to and way less time and in a world where we have too many choices and too little time the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff and my parable here is you 're driving down the road and you see a cow and you keep driving because you 've seen cows before cows are invisible cows are boring who 's going to stop and pull over and say look a cow nobody but if the cow was purple isn 't that a great special effect i could do that again if you want if the cow was purple i mean if all cows were purple you 'd get bored with those the thing that 's going to decide what gets talked about what gets done what gets changed what gets purchased what gets built is is it remarkable because we think it just means neat but it also means worth making a remark about that two of the hottest cars states is a giant car big enough to hold a mini in its trunk people are paying full price for both and the only thing they have in common is that they don 't have anything in common every week the number one best selling dvd it 's never the godfather it 's never citizen kane it 's always some but the reason it 's number one is because that 's the week it came out because it 's new because it 's fresh people saw it and said i didn 't know that was there and they noticed it two of the big success stories of the last twenty years in retail one sells things that are and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them the only thing they have in common is that they 're different we 're now in the fashion business no matter what we do for a living we and people in the fashion business know what it 's like to be in the fashion business they 're used to it but it 's a totally different sort of process and which ones don 't they sold a billion dollars ' worth of aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair they turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend he lived in paris last year he sold ten million dollars ' worth of french bread it didn 't look like french bread it wasn 't what they expected it was now he 's in london and he ships by fedex all around the world what marketers used to do is make average products for average people that 's what mass marketing is smooth out the edges go for the center that it was all about going for the center but in a world where the tv industrial complex is broken i don 't think that 's a strategy we want to use any more i think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people and when you talk to them they 'll listen because they like listening it 's about them and it 'll spread it 'll spread to the entire curve they have something i call otaku it 's a great japanese they get to market an idea to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn 't have a constituency with an otaku that 's why there 's lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot and not so many kinds of mustard not because it 's hard to make interesting mustard you could make interesting mustard krispy kreme has figured this whole thing out and then they spread through the city to the people who 've just crossed the street they want to talk to the people who do and maybe it 'll spread these guys make the loudest car stereo in the world but the fact if they 've got the otaku or they 've heard from someone who does they go ahead and they pick this so when steve jobs talks to fifty thousand people at his keynote two hour commercial that 's the only thing keeping his company in business it 's that those fifty thousand people care desperately enough to watch a two hour commercial and then tell their friends released in the last two years every one made a profit they talk about it like crazy this paint can right here they didn 't just slap a new ad on the product they changed what it meant to build a paint product and i can tell you they are hard graders and he sees his grandchildren everyday and one person at a time the idea spreads these are not diamonds not really they 're made from cremains after you 're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem oh it 's my grandmother business in the whole mortuary industry but you don 't have to be ozzie osborne you don 't have to be super outrageous to do this what you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them a couple of quick rules to wrap up the first one is design is free when you get to scale the people who come up with stuff that 's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them number two the riskiest thing you can do now is be safe proctor gamble knows this right very good is average it doesn 't matter whether you 're making or you have a tract on sociology if it 's very good it 's not going to work because no one 's going to notice it so my three stories silk put sales tripled why milk milk milk milk milk not milk they didn 't triple their sales with advertising they tripled it by doing something remarkable that is a remarkable piece of art you don 't have to like it but a 40 foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of new york city is remarkable frank gehry didn 't just change a museum he changed an entire city 's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see the portland city council or who knows where they said we need an architect can we get frank gehry and my big failure i came out with an entire a record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in this remarkable new format and i marketed it straight to people with what you need to do is figure out who does care who is going to raise their hand and say i want to hear what you 're doing next and sell something to them it 's in the middle of it they don 't anymore so the founding fathers said we 've got some money to spend what can we build here and like most committees they were going to build something pretty safe and then an artist came to them this is a true artist 's rendering he wants to build a that 's something worth noticing i don 't know about you but if they build it that 's where i 'm going to go"
