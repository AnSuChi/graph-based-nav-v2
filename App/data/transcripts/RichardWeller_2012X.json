  "transcript": "i started in general medicine as most dermatologists do in britain what you learn when you go to australia is the australians are very competitive and they are not magnanimous but moving into work and we have each week what 's called a journal club when you 'd sit down and after week one it was about cardiovascular mortality a dry subject how many people die of heart disease what the rates are and they were competitive about this you pommies your rates of heart disease are shocking and of course they were right australians have about a third less heart disease than we do less deaths from heart attacks heart failure less strokes they 're generally a healthier bunch and of course they said this was because of their fine moral standing their exercise because they 're australians and we 're within britain basically your chances of dying comparing your rates of dying fifty degrees north that 's the south that 's london and places by worse news that 's even edinburgh we know about smoking deep fried mars bars chips the glasgow diet all of these things but this graph is after taking into account all of these known risk factors now sunlight of course comes into this and vitamin d has had a great deal of press a lot of people get concerned about it and we need vitamin d it 's now a requirement that children have a certain amount my grandmother grew up in glasgow back in the an association the higher people 's blood levels of vitamin d are the less heart disease they have the less cancer there seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin d is very good for you and it is to prevent rickets and so on so what i 'm going to suggest that vitamin d is not the only story in town it 's not the only reason preventing heart disease high vitamin d levels i think are a marker for and sunlight exposure in methods i 'm going to show is good for heart disease laughter now in aberdeen i started my dermatology training but i also became interested in research won the nobel prize for medicine back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and what was remarkable and here 's this incredibly simple molecule a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck but particularly cardiovascular health so it 's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises it arises in the skin well having found that and published that i thought well what so and i spent a few years in pittsburgh and i was interested in these really complex systems we thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death and how cells survive and their resistance to other things and i first off started work in in cell culture growing cells and then i was using knockout mouse models mice that couldn 't make the gene it 's a species close to human with several advantages over mice they 're free you don 't shave them they feed themselves and nobody pickets your office saying save the it seemed we couldn 't turn off the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans we put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it and the reason for this it turned out after two or three years ' work was that in the skin and it 's released but it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide nitrate no3 nitrite no2 nitrosothiols and these are more stable and your skin has got really large stores of no and we then thought to ourselves with those big stores i wonder if sunlight might i 'm an experimental dermatologist so what we did was we thought we 'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight and so what we did was we took a bunch of of volunteers and we exposed them to ultraviolet light so these are kind of sunlamps now what we were careful to do so we used ultraviolet a which doesn 't make vitamin d when we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about thirty minutes of sunshine in summer so we put patients with these subjects under the uv and their blood pressure goes down not by much as an individual level but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population and when we shone i 'm not sure exactly how much one of the subjects here was my but certainly in people older than my wife this appears to be a more marked effect and the other thing i should mention was there was no change in vitamin d this is separate from vitamin d so vitamin d is good for you it stops rickets it prevents calcium metabolism important stuff but this is a separate mechanism from vitamin d now one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place if your leg is chopped off and you lose blood your body so what we 've next done is we 've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation so we 've measured this is again notice no tail in the arm you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it but the active irradiation during the uv and for an hour after it there is dilation of the blood vessels this is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure by which you dilate the coronary arteries also to let the blood be supplied with the heart so we thought we 'd just kind of model different amounts of uv so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide the nitrates nitrites nitrosothiols in the skin cleave to release no different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that so you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that and you can look so if you live on the equator the sun comes straight overhead it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere in winter or summer it 's the same amount of light if you live up here in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down and the range of wavelengths that hit the earth so what you can do is you can multiply those data by the no that 's released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into if you 're on the equator here that 's these two lines here the red line and the purple line that 's released is the area under the curve it 's the area in this space here so ventura is in southern california in summer you might as well be at the equator it 's great lots of no is released ventura edinburgh in summer the area beneath the curve is pretty good but edinburgh in winter the amount of no that can be released is so what do we think we 're still working at this story we 're still developing it we 're still expanding it we think it 's very important we think it probably accounts a lot of the north south health divide within britain it 's of relevance to us lettuce has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects and this is ongoing work but dermatologists i mean i 'm a dermatologist my day job is saying to people you 've got skin cancer it 's caused by sunlight don 't go in the sun and i think that we need to be more aware of and we need to find the ratio how much sunlight is safe and how can we finesse this best for our general health"
