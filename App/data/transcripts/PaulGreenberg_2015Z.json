  "transcript": "i was a kid this was my team i stunk at sports i didn 't like to play them i didn 't like to watch them so this is what i did i went fishing and i came home in the early ninety 's this is what i found i started to kind of what was the rest of the world thinking about it and when i went to fish markets or paris or london or wherever and i thought this was ordinary people the way they looked at seafood was like this ten thousand years ago when we came out of our caves if you look at fire but if you telescope to the age of you know sheep and goats it 's first it 's a very very new problem this is the way we 've been fishing the oceans over the last fifty years world war ii was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish all of the technology that we perfected during world war ii sonar lightweight polymers all these things quadrupling in the course of time from the end of world war ii to the present time and right now that means we 're taking between eighty and ninety million metric tons out of the sea every year that 's the equivalent of the human weight of china taken out of the sea every year and it 's no coincidence that i use china as the example because china is now the largest fishing nation in the world which is now only in the last year or two starting to exceed so let 's look though at the four choices we are making right now the first one by far the most consumed seafood in america and in much of the west is shrimp shrimp in the wild as a wild product is a terrible product carbon intensive ways of fishing that you can find problem the place where you farm shrimp protect coasts create habitats for all sorts of young fish young shrimp all sorts of things that are important to this environment that rate of destruction has slowed but we 're still in a major mangrove deficit the other thing that 's going on here is a phenomenon that the filmmaker mark benjamin called grinding nemo we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp catching a huge amount of bycatch that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food the next most consumed seafood so tuna these huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed our own management area the great naturalist carl safina once called it the international conspiracy to catch all the tunas of course we 've seen incredible improvement in iccat in the last few years and to manage it we have to manage the globe well we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture many people don 't know this but tuna are warm blooded they can swim at over forty miles an hour so that pretty much eliminates all the advantages of farming a fish right a farmed fish is or a fish is cold blooded it doesn move too much that 's a great thing for growing protein but if you 've got this crazy wild creature that swims at forty miles an hour and heats its blood not a great candidate for aquaculture the next creature most consumed seafood in america and throughout the west is salmon now salmon got its plundering too but it didn 't really necessarily happen through fishing this is my home state of connecticut connecticut used to be home to but if you look at this map of connecticut every dot on that map is a dam there are over three thousand dams in the state of connecticut i often say this is why people in connecticut are so so uptight if somebody could just unblock connecticut 's chi i feel that we could have an infinitely better world but i made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers and this guy from north carolina sidled up to me know you oughtn 't be so hard on your connecticut cause we here in north carolina we got thirty five thousand dams so as a result we 've turned to aquaculture and salmon is one the most successful at least from a numbers point of view when they first started farming salmon it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon they 've gotten it below two to one although those pellets are in turn reduced so the actual what 's called the fifo the fish in and the fish out but in any case credit to the industry it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon problem is we 've also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we 're producing aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet it and so even though we 're doing less per fish to bring it to the market we 're still killing a lot of these little fish and it 's not just so we 've got chickens so i often wonder anyway all together though it results in a terrible mess what you 're talking about is something between twenty and thirty million metric tons of wild is a kind of amorphous thing it 's what the industry calls whitefish so the filet o fish sandwich actually started as halibut and it started because a local franchise owner found that when he served his mcdonald 's on so he went to ray kroc and he said i 'm going to bring you a fish sandwich going to be made out of halibut ray kroc said and there 's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun but let 's do this let 's have a bet whosever sandwich sells more that will be the winning sandwich 's kind of sad for the ocean that the hula burger didn 't win so he made his halibut sandwich so he turned to atlantic cod it 's the largest fin fish fishery in the united states two to three billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year the next choice is probably going to be tilapia tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of twenty years ago it 's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein and it 's been a godsend to the third world it 's actually a tremendously sustainable solution it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months the it doesn 't do what the west wants it to do it really doesn 't have what 's called an oily fish profile it doesn 't have the dha omega 3s that we all think are going to make us live forever so what do we do i mean first of all what about this poor fish the clupeids the fish that represent a huge part of that twenty to thirty million metric tons well one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them could we eat them directly instead of feeding there are arguments for it they are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market a fraction of the fuel cost of say shrimp and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale and if we were to go down that route what i would say is instead of paying a few bucks a pound or a few bucks a ton really and making it could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way of other possibility though which is much more interesting is looking at bivalves particularly mussels now mussels are very high in they 're similar to canned tuna they actually get their microalgae make the omega 3s they 're only and this is incredibly important when we look at the world right of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms we also could look at not a fish at all we could look at a vegetable we could look at seaweed the kelps all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega 3s can be high in proteins tremendously good things they filter the water just like mussels do it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows now i 'm but if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited you 're growing seaweed in the water you don 't have to water it major consideration and the last fish is a question mark we have the ability to create that creates a net gain of marine protein for us this creature would have to be vegetarian it would have to be fast growing it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate and it would have to have that oily fish profile that fatty acid profile that we 're looking for every time i new story somebody tells me we can do all that we can do it we 've figured it all out we can produce a fish that 's a net gain of marine protein and has omega 3s great it doesn 't seem to be getting scaled up it is time to scale this up if we do thirty million metric tons of seafood a third of the world catch stays in the water so i guess what i 'm saying is but if we went with this or some configuration of it we might have a little more of this thank"
