  "transcript": "which means i paint people like this but i 'm here tonight to tell you about something personal that changed my work and my perspective it 's something we all go through and my hope is that my experience may be helpful to somebody to give you some background on me i grew up the youngest of eight yes eight kids in my family i have six older brothers and a sister to give you a sense of what that 's like when my family went on vacation we had a bus my supermom would drive us all over town to our various after school activities not in the bus we had a regular car too she even took a class with me in new york city now being the youngest of eight but painting was where i made the rules that was my private world my brother asked me what do all these red dots mean next to the paintings nobody was more surprised than me the red dots meant that the paintings were sold and that i 'd be able my apartment had four electrical outlets and i couldn 't use a microwave and a toaster at the same time but still i could pay my rent so i was very happy here 's a painting from back around that time i needed it to be as realistic as possible it had to be specific and believable this was the place where i was isolated and in total control bathtubs and showers it was intimate and private and water was this complicated challenge that kept me busy for a decade i made about two hundred of these paintings some of them six to eight feet for this painting i mixed flour in with the bathwater to make it cloudy and i floated cooking oil on the surface and when i lit it up it was so beautiful i couldn 't wait to paint it i was driven by this kind of impulsive curiosity i once put all this vaseline in my head and hair just to see what that would look like don 't do that i was eager and motivated and surrounded by artists always going to openings and events i was having some success and recognition my mom and i would stay up very late i have a friend named bo who made this painting of his wife and i dancing by the ocean and he called it the light years i asked him what that meant and he said well that 's when you 've stepped into adulthood you 're no longer a child but you 're not yet weighed down by the responsibilities of life the light years it had spread to her bones and it was in her brain when she told me this i fell to my knees i totally lost it and when i got myself together and i looked at her i realized this isn 't about me this is about figuring out how to help her i researched alternative medicines is this what you want me to do and she said no she said pace yourself i 'm going to need you later she knew what was happening and she knew what the doctors and the experts and the internet didn 't know how she wanted to go through this i realized that if i tried to fix it whatever that meant and whatever situation came up just really listen to her giving up trying to control the uncontrollable and just being there in it with time slowed down and the date was irrelevant we developed a routine my brother would come for breakfast and we 'd be so glad to hear his car coming up the driveway so i 'd help her up and take both her hands she had this huge mug she made she loved to drink her coffee out of and and she loved this part she we had warm towels and slippers ready immediately so she never got cold for a second i 'd blow dry her hair my brothers would come in the evenings and bring their kids and that was the highlight of her day and she used the tiniest little teacup we could find to drink her coffee i couldn 't support her myself anymore so we hired an aide to help me with the showers these simple daily activities activities became our sacred ritual it was humbling and painful and exactly where i wanted to be we called this time the beautiful awful she died on october twenty six feeling the same thing and taking care of each other so grateful for them as someone who spends most of my time alone in a studio working i had no idea that this kind of connection this was the most important thing it so after the funeral it was time for me to go back to and here 's what happened it 's like a release of everything that was unraveling in me that safe it didn 't work and a landscape painter but i wasn 't really much of any kind of painter at all so i actually left one of these wet paintings outside overnight but i didn 't care it didn 't matter it didn 't matter and carved into them and poured paint thinner on them put more paint on top drew on them i had no plan but i was watching what was happening this is the one with all the bugs in it it was the chaos and the imperfections that were fascinating and something started to happen i got curious again this is another one from the woods there was a caveat now though i couldn 't be controlling the paint like i used to it had to be about implying and suggesting not explaining or describing chaotic turbulent surface is what told the story i started to be as curious as i was when i was a student so the next thing was i wanted to put figures in these paintings people and i loved this new environment so i wanted to have both people and this which is really just adrenaline probably but for me it and so now i want to show you what i 've been working on it 's expansive space instead of the isolated bathtub i 'm going outside instead of savoring the imperfections allowing the and in that imperfection you can find a vulnerability i could feel my my deepest intention what matters most to me that human connection that can happen in a space where there 's no resisting or controlling i want to make paintings about that so here 's what i learned we 're all going to have big losses in our lives maybe a job or a career relationships love our youth we 're going to lose our fall to your knees be humbled let go of trying to change it or even wanting it to be different it just is and then there 's space and in that space feel your vulnerability and be curious to connect to what and who is really here awake and alive it 's what we all want let 's take the opportunity to find something beautiful thank you"
