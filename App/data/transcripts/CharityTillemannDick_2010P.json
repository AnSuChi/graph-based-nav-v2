  "transcript": "are celebrating an anniversary with me i 'm not married six years before that i was starting my career as an opera singer in europe when i was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension also known as ph it happens when there a thickening in the pulmonary veins making the right side of the heart work overtime and causing what i call the physical activity becomes very difficult for people with i went to see this specialist and she was top of the field and told me i had to stop singing she said those high notes are going to kill you while she didn 't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary and as air came up from my lungs through my vocal cords it was the closest thing i had ever come i met reda girgis who is dry as toast but he and his team at johns hopkins didn 't just want me to survive they wanted me to live a meaningful life this meant making trade offs i come from colorado it 's a mile high and i grew up there with ten brothers and sisters and two adoring parents well the altitude exacerbated my symptoms so i moved to baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby i couldn 't walk as much as i used to so i opted for five inch heels and i gave up i started taking huge doses of also known as viagra my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph but after six mine and it meant one thing there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called flolan it 's a way of life doctors insert a catheter into your chest four and a half pounds every day twenty four hours that pump is at your side administering medicine directly to your heart and it 's not a particularly this is a list of the side effects if you eat too much salt if you get a bubble in your medicine because you have to mix it every morning and it stays in there you probably die but when i needed i debuted at the kennedy center was a little bit problematic when performing so i 'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ace bandage literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx hoping the doors wouldn 't open unexpectedly and the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume i graduated from graduate school in two thousand and six and i got a fellowship to go back to europe though i was attached to this ugly then in february he was a big figure in all of our lives and we loved him very much it certainly didn 't prepare me for what came next weeks later i got a call from my family my father had been in a catastrophic and he died but his well the only way i can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my and i had to return to sea level doing so knowing that i probably would never canceled most of my engagements that summer but i had one left in tel aviv so i went and and i was like is going on here i heard my heart 's valves snapping open and closed the cab stopped and i pulled my body from it feeling i fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom but i just kept on going finally with the last bottle in and the last bubble out i attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in thankfully which is a side effect of the medication and i knew i 'd be okay we but i was scared but the heart catheterization showed that wasn 't going anywhere further that a flight for life from johns hopkins hospital i performed here and there but as my condition deteriorated so did my voice i had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries i knew another young man though who had ph who died while waiting but they hadn 't developed to a point where i could take advantage of them yet and i went to the cleveland clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years for transplant i was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon and i what i could do to prepare he said be happy a happy patient is a healthy patient it was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and i still didn 't want a transplant i was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles i it was time for me to go to cleveland and to start the agonizing wait i got a telephone call it was my doctor in cleveland marie budev and everybody was really happy for me problems i had spent my whole life training my lungs and i was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up i flew to cleveland but organs and i went into surgery before i could say goodbye i fell into this apocalyptic dream world during the and in my surgeon 's 20 year career he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he 's ever performed they left my chest open for two weeks you could see my over sized heart beating inside of it i was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive infection ravaged my skin i had hoped my voice would be saved but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it so the top guy at the clinic to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box he said it would kill me so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt and if you want an example grit it is her i woke up i was whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or but life isn 't and when people are allowed to pursue their passions doctors will find they have better happier and healthier patients my parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time i couldn 't help but think of that doctor who told me and i want to tell you we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams when we do we will find that patients don and some of us might even sing"
