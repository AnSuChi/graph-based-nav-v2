  "transcript": "you build experimental kite powered hydrofoils capable of more than thirty knots and it can do amazing things so kites are more than a thousand years old and the chinese used them for military applications and even for so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights i 'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man all of the great inventors of the time like hargreaves like langley even alexander graham bell inventor of the telephone who was flying this kite were doing so in the pursuit of aviation and their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion where we powered up and took off for the wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the journal of energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity the real key observation and more height is where the more wind is and more power as much as twice as much so cut to now we still have an energy crisis and now we have a climate crisis as well well you and in reality what that means is in the next thirty to forty years we have to make ten trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow wind is the second largest renewable resource after solar so this is the dawn of the new age of kites this is our test site on maui flying across the sky i 'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power by every child 's favorite plaything and the real significant thing here is we 're developing the control systems as did the wright brothers that so this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow that 's tracing your name in the sky and we 're working towards megawatt scale machines that fly at two thousand feet so you ask how big are those machines this paper plane would be maybe a oop that would be enough to power your cell phone your cessna would be two hundred and thirty killowatts if you 'd loan me your gulfstream i 'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt if this is a refrigerator factory churning out airplanes for world war ii prior to world war ii they were making one thousand planes a year by one thousand nine hundred and forty five they were making one hundred thousand with this factory and one hundred thousand planes a year we could make all of america 's electricity in about ten years"
