  "transcript": "i 'm sitting next to howard i don 't know howard obviously and he 's going i hope you 're not next amazing performance i kind of erased everything in my brain i 'm interested but i don 't move my body and instead of using human figures let 's say a dance company finally is a negotiation between one 's private world one 's conceptual world the world of ideas of aspirations of inventions with the relationship of the exterior world and all the the limitations the naysayers because i have to say for my whole career if there 's anything that 's been consistent it and to be an architect somehow you have to negotiate between left and right and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the the outside world and then make it understood i can start any number of places because this process is also such a lineal idea like the last one it 's calvino 's idea of the quickest way between two points is the and definitely my life has been part of that i 'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things but basically what we do is we try to give coherence to the world we make physical things buildings that become a part in an accretional process they make cities and those things and the time that they are made and what i 'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material because really all i 'm interested in always as an and it 's not based on an a priori notion i have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying this is what it looks like in fact somebody mentioned ewan maybe it was you in your introduction architecture is the beginning of something because it 's if you 're not involved in first principles if you 're not involved in it 's cake decoration and i 've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators if anybody 's involved in cake decorations it 's not what i 'm interested and so in the formation of things in giving it form and i 've had for thirty years an interest in and to understand the nature of the final result of representing the building itself there 's been a continual relationship between inventions which are private which has been important to me a project which is part of an exhibition in copenhagen ten years ago which was the modeling of a hippocampus the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer but built on non sequiturs and i 'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city an accretional notion of the city and that led to various ideas of organization and then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity and it 's not any single system that makes the work it 's the relationship it 's the dynamics between the systems which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture and those systems could be identified and they could be grouped together and of course today with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping etc we have the mechanisms and what but the relationship of that as it enhances and that directly connects to ideas of city making this is a project that we just finished in penang for a very very large city project that came directly out of this process which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it which uses these processes and what you 're looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a a methodology when we 're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the the development aggregate and as the aggregates get larger we require again a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated very in this case we only used fifteen of the sixty acres of land and the forty five acres was a park and would become the legacy of the olympic village and then the broader ideas of city making start having direct influences on architecture the buildings themselves and start guiding us architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place and so i i can start this discussion in any number of places and i 've chosen three or four to talk about and it has also to do with an interest in the vast it literally is is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base and it it 's the clothing the skin without the presence of the character it became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work and and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very kind of complex space and the idea was the relationship of the space which was made up of the fold of the of the image and the dialectic or the and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations and this was the first prototype in korea as we and then the same characteristic of the fabric it has a material identity and it 's translucent and it and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is and that turned right away into another project this is the caltrans building in los and now we 're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated if you look at most buildings what you look at is the building the facade and it is the building and all of a sudden we 're kind of moving away and we 're separating the skin from the body and that 's going to lead to broader performance criteria which i 'm going to talk about in a minute and you 're looking at how it middle of los angeles right across from city hall and as it moves it takes pieces of the earth with it it bends up it 's part of a sign system which was part of the kind of legacy of los angeles the it 's transparent and it allows you to understand i think what is always the most interesting thing in any building which is the actual constructional processes that make it and it 's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work which is not occupied and this is an area that allows for that and then the skin starts transforming into other we 're using light as a building material in this case we 're working with keith sonnier in new york and we 're making this large outside room which is possible in los angeles and which is very much reflective of the urban the contemporary urban environments that you would find in shibuya or you 'd find in mexico city or sao paulo etc that have to do with activating the city transparency and an image which may be closest talks about the the use of light as a medium that light becomes literally a building material well that immediately turned into something much broader and as a scope and again we 're looking at an early sketch where i 'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower tower this is a building in san francisco which is under construction and it has to do with performance this will be the first building in the united states that took i wanted a pure thing and i can 't get it it 's a wrong attitude actually because the hybrid is probably more interesting but we took the air conditioning and we removed the air conditioning huge huge thing half a million dollars a year delta ten of these it 's just under a million square feet eight hundred and some thousand square feet ten of these would power sausalito the delta on this and so now what we 're looking at as the projects with broader problems that they expand the capabilities in terms of their this is seven hundred years ago the most amazing land sculptures they 're just totally this is the first sketch of a high school in pomona and it 's the reshaping of the earth to make it occupiable so it puts two hundred thousand square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that earth there it is modeled as it was and then there 's the school we 're interested in participating with education i have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates x y and z function what i 'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people it demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it 's a system that 's developed not sculpturally it and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building there 's an overt at least there 's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because i was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem as one would understand that and the second project that was just finished in los angeles that uses some of the same ideas it uses landscape as a major idea then again we 're doing the headquarters for noaa national oceanographic and atmospheric agency outside of washington in maryland satellites zipping around at and this is the primitive hut that 's been around for so long and what we what we wanted to do is really build this because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world and we wanted them to look down and we wanted nothing left we wanted it to stay green there 's actually three baseball fields on it right now and they 're going to stay there we put one piece directly north south and it holds the the dishes at the ears right and that the building itself is in the lower portion propelled us to look at larger scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue the ecb actually coop himmelblau in vienna just won this project where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of of a park which is parallel to the the river and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric the social cultural and the landscape recreational fabric of the city and the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing but something that 's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time the hooper bank which again used this idea of connecting typology the traditional buildings and morphology or the relationship of the development of land as an idea into a complex which is a piece of a city where we can see part of of just lifting it up and occupying it and other parts are much more energetic and intense and talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make and then where part of it is in the ground part of it is is oppositional lifts one enters the building as it and then the skin the edges of this all promote the dynamic the movement of the building as a series of and it makes for event space which has been a continual interest of ours and it 's the main idea was the gateway where it breaks the site and the building occupies both the public space and the private space and it 's that territory of i visited the site many times and everybody kind of you can see this from two kilometers away it 's an exact center of the street and the whole notion is to engage the public to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city and what i want to talk about this is the supreme court of course and dealing with michael hogan the chief justice of oregon you could not proceed without making this negotiation between one 's own values and the relationship of the character you 're working with and how he understands the court because i 'm showing him of course corbusier then we get to this image and this is where the project started interested in the phenomenon that 's taking place in here and i 'm a character that 's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there 's no such thing as nature any more nature is gone nature in the 19th century sense right we construct it and we construct those ideas and believe it or not and then that led us to kind of the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic architectural and it forced us to talk about and it led us to the project absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the courts were made of that the skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated but which were embedded with fragments of the constitution which were part of the little process all set on a plinth that defined it from the community thank you so much"
