  "transcript": "one of my favorite words in the whole of the oxford english dictionary is snollygoster and what snollygoster means is a dishonest politician although there was a platform or principle gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy something to do with words i assume but it 's very important that words are at the center of politics and all politicians know they have to try and control language it wasn 't until that the british parliament allowed and this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of brass crosby who took on parliament and he was thrown into the tower of london and imprisoned but he was brave enough he was brave enough to take them on and in the end he had such popular support in london that he won and it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase as bold as brass but to really show you how words and politics interact i want to take you back to the united states of america just after they 'd achieved independence what do you call the leader of a republican country and this was debated in congress for ages and ages and there were all sorts of suggestions on the table which might have made it i mean some people wanted him to be called some people just wanted to call him king it was tried and tested they weren 't even being monarchical they had the idea that you could be elected king for a fixed term and you know it could have worked and everybody got insanely bored because this debate went on for three weeks i read a diary of this poor senator who just keeps coming back still on this subject and the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the house of representatives were against the senate the so they wanted to give him the humblest they didn 't invent the title i mean it existed before but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting it was like the foreman of the jury and it didn 't have much more grandeur than the term foreman or overseer there were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of and that 's why the senate objected to it they said that 's ridiculous you can 't call him ' president ' who 's going to take him seriously if he 's got a silly little title like ' president of the united states of america ' laughter and after three weeks of debate in the end the senate did not cave in instead they agreed to but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn 't agree with it whose custom it is to annex the office of the chief magistrate titles of respectability not bloody president and that in the intercourse with foreign nations the majesty of the people of the united states may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity i e we don 't want to look like bloody weirdos now you can learn three interesting things from this first of all and this is my favorite is that so far as i 've ever been able to find out the barack obama president obama is there on borrowed time just waiting for the senate to spring into action the second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure you can still be waiting two hundred and the third thing you can learn and this is the really important one the point i want to leave you on is that the title president of the united states of america doesn 't sound that humble at all these days does it something to do with the slightly over five thousand nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff reality and history have endowed and so the senate won in the end they got their title of respectability but now do you know how many nations have a president a hundred and the senate won and the house of representatives lost and that 's the important lesson i think you can take away and the one i want to leave you with politicians try to pick and use words to shape but in fact reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality"
