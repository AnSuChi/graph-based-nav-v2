  "transcript": "which in turn created lake mead and made it possible for the cities of las vegas and phoenix and los angeles to provide water for people who lived in a really dry place in the 20th century we literally spent trillions of dollars building infrastructure to get water to our cities but in the last decade we 've seen the combined effects of climate change growth and competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelines and water resources you can see starting around the year two thousand the lake level started to drop and it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water intakes for las vegas high and dry concerned about this that they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure that they referred to as the third straw to pull water out of the greater depths of the lake the challenges associated with providing water to a modern city are not restricted to the american southwest the third largest city in australia brisbane came within six months of running out a similar drama is playing out today in so paulo brazil where the main reservoir for the city has gone from being completely full in two thousand and ten to being nearly empty today as the city approaches the two thousand and sixteen summer olympics well in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for it 's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water legal and social and even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors we 're just transferring the problem to someone else and there 's a good chance it will come back and bite us in the form of higher food prices and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water i think that there 's a better way to solve our urban water crisis and i think that 's to open up four new local sources of water that i liken to faucets if we can make smart investments in these new now if you told me twenty years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water i probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and that 's what i want to tell you about tonight one of the great tragedies of let me give you an example this figure here shows you the volume of water that could be collected in the city of san jose if they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits you can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line that if san jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city they 'd have enough water to get them through an entire year now i know what some of you are probably thinking the answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks and attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters rainwater harvesting now it 's not a very cost effective way to solve a water problem and if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought like california 's currently experiencing you just can 't build a rainwater tank that 's big enough to solve your problem los angeles has obtained about a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer that underlies the san fernando valley you might say to yourself do i really want to drink that stuff and that 's exactly what the city of los angeles is doing with a new project that they 're building in burbank california the water that 's captured in the quarry is slowly passed through a man made wetland and then it goes into that ball field there and that purifies the water and if the water 's still not clean enough to drink after it 's been through this natural treatment process the city can treat it again when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink the second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with the wastewater that comes out of our sewage treatment plants many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water you 've probably seen signs like this that tell you that the shrubbery but what we 're learning from our experience is that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be and that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost cost what we 're finding is that a much more cost effective and practical way of recycling wastewater is to turn treated wastewater into drinking water through a two step process permeable plastic membrane that allows water molecules to pass through but traps and retains the salts the viruses and the organic chemicals that might be present in the wastewater the ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide into two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals and these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen that break down most organic chemicals it 's safe to drink but by the time we get to the second step the advanced oxidation process we rarely see any chemicals present and that 's in stark contrast to the water supplies that we regularly drink all the time the treatment wetland receives water from a part of the santa ana river that in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent from cities like riverside and san bernardino the water comes into our treatment wetland it 's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break down the organic chemicals remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens and becomes the drinking water of the city of anaheim completing the trip from the sewers of riverside county to the drinking water supply of orange county well in california we already recycle about forty billion gallons a year of wastewater through the two stage advanced treatment process i was telling the third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all it will be a kind of of virtual tap it will be the water conservation that we manage to do and the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors because in california and other modern american cities about half of our water use happens we can have the fourth and final water tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with desalinated seawater i know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination it 's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil not a lot of water and you don 't care about climate change seawater desalination is energy intensive no matter how you slice it but that characterization of seawater we 've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination in the past two decades compared to the seawater desalination plant that was built in santa barbara twenty five years ago this treatment plant will use about but just because seawater desalination has become less energy intensive doesn 't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere so there it is with these four sources of water we can move away from our reliance on imported water through reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and we can make up the difference through a combination of stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination let 's create a water supply that will be able to withstand any of the challenges that climate change throws at us in the coming years let 's create a water supply that uses local sources and leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food let 's create a water system that 's consistent with out environmental values and let 's do it for our children and our grandchildren and let 's tell them this is the system they have to take care of in the future because it 's our last chance to create a new kind of water system thank you very much for your attention"
