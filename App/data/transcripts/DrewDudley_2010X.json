  "transcript": "just start by asking everyone a question how many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader i 've asked that question all across the country and everywhere i ask it no matter where there 's and i 've come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us something beyond us we 've made it about changing the world we 've taken this title of leader and treat it as something but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we 're not comfortable with every day we take moments where we truly are a leader and we don 't let ourselves take credit for it or feel good about it i 've been lucky enough over the last ten years to work with amazing people who 've helped me redefine leadership in a way that i think has made me happier with my short time today i want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition and on my last day there a girl came up to me and said i remember the first time i met you she said on the day before i started university i was in the hotel room with my mom and dad and i was so scared and so convinced that i couldn 't do this that i wasn 't ready for university that i just burst into tears my mom and dad were amazing we love you no matter what ' i wasn 't ready i knew i had to quit i made that decision and as soon as i made it an incredible feeling of peace came over me i turned to my mom and dad to tell them we needed to go and you had a big sign you were handing the lollipops out and you stared it was then you looked at the guy next to me smiled reached into your bucket pulled out a lollipop held it out to him and said ' you need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman next to you ' he just kind of held the lollipop out like this laughter i felt so bad for this dude that i took the lollipop as soon as i did you got this incredibly severe look on your face and already she 's taking candy from a stranger ' laughter she said everybody lost it twenty feet in every direction everyone started to howl and i haven 't spoken to you once in the i 'm going to miss you good luck and i 'm flattened she gets six feet away turns around smiles and goes you should probably know this too i 'm still dating that guy four years later a year and a half after i moved i got an invitation to their wedding i don 't remember that i have no recollection of that moment i 've searched my memory banks because that is funny and i should remember doing it and i don 't that was such an eye opening transformative moment for me to think that that maybe the biggest impact i 'd ever had on anyone 's life a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say you 've been an important person in my life was a moment that i didn 't even remember how many of you guys have a lollipop moment a moment where someone said see why not we celebrate birthdays where all you have to do is not die for three hundred and sixty five days laughter yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it if you think you haven 't think of all the hands that didn 't go up when i asked you 're just one of the people who hasn 't been told it 's scary to think of ourselves as that powerful frightening to think we can matter that much to other people as long as we make leadership something bigger than us as long as we keep leadership beyond us we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day from ourselves and from each other it ] is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light and not our darkness that frightens us my call to action today is that we need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other 's lives we need to get over it so we can move beyond it and our little brothers and sisters and one day our kids or our kids right now can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other 's how many we acknowledge how many of them we pay forward and how many we say thank you for and there is no world there 's only six billion understandings of it and if you change one person 's understanding of it understanding of what they 're capable of understanding of how much people care about them understanding of how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world you 've changed the whole thing"
