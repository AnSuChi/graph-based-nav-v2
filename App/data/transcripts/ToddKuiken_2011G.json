  "transcript": "or a robot the stuff of life meets machine and specifically i 'd like to talk with you about how bionics is evolving for people with arm amputations this is our motivation and when you lose one far less both it 's a lot harder to do the things we physically need to do there 's also a huge emotional impact and actually i spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment and we interact with the physical world with our hands and when they 're missing a barrier arm amputation is usually caused by trauma there are two general types they 're it 's not a lot different than the one you see on my patient and that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook or bend an elbow we still use them commonly because they 're very robust and relatively simple devices these are motorized devices that are controlled by little electrical signals from your muscle every time you contract a muscle it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized and it works pretty well you 're missing not only these muscles but your hand and your elbow too what do you do well our patients have to of using just their if they did how would we tell them what to do we built our own arm at the rehab institute of chicago where we 've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors or six degrees and we 've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the u s military using these prototypes that had up to ten different degrees of freedom but at the end of the day how do we tell these robotic arms what to do how do we control them well we need a neural a way to connect to our nervous system or our thought processes so that it 's intuitive it 's natural like for you and i well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain going down your spinal cord out the nerves and to your periphery and your sensation 's the exact opposite you touch yourself there 's a stimulus that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain when you lose your arm that nervous system still works those nerves can put out command signals and if i tap the nerve ending on a world war ii vet he 'll still feel his missing hand so you might say let 's go to the brain and put put and these are very exciting research really hard and it 's just too hard to use now and for my patients today so we developed a different approach we 're using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals muscles muscles will amplify the nerve signals we still have four major nerves and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it now you think close hand and a little section of your to pick that up and tell the arm to move so this is the first man that we tried it on his name is jesse sullivan he 's just a saint of a man lineman who touched the wrong wire and had both of his arms burnt so badly they had to be amputated at the shoulder jesse came to us at the ric to be fit with these state of the art devices and here you see them i 'm still using that old technology with a bicycle cable on his right side and he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches and he operates so my colleague dr greg dumanian did the surgery first we cut away the nerve to his own muscle then we took the arm nerves and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest and closed him up and after about three months the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch after six months the nerves grew in well and you could see strong contractions and this is what it looks like this is what happens when jesse thinks open and close his hand you can see the movements on his chest and those little hash marks are where we put our antennae or electrodes and i challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this he has not learned how to do this with the chest there is not a learning process that 's why it 's intuitive and he 's using those switches to move little blocks from one box to the other he 's had that arm for about twenty 's pretty good with it just programmed a little different you can see that he 's much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks and we 're only able to use three of the signals at this time and after a few months you touch jesse on his chest and he felt his missing hand he feels hot cold sharp so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand imagine sensors in the hand coming up and pressing on this new hand skin so it was very exciting and here we deinnervate or cut the nerve away just from little segments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our up down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal it is two months he 's about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric all so one of the best parts of my job is working with really great patients who are also our research collaborators and we 're fortunate today to have amanda kitts come and join and i was driving home from work and a truck was coming the opposite direction came over into my lane ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my your amputation you healed up and you 've got one of these conventional arms can you tell us how it worked ak well it was a little difficult because all i had to work with was a bicep and a tricep so for the simple little things like picking something up i would have to bend my elbow and then i would have to cocontract to get it to change modes when i did that i had to use my bicep to get the hand to close use my tricep to get it to open cocontract again to get the elbow to work again tk so i think about nine months later that took six more months to have all the reinnervation then we fit her with a prosthesis i was able to so i didn 't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that tk a little faster ak a little faster and much including over a dozen of our wounded warriors in the u s armed services the success rate of the nerve transfers is very high it 's like ninety six percent because we 're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle and it provides intuitive control our functional testing those little tests all show that they 're a lot quicker and a lot easier and the most important thing is our patients have appreciated it so that was all very exciting but we want to do better there 's a lot of information in those nerve signals and we wanted to get more you can move each finger you can move your thumb your wrist we get more out of it so we did some experiments where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks and then we used some algorithms that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms but i can i can 't put in an electrode and say go there so we collaborated with our colleagues in university of new brunswick came up with this algorithm control which amanda can now demonstrate ak rotation that goes and it can go all the way around and i have the wrist flexion and extension and i also have the hand closed and open tk thank you amanda now this is a research arm but it 's made out of commercial components from here down and a few that i 've borrowed from around the world obviously that 's heavy for amanda so we 've developed a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back and is operating this all by the way she trains it to use her individual muscle signals so amanda when you first started using this arm how long did it take to so i couldn 't just train it anywhere so if it stopped working i just had to take it off so it 's able to train with just this little piece on the back takes about a minute tk so we and that that 's where our goal is to have something clinically pragmatic to wear we 've also had amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms that i showed you earlier here 's amanda using an arm and it now has a hand that can do different grasps what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think what hand grasp pattern do i want it goes into that mode and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand i had a power grasp and i had a fine if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial i want you to watch closely and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different surfaces and she could feel different textures of sandpaper different grits ribbon cable as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin so that 's an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back potentially some skin sensation and he 's squeezing a foam toy but look at all the electrodes around it i 've got a real estate problem you so we 're really challenged on what we 're doing there so for example one is to get rid of my real estate problem and get better signals we want to develop these little tiny so that it 's not worrying about electrode contact and we can have the real estate open to try more sensation feedback this arm they 're always made for the 50th percentile male which means they 're we 're making an arm that is we 're starting with the opens all the way two degrees of freedom and an elbow so it 'll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made once we can do it that small it 's a lot easier making them bigger and there was a computer spook a broken wire a converter that sparked we took out a whole circuit in the hotel and and just about put on the fire alarm but i have a really bright research team and thankfully dr annie simon was with us and worked really hard yesterday to fix it and fortunately it worked today so thank you very"
