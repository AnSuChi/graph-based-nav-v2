  "transcript": "when are we going to get fusion it 's really been a long time since we 've known about fusion we 've known about fusion since one thousand nine hundred and twenty when sir arthur stanley eddington and the british association for the advancement of science conjectured that that 's why the sun shines always been very worried about resource i don 't know about you but when my mother gave me food i always sorted the ones i disliked from the ones i and as a child you 're always and once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world 's resources i got very upset about as upset as i did when i realized that the earth will only last about five billion years before it 's swallowed by the sun big events in my life a strange child energy at the moment is dominated by probably the only person who really enjoys it when mister putin turns off the gas tap because my budget goes up we 're really dominated now by those things that we 're using up faster and faster and faster and as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the third world in the developing world we it 's really from knowledge if you look fifty years into the future the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three with some wind with some other things but these are going to be the base load energy drivers and we certainly have to develop solar but we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world fission our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations they 're going to put in six new nuclear power stations and probably more after that china is building nuclear power stations everybody is because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon free energy but if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is the perfect energy source is one that doesn 't take up much space has a virtually inexhaustible supply is safe doesn 't put any carbon into the atmosphere we 've been trying for fifty years okay what is fusion here comes the nuclear physics sorry about that but this is what turns me on i was a strange child go towards iron and you can get energy out this way and indeed that 's exactly what stars do in the middle of stars but it 's a hard process to do and there is one reaction that 's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do deuterium which you can get from seawater and tritium which is super heavy hydrogen but when you get them close enough something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together so most of the time they repel you get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together for a moment they become helium five because they 've got five particles inside them so that 's that process there deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium five helium splits out and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration and it 's this reaction that we want to do there is one trickiness about this reaction well there is a trickiness that you have to make it one hundred and fifty million degrees but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet it 's pretty hot the trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn 't exist in nature you have to plus a neutron so you can make that happen now why the hell would we bother to do this this is basically why we would bother to do it if you just plot how much fuel we 've got left and as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil the the blue line by the way is the lowest estimate of existing resources and the yellow line is the most optimistic and as you go across there you will see that we 've got a few tens of years and perhaps one hundred years of and we will have to extract uranium from sea water which is the yellow line to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us this is a bit shocking because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet kyoto and do all those kind of things go any further you would have to have breeder technology and breeder technology everybody can get it that 's why we want to do and we get within and in fact we 've done this we hold it with a magnetic field and inside it right in the middle of this and just down the road this is jet it 's the only machine in the world that 's actually done fusion when people say fusion is thirty years away and always will be i say yeah but we 've actually done it right we can do fusion in the center of this device we made sixteen megawatts of fusion power in one thousand nine hundred and we 've got to take that we 've got to make that into a fusion reactor because we want thirty million years worth of fusion power for the earth it gets very expensive to do this research it turns out you can 't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense right seven but that 's not we have to get to this and i 'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is but at the moment all we can imagine is sometime in the"
