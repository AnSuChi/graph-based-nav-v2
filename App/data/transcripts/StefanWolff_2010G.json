  "transcript": "today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about yet but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict three things stand out leadership diplomacy and institutional design and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways that is how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace but let 's start at the beginning civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now for nearly two decades now the news has been bad and the images have been haunting after years of stalemate we saw a full scale resurgence of violence in august two thousand and eight contested presidential elections in two thousand and seven we just heard about them quickly led to high levels of inter ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people in sri lanka a decades long civil war after perhaps as many as one hundred thousand people had been killed since unprecedented levels of violence occurred including many ethnic uzbeks who fled to neighboring uzbekistan in the middle east conflict between israelis and palestinians continues unabated and it becomes ever more difficult to see how just how darfur may have slipped from the news headlines but the killing and displacement there continues as well and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom and in iraq finally violence is on the rise again and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections but hang on this talk is to be about the good news so are these now the images of the past well that does represent some good news over the past two decades since the end of the cold war there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars since the high in the early with about fifty such civil wars ongoing we now have thirty percent fewer such conflicts today the number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two the lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in two thousand and the overall trend and this is the important bit clearly points downward for the past two decades the news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be from over twelve thousand civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in hundred and ninety seven and one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight a decade later this figure stands at four thousand this is a decrease by this decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in rwanda in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four but then eight hundred thousand civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months this certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed what is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story and they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective if often non lethal weapons in civil war to put it differently there is no good war thus even though or tortured is one too many the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago is good news so we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed and the big question of course is why but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences the defeat of the tamil tigers in sri lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this so called military solutions in the balkans in the south caucasus and across most of africa at times they are complimented by but hardly ever do they represent a resounding success but for many parts of africa a colleague of mine once put it this way on tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on wednesday morning but let 's look at the good news again or for sustainable peace afterwards diplomacy and institutional despite centuries of animosity decades of violence one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight saw the conclusion of an historic agreement its initial version crucially for the long term success of the peace process in northern the core institutions that were put in place in in two thousand and six and two thousand and eight were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties power sharing arrangement in northern ireland with cross border institutions that link belfast and dublin and thus irish dimension of the conflict and significantly there 's also a clear focus on both but so is the underlying conflict perhaps most importantly local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise not always fast and not who ever could have imagined ian paisley and martin mcguinness or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries 's long lasting civil war in two thousand and three diplomacy and institutional design or the successful ending of the conflict in aceh in indonesia in two thousand the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement rather local leaders committed to revisiting them later on yet instead of grasping this opportunity local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted the events of nine eleven and its provisions may yet return to war between north and south changes and shortcomings in leadership more off than on international diplomacy escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in africa 's largest country the failure to achieve a negotiated solution for kosovo and the violence tension and de facto partition that resulted from it central among them are three first the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands second an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by western support for kosovo 's independence and third a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of serbs and albanians alike by the same token and here we have some good news again the very fact that there is a international presence in kosovo and the balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both local leaders and they can make a difference for the better a cold war but a cold peace is still better than a hot war good news is also about learning the right lesson so what then distinguishes the israeli palestinian conflict or the civil war in sudan from that in liberia both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind in the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man made disasters leadership needs to be capable determined and visionary in its commitment to peace leaders need to connect to each other diplomacy sustained and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement third institutional design innovative thinking and flexible and well funded implementation conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise and they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table the most critical lesson of all is this local commitment to peace is but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence yet no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have therefore we must invest in developing leaders leaders that have the skills vision and determination to make peace leaders in other words that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices but it also requires us today 's generation to take responsibility and to learn the right diplomacy and institutional design so that the child soldiers of today thank you"
