  "transcript": "i didn 't always love unintended consequences but i 've really learned to appreciate them and i 'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do let 's go to forty thousand years before the present to the time of the cultural explosion when music art so many of the things that we 're enjoying today so many of the things that are being demonstrated at ted were born that if our ancestors forty thousand years ago they were responding they were making it possible for us to do what they do and yet they didn 't really understand how they did it now let 's advance what about the origins of agriculture and i could just imagine the committees reporting back to them it was simply awful for women the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning noon and night it was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality i think they very well might have said let 's call the whole thing off historically according to one japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the university of michigan resulted in long term changes in the and we are also changing our teeth right now there is evidence that the the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time that 's not necessarily in the ancient world reflected in the tree of knowledge in pandora 's box and especially in the myth of the physicians of the ancient world especially the egyptians who started and the translations of the surviving this i will not treat this i cannot treat they were very conscious so were the followers of hippocrates the hippocratic manuscripts also repeatedly according to recent studies show how important it is not to do harm harvey cushing who really developed neurosurgery as we know it who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a a hopeful outlook he was very conscious now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century we find a new style of technology what we find is no longer simple but systems we find more and more complex arrangements of machines mid 19th century who were the original hackers thomas edison would have been very very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today and hackers had a a word for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems that was the origin of the word bug samuel mark twain was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times at least until one thousand nine hundred and eighteen registered with the u s patent office that was the paige typesetter the patent had sixty four pages of text and two hundred and it was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type including returning the type to its place which was a very difficult thing and mark twain who knew all about typesetting and this an important thing about 19th century technology that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea the lesson of the titanic for a lot of the contemporaries was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship and this was the result of of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them however there was another case the eastland a ship that capsized in chicago harbor in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen and it killed eight hundred and forty one people that was fourteen more than the passenger toll of the the reason for it in part was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship the ballast and and it saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies it could benefit and my favorite example of that which is not really widely known as a technological miracle but it may be one of the greatest of all times was no commercially and medically they scaled up penicillin from preparation in one liter flasks to vats that was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time in the world war too the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of great britain so there were benefits in calamities benefits to pure science as well as to applied science and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating ventilating and air conditioning systems raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction and they developed a bactericide that became widely used but something else happened in the early and ibm which made them just didn 't know what to do they commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts what happened was the bactericide was formulated with minute and these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads so they reformulated the bactericide but what 's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering at least indirectly from a human disease so it shows that we 're really all in this together unfortunately our ability to model their long term behavior which has also been increasing so one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight one very positive consequence of 20th century technology though was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances there are two brent goldfarb and david kirsch who have done some extremely interesting much of it still unpublished and they 've discovered that the greatest number the greatest decade for fundamental which the inventor was a patent attorney he really was not intending to to work in in patent research but he couldn 't really find an alternative technical job so this was the best job he could get he was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions and so he which he patented in the late and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in one thousand nine hundred and sixty we see that sometimes as a result of these dislocations as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference that depressions and and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity what does this mean it means i think 're living in a time of unexpected possibilities benjamin graham developed his system of and he published that the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook so many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters now think of the large and small plagues that we have now spam and it 's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question who in the was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry so very often some kind of disaster sometimes the so this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences we need to take a really positive view we need to see what they can do for us we need to learn from those figures that i mentioned we need to and as a result when we say this isn 't brain surgery that pays tribute to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered and we can also remember the message then for me about unintended consequences is let 's make better use of it thank you very much"
