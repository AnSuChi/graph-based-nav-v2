  "transcript": "the job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when i was fifteen years old and i started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally and i went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets and i made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance but i noticed that most of the food that i was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption in factories and farms we were hemorrhaging out food i 'd been round the back i 'd seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites and i thought i noticed a particularly tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time sat down and ate my breakfast with my pigs that was the first act of what i later learned to call freeganism really an exhibition of the injustice of as it were a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food and exposing most importantly to the public that when we 're talking about food being thrown away we 're not talking about rotten stuff we 're not talking about stuff that 's beyond the pale we 're talking about good fresh food that is what this shows is unfortunately empirical data good hard stats don 't and therefore to prove my point i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted so i took the food supply of every single country it 's based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people 's mouths that black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste there will always be waste i 'm not that unrealistic that i think we can live in a waste free world but that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country nutritional for every person in that country any dot above that line and you 'll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world represents unnecessary surplus and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country and as you can see most european and north american countries fall between one hundred and fifty and two hundred percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations so a country like america has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the american people but the thing that really struck me when i and it was a lot of numbers was that and then they level off and they don 't really go the maize the soy the wheat that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed feed itself a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs when people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the we 've never had such gargantuan surpluses before in many ways this is a great success story of human and when we chop down forests as we are every day to grow more and more food when we extract water from depleting water reserves when we emit fossil fuel we have to think about what we can start saving one of the local supermarkets that i often visit to i found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there and so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the we start out with nine that 's what 's in fields that 's a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture whether it 's a lack of infrastructure refrigeration pasteurization grain stores even basic fruit crates which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields the next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock unfortunately our beasts are inefficient and we 've only kept this one in meat and dairy products this is what most of us think of when we think of food waste what ends up in the garbage what ends up in supermarket bins what ends up in restaurant bins we 've lost another two and we 've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between which is unofficial bin inspections we wouldn 't need to go sneaking around the back opening up bins and having a look at what 's it represents a colossal waste of food but what i discovered whilst i was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg when you start going up the supply chain you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale can i have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house who lives in a household where that crust that slice at the first and last end of each loaf i 'm glad to say what i see across the world and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it i certainly haven 't so i kept on thinking where do those crusts go thirteen thousand slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day day fresh bread where people in two thousand and eight were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies we contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in britain and elsewhere in the world we take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on go one step up and you get to farmers who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards this farmer for example has invested sixteen thousand pounds in growing spinach not one leaf of which he harvested because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications all being discarded perfectly edible because the wrong shape or size testicles all of these things which are traditional delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy offal consumption has halved in britain and america in the last thirty years as a result this stuff gets fed to dogs at best or is i was sitting in a roadside cafe i my goodness what taboo have i broken how have i insulted my host he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl and he said clean i thought my god you know i go around the world telling people to stop wasting food this guy has thrashed me at my own game but it gave me faith it gave me faith that we the people do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale we do have the power to bring about that change we 've lost touch with food this is an experiment i did on three lettuces who keeps lettuces in their fridge the one on the left was kept in a fridge for ten days the one in the middle on my kitchen table not much difference the one on the right i treated like cut flowers it 's a living organism cut the slice off stuck it in a vase of water it was all right for another two weeks after this i answered that question when i was fifteen in fact humans answered that answered that question six thousand years ago we domesticated pigs that practice has become illegal it 's unnecessary if you cook food for pigs just as if you cook food for humans it is rendered it 's also a massive saving of resources at the moment europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from south america where its production contributes to global warming to deforestation to biodiversity loss to feed livestock here in europe at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them if we did that and fed it to pigs we would save that amount of carbon if we feed our food waste which is the current to anaerobic digestion which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity we knew that during the war"
