  "transcript": "charles darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man in a over the course of his life darwin had great privilege he lived now what is so interesting and to some the extent what 's a bit infamous about the origin of species is that there is only one line in it about human will be thrown on the origin of man and his history it wasn 't until much longer much later that darwin actually spoke now in his years of he knew that skin color was one of the most important ways in which people well he didn 't write anything about it in the origin of species he did have something to say about it and it was quite curious he said of all the differences between the races of men the color of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked and he went on to say these differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate so he had traveled all around he had seen people of different colors living in different places and yet he now one of the wonderful things that nasa does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment and for many decades now the toms seven satellite data shown here the incrementally cooler colors blues greens yellows and finally grays indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation what 's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the northern hemisphere is in these cool gray zones this has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation and that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution and so when we look at a map of skin color and predicted skin color and the lightest ones toward the poles what 's very very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in the genus homo were darkly pigmented in those early days we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation the uvc the most energetic type was occluded by the earth 's atmosphere but uvb and uva especially came in unimpeded uvb turns out to be incredibly important it but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin d in the skin the health of our immune system and myriad other important functions in our bodies we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin this in our skin served as a superb natural sunscreen this polymer is amazing because it 's present in so many different organisms melanin in various forms has probably been on the earth a billion years and has been recruited over and over again by evolution as often happens so melanin was recruited in our lineage and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in africa and the breakdown of a very important molecule which helps to fuel cell production and reproduction in the body so it 's wonderful we evolved this very protective wonderful covering of melanin but then major moves outside of our equatorial homeland from africa into other parts of the old world and most recently into the new world when humans dispersed into these latitudes but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime so but all of the in the winter when you are skiing in the alps you may experience ultraviolet radiation but it 's all uva and significantly that uva has no ability to make vitamin d in your skin so people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft because what happened in order to ensure health and well being these lineages of people dispersing into the northern hemisphere lost their pigmentation here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once not just twice but probably the neanderthals a remarkable remarkable testament to the power of evolution and just in the last five thousand years in increasing rates over increasing distances here are just some of the biggest movements of people and not all these moves were voluntary between one thousand five hundred and twenty and twelve million five hundred people were moved from high uv to low in the transatlantic slave trade now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences but it also had deleterious health consequences to people so what we 've been on the move we 're so clever we can overcome all of these these seeming biological impediments well often we 're unaware of the fact that we 're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high uv areas some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low uv areas these have tremendous consequences for our health we have to if we 're lightly pigmented be careful about the the problems of epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin or working inside all the time because vitamin d deficiency from a lack of ultraviolet b radiation is a major problem vitamin d deficiency creeps up on people and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones to their gradual decay of their immune systems or loss of immune function and probably some problems with their their mood and health their mental health as we know are incredibly profound we live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another but often brought into proximity initially two hundred years after darwin 's birthday we have the first moderately pigmented president of the united states how wonderful is that but we need to think about how he compares in terms of his pigmentation to other people on earth he as one of many urban admixed populations is very emblematic of a mixed parentage of a mixed pigmentation these people have a tremendous potential to tan to develop more pigment in their skin as a result of exposure to sun they also run the risk of vitamin d like that guy the evolution of human skin pigmentation what is the evidence for evolution you don 't have to think about some exotic examples or fossils you just have to look at your skin darwin i think would have appreciated this i think were he able to look at the evidence we have today and most of all he would teach it products of evolution"
