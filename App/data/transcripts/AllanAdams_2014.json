  "transcript": "if you look deep into the night sky and further galaxies and further more galaxies but if you keep looking eventually you see nothing for a long while and from it sprung everything we see now we 've mapped that afterglow with and when i say we i mean people who aren 't me we 've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision and one of the shocks about it is that it 's almost completely uniform fourteen billion light years that way and fourteen billion light years that way it 's the same temperature now it 's been fourteen billion years since but it 's not exactly two point seven degrees it 's only two point seven degrees to about and where there was a little more stuff we have galaxies and clusters and those small little you take a bell and you whack the bell with a hammer what happens it rings but if you wait that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don 't notice it anymore but the thing ringing and the hammer would be quantum what they found on monday and here 's how they found it those gravitational waves in the structure of space are totally invisible for all practical purposes but early on when the universe was making that last afterglow the gravitational waves put little twists in the structure of the light that we see cleanest air they possibly could find looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol the signal of gravitational waves and the thing that 's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing though that is awesome the thing that 's totally amazing the reason i 'm on this stage is because what that tells us is something deep about the early universe it tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble and this is the idea of inflation one large bubble surrounded by something else this isn 't conclusive evidence for inflation but anything that isn 't inflation that explains this will look the same this is a theory an idea that has been around for a while and we never thought we we 'd really see it for good reasons we thought we 'd never see really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger roiling pot of universal stuff we but by going to the south pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky we can figure out thanks a lot"
