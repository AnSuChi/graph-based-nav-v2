  "transcript": "but i think in my career that 's been a good thing i 'm a civil rights lawyer and i began my career working police abuse cases in the united states and then it turns out that tears just aren 't much help when you 're trying to investigate a genocide the things i had to see and feel and touch were pretty unspeakable what i can tell you is this that the rwandan genocide was that word compassion actually comes from two latin words and not just to tears but to actually stop the genocide now by contrast i 've also been involved with one of the world 's greatest successes it 's a cause that probably has involved all of us here i don 't know if your first introduction might have been choruses of we are the world or or maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water i don 't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but i do remember the most jarring it was when i met venus she 's a mom from zambia she 's got three kids and she 's a widow when i met her she had walked about twelve miles in the only garments she owned to come to the capital city and to share her she described what it was like when the coals on the cooking fire finally just went completely cold when that last drop of cooking oil finally ran out despite her best efforts she had to watch her youngest son peter suffer from malnutrition and then as peter finally grew cold we whose kids have plenty to eat and we 're moved not only to care about global poverty but to actually try to do our part to stop the suffering now but the truth is this the fight against global poverty is probably the broadest longest running manifestation of the human phenomenon of compassion and so i 'd like to share a pretty shattering insight that might forever change the way you think about that struggle but first let me begin with what you probably already know thirty five years ago when i would have been graduating from high they told us that forty thousand kids every day died because of poverty that number today is now down to seventeen thousand but it does mean that every year moreover the number of people in our world who are living in extreme poverty which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day that has fallen from this is massive progress and this exceeds everybody 's expectations about what is possible and i think you and i i think honestly that we can we can feel proud and encouraged to see the way that compassion actually has the power but here 's the part that you might not hear very much about are still stuck there well let 's think about venus for a moment now for decades my wife and i have been moved by common compassion to sponsor kids to fund microloans to support generous levels of foreign aid but until i had actually talked to venus i would have had no idea that none of those approaches actually addressed why she had to watch her son die we were doing fine venus told me until brutus started to cause trouble now brutus is venus ' neighbor and cause trouble is what happened the day after husband died and robbed their market stall none of the traditional were going to stop brutus because they weren 't meant to this became even more clear to me when i met griselda she 's a and one of the things we 've learned over the years is that perhaps the most powerful thing that griselda and her family can do the experts call this but when we met griselda she wasn 't going to school in fact she was rarely ever leaving her home days before we met her while she was walking home from church with her family in broad daylight men from her community just snatched her off the street and violently raped her see griselda had every opportunity to go to school it just wasn 't safe for her to get there and griselda 's not the only one around the world poor women and girls between the ages of fifteen and they are when victims of the everyday violence of domestic abuse and sexual violence those two forms of violence account for more death and disability than malaria than car accidents than war combined the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence in south asia for instance i could drive past this rice mill but i would have no idea until later that he was actually a slave held by violence in that rice mill since i was in high school programs right in his community were never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves from the in fact half a century of anti poverty programs experts tell us that there 's about because in the lives of the poor it just descends like a plague and it residents will tell you that their greatest fear but notice the violence that they fear it already is the problem is not that the poor don 't get that they don 't get law enforcement in the developing world basic law enforcement systems are so broken that recently the u n issued a report that found that most poor people live outside now honestly you and i have just about no idea of what that would mean because we have no first hand experience of it in fact nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers where the average response time to a police nine so we take this just completely for granted but what if there was no law enforcement to protect you a woman in oregon recently experienced what this would be like she was home alone in her dark house on a saturday night when a man started to tear his way into her home this was her worst nightmare because so terrified she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do she calls nine hundred and eleven but only to learn that because of budget cuts in her county law enforcement wasn 't available can you ask him to go away call the sheriff 's office tomorrow obviously if he comes in and unfortunately and this is where billions of our poorest live what does that look like in bolivia for example if a man sexually assaults a poor child statistically in south asia and so the epidemic of everyday violence it just rages on and it devastates our efforts to try to help billions of people out of their hell it turns out that you can give all manner of goods and services to the poor but if you don 't restrain the hands of the violent bullies from taking it all away you 're going to be very disappointed in the long term but it 's not auditors of international assistance recently couldn 't find even one percent of aid going to protect the poor from the lawless chaos of everyday violence and honestly when we do talk about violence against the poor sometimes it 's in the weirdest of ways and then celebrates the but not a word about the rapists who are still right there in the community if a young woman on one of our college campuses was raped on her walk to the library we would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm and yet for some reason this is okay for poor people now the truth is the traditional experts in economic development and poverty they don 't talk about it but the more fundamental reason that law enforcement for the poor in the developing world is so neglected is because the people inside the developing world with need it i was at the world economic forum not long ago talking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world and i was just asking them how do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence and they looked at each other and they said practically in unison we buy it private security forces in the developing world the largest employer on the continent now but see the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer but the this is a a massive and scandalous outrage and it doesn 't have to be this way broken law enforcement can be fixed violence can be stopped almost all criminal justice systems they start out broken and corrupt but they can be we have to start making and secondly we have to begin to seriously invest resources and share expertise to support the developing world as they new public systems of justice not private security that give everybody a chance to be safe recently the gates foundation funded a project in the second largest city of the philippines where local advocates and local law enforcement were able to transform corrupt police and broken courts so drastically that in just four short years they were able to measurably reduce the commercial sexual violence against poor kids by seventy nine percent you know from the hindsight of history what 's always most inexplicable and inexcusable are the simple failures of compassion because i think history convenes a tribunal of our grandchildren where were you grandpa when the jews were fleeing nazi germany and were being where were you and grandma where were you when they were marching our and grandpa where were you when they were beating our african american neighbors just because they were trying to register to vote likewise where were you when two billion of the world 's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos of everyday violence i hope we can say thank you very boost police training how hard a process is that there 's actually now political will to do that but it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise there 's a political will struggle that 's going to take place as well but those are winnable fights because we 've done some examples around the world at international justice mission that how much it costs to make a material difference to police for example i know that 's only one piece of it gh in guatemala for instance we 've started a project there with the local police and court system prosecutors to retrain them so that they can actually effectively bring these cases and we 've seen prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence increase by and the kind of bang you can get for your buck in terms of leveraging a criminal justice system that could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led and these countries especially a middle class is seeing that there 's really no future with this total instability and total privatization of security i think there 's an opportunity a window for change ca but to make this happen you have to look at each part in the chain the the police who else gh so that 's the thing about law enforcement it starts out with the police they 're the front end of the pipeline of justice but they hand if off to the prosecutors and the survivors of violence have to be supported by social services all the way through that so you have to do an approach that pulls that all together in the past so it 's about pulling that which is imperfect in our own experience for sure but boy is it a great thing to sense that you can call nine hundred and eleven and maybe someone will gary haugen"
