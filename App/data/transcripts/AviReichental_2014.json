  "transcript": "but i did inherit his love for making that it doesn 't exist that much anymore you see while the industrial revolution it eradicated the very skill but all of that is about to change all started with it was printed in one thousand nine by who invented 3d printing but the thing that i want to talk to you about today the big idea that i want to discuss with you and it 's going to usher in a new era of localized distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication you all know your shoe size how many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples wouldn 't it be awesome if you could for the first time get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn 't require it was a beautiful robotic so she challenged me to make her something and we did we built her an amazing suit the incredible part about what i learned from amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3d printing and we say to ourselves it 's going to replace traditional methods amanda looked at it and she said it 's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity and you know what she 's not standing still she now wants to walk in high heels it doesn 't stop there 3d printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry and as we sit here today you can go wireless on your braces with clear your dental restorations millions of in the ear hearing aids are already 3d printed today millions of people are served today from these devices what about full knee replacements made to measure where all of the tools and guides are 3d printed is using 3d printing to make the next generation leap engine that will save fuel to the tune of about fifteen percent and cost and their customers and the environment but you know the even better news planetary resources a startup for space explorations is going to put out its first space probe later this year it 's only possible because of the development of printing that for the first time will make functional powered by 3d printing what if we could for the first time make incredible delectables like what if we could completely change the experience like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3d printed and which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized and that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3d printing with 3d printing complexity is free the printer doesn 't care and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it many people think that be the end of manufacturing as we know it i think that it 's the opportunity to put tomorrow 's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities and with that everybody can become an expert maker and an so we 're developing it will make it easier to create content like democratized counterfeiting so many people ask me will we have a 3d printer in every home i think it 's the wrong question to ask the right question to ask is how will 3d printing change my life including these shoes at the amsterdam fashion show now these are not my grandfather 's shoes these are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper local manufacturing my grandfather didn 't get to see nike printing cleats for the recent super bowl and thanks to and by standing in these shoes thank you"
