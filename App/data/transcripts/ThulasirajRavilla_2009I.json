  "transcript": "i 've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering it really is a story of dr venkataswamy i think first it 's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind a big part of it but i think it also deprives the person of their livelihood their dignity their independence and their status in the family so she is just one amongst the millions who are blind and the irony is that they don 't need to be a simple well proven surgery can restore sight to millions and something even simpler a pair of glasses can make millions more see if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses then almost one in five indians today we 're reaching not even ten percent of them so this is the context in which aravind started this with no money he had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan and over time we have grown into a network of what we call vision centers we have done about three and a half million surgeries a vast majority of them each year we perform about three hundred thousand surgeries we would do about a thousand surgeries see about six thousand patients send out teams into the villages to examine bring back patients lots of telemedicine consultations and on top of that do a lot of training both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of and doing it well requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work and i think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by dr v and fostering the the culture of innovation you seem to be one with an implicit faith in you and then you respond to it here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me i must do my best for her when we grow in spiritual consciousness we identify ourselves with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation it is ourselves we are helping it is ourselves this helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient centric organization and a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in he kept talking about mcdonalds and hamburgers and none of it made any sense to us he wanted to create a franchise a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of mcdonald 's dr v supposing i 'm able to produce i think the the eyeball is the same and yet why should there be so much variation in quality and in service and that was the fundamental the challenge was that it 's a huge problem we are talking of millions of people and then and then engage with them as a partner and here is one such event here a community camp just organized by the and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses and then prescribes a line of treatment but they get glasses in the frames of their choice and that 's very important because i think glasses in addition to so they get it in about twenty minutes and those who require surgery which will transport them to and if it was not for this kind of logistics and support many people like this would probably never get services and certainly they receive surgery the following day and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from and where their families will be waiting to take them back home and this happens several thousand times each year but we looked at are we solving the problem we did a study a scientifically designed process and then to our dismay we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need so we had to do something different so we set up what we call primary eye care centers vision centers these are truly paperless offices with we kind of changed and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor the effect of this has been we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach and in this process of using technology make sure that and how much will they pay for this we fixed the pricing taking into account what they would save in bus fare and that 's good for three consultations the other challenge was how do you give high tech or more advanced treatment and care we designed a van with a vsat which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is the report goes back to the patient it gets printed out the patient gets it and then this happens because it focused on the and then by reaching the unreached we 're able to significantly grow the market so what is in this video is a surgeon operating and then you see on the other side another patient is getting ready so as they finish and then we need to do this because doing this kind of process we 're able to and then we focused on and then they really are the backbone of the organization they do almost all of with the result we have very high productivity very high quality at very very low cost so putting all this together what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else this is a very busy table but what this really is conveying is that when it comes to quality we have put in very good quality assurance systems as a result our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the and you don 't see those kind of numbers very often especially when the people can 't pay and we were helped by the market inefficiency i think that has been a big savior even now and of course one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus the result has been over the years the revenues increase at a higher level giving us a healthy margin spent about thirteen million with over a forty percent ebita we created competition for ourselves and then we we proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals the impact of this has been that these hospitals in the second year after our consultation are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology there was a time when we failed to negotiate the [ intra ocular lens ] prices to be at affordable levels so we set up and then over time we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out we believe we have about seven percent of the global market and they 're used in about 120 odd countries what we do does it have a broader relevance or is it just so to address this we what it shows is that we do roughly about sixty percent of the volume of what the uk does near a half million surgeries as a whole country and we do about both in training and in i think it is simple to say just because the u k isn 't india the difference is happening i think maybe there is the solution to the cost could be in productivity or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables or so i think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the u s and maybe obama 's i want to leave with you in conditions where the problem is very large i think the process i described you know productivity quality patient centered care can give an answer and there are many which fit this paradigm you take dentistry but i think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side now how do you create compassion now how do you make people own the problem want to do something about it there are a bit harder issues and i 'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the all that is in the world so there is no exploitation it is ourselves we are helping it is ourselves we"
