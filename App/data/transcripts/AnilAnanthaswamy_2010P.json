  "transcript": "i would like to talk today about what i think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it my own interest in this subject i had bought a copy of this book the universe and dr einstein a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle and i picked up this book thinking it would put me to sleep in ten minutes and as it happened i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at and that feeling hasn 't left me yet that feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career from being a software engineer and also the joy of communicating and that feeling also led me to a pilgrimage of sorts to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescopes detectors instruments that people are building or have built in order to probe the cosmos in greater and greater detail so it it took me from places like chile the atacama desert in chile to siberia to underground mines in the japanese alps in northern america all the way to antarctica and even to and today i would like to share with you some images some stories of these trips i have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting literally at times their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe and i first begin with a pie chart and i promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos all the theories in physics that we have today astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think that seventy three percent and most of the experiments telescopes that i went to see are in some way addressing this question these two twin i will take you first to an underground mine in northern minnesota where people are looking for something called dark matter and the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors the same experiment would be swamped by signals that could be created by ambient radio activity even our own bodies you might not believe it but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment so they go deep inside and this is actually you can barely see it and the reason for that is it 's entirely dark in there this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners who left this mine in one thousand nine hundred and sixty and physicists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s and today you would see this inside the mine half a mile underground this is one of the largest underground labs in looking for dark matter in our galaxy then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about one of them being neutrinos and neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules when a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light a flash of blue light and by looking for this blue light you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then indirectly something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino but you need very very large volumes of water in order to do this you need something like tens of megatons of water almost a gigaton of water in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino and where in the world would you find such water well the russians have this is lake baikal it is the largest lake in the world it 's eight hundred km long and what the russians are doing is they 're building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they and this is the scene that greeted me when i landed there this is lake baikal in the peak of the siberian winter the lake is entirely frozen and the line of black dots that you see in the background that 's the ice camp where the physicists are working the reason why they have to work in winter is because they don 't have the money to work in summer and spring so they wait until winter the lake so this is the russians working bring it up do any and maintenance that they need to do i still don 't understand this one russian man working in his bare chest and these people a handful of people have been working for twenty years looking for particles that may or may not exist and they have dedicated their lives to it and the toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered but they do this every year from siberia to the atacama desert in chile to see something called the very large telescope the very large telescope is one of these things that astronomers do they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively i can tell you for a fact that the next one that they 're planning is called the extremely large telescope laughter and you wouldn 't believe it but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope but nonetheless it 's an extraordinary piece of engineering and the more you understand that the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about and one piece of engineering that i want to leave you with each mirror there are four of them is made of a single piece of glass a monolithic piece of that has been ground down and polished to to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is [ to ] imagine a city like paris with all its buildings and same the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert the dry air is really good for telescopes and amazing experiments some of the most extreme experiments are being done in antarctica i was there to view something called a long duration balloon flight which basically takes telescopes and instruments all the way to the upper and that 's where they do their experiments and then the balloon the payload is brought down so this is us landing on the ross ice shelf in antarctica that 's an american c 17 cargo plane that flew us from new zealand to mcmurdo in antarctica but it says ivan the terribus the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there it 's an extraordinary place this is mcmurdo itself about a thousand people work here in summer and about two hundred in winter when it 's completely dark for six months this is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the so you 're using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of forty km and the engineers the technicians the physicists have all got to assemble on the ross ice shelf 't go into the reasons why but it 's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches and what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon the and the weather can change as they 're putting together this whole assembly those two trucks you see at the very end carry twelve tanks each of compressed helium and this particular balloon because it has to launch two tons of weight is an extremely huge balloon and if they have to pack it back they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again except when they did and do that kind of and you can see it 's a gorgeous sight here 's a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end to end so the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left hand side and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there 's a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a parachute and then the parachute is then connected to the payload sub zero temperatures they 're wearing about fifteen kg of clothing and stuff but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that and i would like to share with you a launch and the thing i want you to look at here is the telescope on the right hand side and i was struck by the juxtaposition of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has one is exploring the cosmos and what struck me was every place that i went to to see these telescopes and it was very obvious that if we destroy these silent places on earth we will be stuck on a planet without the thank you"
