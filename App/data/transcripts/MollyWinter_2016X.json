  "transcript": "whenever i get to travel for work i try to find out where my drinking water comes from and where my poop and pee go this has earned me the nickname the poo princess in my family and it 's ruined many family but thinking about where it all goes is the first step in activating what are actually superpowers in our poop and pee check out this landscape in santa fe new mexico just notice what kinds of words and feelings come to mind this landscape was watered with treated sewage water and that 's ok how we feel about this and but poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community it looks more like a park than a treatment plant the poo at the very bottom of all those layers of gravel not touching anyone is providing solid food for those marsh plants and the clean clear water that comes out the other end so even though they 're in a desert they get their own personal oasis this approach is called integrated closed loop but in this approach we 're doing one step better we 're designing for reuse from the very beginning because everything does get reused but the most important thing about this system isn 't the technicals of how it works it 's how you feel about it why not why don 't we see more innovation we want more innovation but a lot of times whole categories of innovation ones that can help us live more beautifully turn out to be illegal today 's regulations and codes were written under the assumption that best practices would remain best practices with incremental updates forever and ever but innovation isn 't always incremental how we encourage people to study our jokes our codes and it ultimately determines how innovative we can be so that 's the first the second reason is but not so here in the us we still get sick from drinking shit in our sewage water seven million people get sick every year nine hundred die annually and we 're not taking a holistic approach to making it better so we 're not solving it i can 't take echo for a swim during the rainy season because we dump raw sewage sometimes into our river our rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant too much rain and portland is not alone here forty the other bummer going on here with our status quo the other half is being incinerated or land filled and that 's a bummer to me because there are amazing nutrients in your daily doody it is comparable to pig manure we 're omnivores they 're omnivores think of your poo and pee as a health smoothie for a tree the average wastewater treatment plant can remove maybe half of the drugs that come in the other half goes right out the other side consider what a cocktail of and i want to get you so and this attitude that says we 're going to reuse this let 's design to make it beautiful as advanced potty training and there are three great reasons to enroll today number one each one of us is pooping and peeing something that could fertilize half or maybe all of our food depending on our diet and carbon if we 're getting that into the soil is going to bind to the other minerals and nutrients chemical fertilizers by definition don 't have carbon in them imagine if we could move our animal manure and our human manure imagine how much energy we could some of us are concerned about industrial pollutants contaminating this reuse cycle but we need to separate our discomfort about talking about poo and pee so we can calmly talk about how we want to reuse it and what things we don 't want to reuse and get this if we change our approach to sanitation we can start to slow down climate change and that could help slow down global warming i want to show you some brave souls who 've had the courage to embrace this advanced potty training approach so those folks in new mexico why did they do it ' cause they felt comfortable seeing what was going down the toilet as a resource this house is special because they have a composting toilet turning all their poo and over time into a soil amendment but it was allowed in five other states nearby that my organization 's first code change campaign here 's a great example where the integrated water management approach and they 're not flushing to the sewer system how well their wash water is getting reused and then once the building has thoroughly used everything aka shat in it it 's treated to highest standard right and then infiltrated into the groundwater right below and all that was cheaper than updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure so that 's the last reason we should get really excited about doing things differently we can save a lot of money i keep showing examples where everyone 's reusing everything on site why well when we look at our aging infrastructure and it is old and we look at the cost of updating it three quarters of that cost is so as we build anew as we renovate it might make more sense to treat and reuse everything on site because the amount of water they would save as a community would be so big but more importantly they felt comfortable with this idea of advanced potty training imagine if we embraced innovation for sanitation the way we have for say solar power think about it solar power used to be uncommon and unaffordable now it 's more a part of our web of power than ever before we now have sources of power like the sun that don 't vary with our earthly dramas what 's driving all that innovation it it 's cool to talk about energy some folks are even talking about the problems with the limited resources where our current energy is coming from we encourage our best and brightest to work on this issue better solar panels better batteries everything so let 's talk about where our drinking water is coming from where our poo and pee are actually going if we can get over this discomfort with this entire topic we could create something that creates our future goldmine every time you flush the toilet i want you to think where is my poop and pee going will they be gainfully employed figure out how you can communicate to those who can drive this change that you have advanced you are ready for reuse how all of you feel is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be thank you so much"
