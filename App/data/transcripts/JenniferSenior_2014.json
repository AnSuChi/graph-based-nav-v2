  "transcript": "and it was written by dr spock thank you for indulging me i have always wanted to do that no it was benjamin spock and his book was called the common sense book of baby and child care it sold almost fifty million copies by the time he died and it is amazing the variety there are guides to raising a financially savvy kid but taken why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis crisis might seem like a strong but there is data suggesting it probably isn 't there was in fact a paper of just this very name parenthood as crisis published in there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish parents experience more stress than non parents their marital satisfaction is lower there have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids and the answer often is not so great i spoke with a researcher named matthew killingsworth who is doing a very very imaginative project that tracks people 's happiness and here is what he told me he found which is better than interacting with other relatives which is better than interacting with acquaintances which is better than interacting with parents which is better than interacting with children who are on par with strangers i have been looking at what underlies these data for three years and children are not the problem something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem i don 't think we know what parenting is supposed to be parent as a verb only entered common usage in one thousand nine hundred and seventy the roles but for the rest of us it can kind of feel like a crisis so how did we get here how is it that we are all now a child rearing universe without until fairly recently sometime during the progressive era we put an end to this arrangement we recognized and school became a child 's new work but it was reciprocal we provided and moral instruction to our kids and they in return provided income kids became in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist economically worthless but emotionally priceless we began to work for them because within only a matter of decades it became clear if we wanted our kids to succeed school was not enough massive piles of homework are a kid but that 's also work for us because we have to check it about three years ago a texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart she said almost casually homework is the new dinner the middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give mothers it would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for this is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding we have no clue what portion our wisdom if any is of use to our kids the world is changing so rapidly it 's impossible to say high school specifically i was told that i would be at sea in the new global economy if i did not know it didn 't turn out that way now there is a certain kind of middle class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids mandarin and maybe they 're onto something but we cannot know for sure absent being able to anticipate the future what we all do as good parents hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills we try and teach them to be financially savvy and i was not i ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef i hold down a steady job but the presumption now is that what was good enough for it 's as if we 're doing nothing and we 're defaulting on our obligations to our kids so it 's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers now add to this problem something else we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce the writer michael lewis once put this very very well he said that the surest way way for a couple to start fighting is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs because the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this so did you catch that dave is the one who walks them to school every morning and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes mothers are much more likely to be multi tasking when they are at home and fathers when they are at home are much more likely to be and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time in fact ucla recently did a study according to the american time use survey mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers but i still think that something she wrote is highly relevant i have not been alone in the bathroom since october but here is the thing men are doing they spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them they work more paid hours on average than their wives and they genuinely want to be good involved dads today it is fathers either way by the way if you think it 's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles just imagine what it 's like now for families families with two dads families with two moms single parent households they are truly improvising as they go sweden parents could rely on the state there are unfortunately the united states is not one of them so in case you were wondering what the u s has in common with it 's this we too have no paid we are one of eight known countries that does not in this age of intense confusion and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms helicopters or drones is paramount their self esteem the one mantra no parent ever questions is all i want is for my children to be happy i think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child but it is a very elusive one happiness and teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field there 's no curriculum for it happiness and self confidence can be the byproducts of other things but they cannot really be goals unto themselves a child 's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent and happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid we are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world 's ugliness that we now shield them from sesame street i wish i could say i was kidding about this but as i did out of nostalgia you will find a warning at the beginning saying that the content is not suitable for children content of the original sesame street is not suitable for children when asked about this by the new york times a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations one was that cookie monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it bad modeling i don 't know but the thing that stuck with me is she said that she didn 't know whether oscar the grouch i cannot tell you how much this distresses me you are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the muppets hanging from her cubicle wall right there that 's my son i had had an unexpected c section but i managed to have one very clear thought i whispered it into his ear i said try so hard not to hurt you but it occurs to me now as any parent will tell you hard all of us have said or done hurtful things i think in another era and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our i 'm not really sure how to create new norms but i do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids we may be assuming the wrong wrong moral burden it strikes me as a better goal and dare i say a more virtuous one to focus on making productive kids and moral kids and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do and their accomplishments and the love that they feel from us we just follow the oldest ones in the book decency a work ethic love i think if we all did that the kids would still be all right and so would their parents possibly in both cases even better"
