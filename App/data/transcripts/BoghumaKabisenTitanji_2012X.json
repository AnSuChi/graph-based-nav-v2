  "transcript": "share with you the story of one of my patients called celine celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of cameroon in west central africa six years ago at the time of her hiv diagnosis she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time and she was very ill she told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she 'd received during the trial or even what the trial had been about i didn 't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were yet what puzzled me most yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the were left to their own devices i do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting hiv clinical trials in developing countries is bad and are much needed to address the burden of the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation especially in the context of research sadly enough the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer i 'm sure you must be asking yourselves so attractive for these hiv clinical trials well in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on population with a high incidence of new hiv infections sub saharan africa largely fits this description also research within the continent endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems a clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation less rigorous and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure as funding for hiv research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict you can see why this context very attractive the high prevalence of hiv drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels i invite you to consider four areas i think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which the first of these is informed consent now in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand and must freely consent to participate in the trial this is especially important in developing countries where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries for example it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant like the information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable the second point i would like for you to consider now this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world or should they be given an alternative standard of care such the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted it is important to assess the potential risks and benefits and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study that brings us to the third point i want you think about the review of research unfortunately this is often local governments set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and the final point i would like for you to consider tonight researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial in addition they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments i was able to get her enrolled into a free hiv treatment program and with a support group to help her cope although she may not know this my encounter with celine has completely changed the way in which i view hiv clinical trials in developing countries and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done i believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change if you are a researcher i hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience to remain ethical in your research i challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound yes there is a need for us to find a cure for hiv to find an effective vaccine for malaria to find a diagnostic tool that works for t b but i believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way"
