  "transcript": "i 'm very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about i believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope for patients who today live with devastating multiple sclerosis motor neuron disease and the numbers here are really rather staggering and the annual cost globally is because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large so the question we really need to ask ourselves is why given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual now in order to consider this i first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works so in other words i need to tell you everything i learned at medical school but believe me this isn 't going to take it 's called oligodendrocyte and when these four cells work together in health and harmony and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think to emote emote to remember to learn move feel and so on and that 's evident here with the slower conduction and i 've asked john to tell us something about what were his problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease and i 've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament what these two clips show because in just eighteen months eighteen months a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair and and let 's face it john could be anybody 's father brother or friend so that 's what happens when the motor nerve dies so the scan on your left so i know what you 're thinking here you 're thinking and all he 's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale i 've told you these diseases are terrible they 're devastating numbers are rising where 's the hope and there 's hope in this next of this brain section of somebody else with m s because what it illustrates but crucially the area that 's ringed red so it was damaged it 's now repaired just to be clear it 's not because of doctors it 's in spite of doctors not because of doctors this is spontaneous repair it 's amazing and it 's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain even and this observation is important for two reasons the first admittedly last century unlike say the bone and the second thing it does and it gives us a very clear direction of travel why do we not and that in part reflects the complexity of drug development now drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet and the odds of this bet are roughly this they 're ten thousand to one against so the question for us is can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds and in order to do that you have to think where is the bottleneck so the question is can we study these diseases using human material and of course and human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things and the challenge has long been can we harness the power the undoubted power of these stem cells and dolly was an example of the first but i think the even more significant breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today and what yamaka did in a fantastic form of scientific cookery into a master stem cell because what it means that from anybody in this room but particularly patients you could now generate a bespoke personalized tissue repair kit both to study but potentially to treat but it 's an absolute reality today and whilst we 're on the theme of hope for those of you who might have failed at school there 's hope for you as well because this is the school report of john gerdon [ i believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist on his present showing this is quite ridiculous ] so they didn 't think much of him then so to return to the original problem i think there are two ways you can think about this as a fantastic 21st century drug discovery tool and or as a form of therapy so i want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this you take a skin sample you do the pluripotent reprogramming as i 've already told you and you generate live motor nerve cells that 's straightforward because that 's what pluripotent cells can do but crucially you can then compare their behavior in the and tom maniatis and what you 're looking at and this is amazing these are living growing motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease it happens to be an inherited form i mean but crucially we can then track their individual health and when you do all that you realize that the diseased ones which is represented in the red line are two and a half times more likely to die than the healthy counterpart because what would you ask of the drugs and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that i 've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models if that makes sense it and they 're not mutually exclusive and i think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend but it 's not thought of that way just yet is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain and i 've told you that and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it that will be the future there will be drugs that will do that but the other way which is with colleagues in ucl david miller in so this study was very simple we took patients with multiple sclerosis it took five years off a lot of people but conceptually it 's essentially simple so in order to measure whether this was successful or not we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure unclear vision and so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with david miller three times twelve months six months and before the infusion and that 's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking which makes sense because their nerves are dying we then gave the stem cell infusion and repeated the measurement twice three months and six months and to our surprise almost the line 's gone up that suggests that the intervention has been protective i don 't think myself that what 's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves so this is a proof of concept i 'm very excited about that so here i 've asked john what his hopes are for the future"
