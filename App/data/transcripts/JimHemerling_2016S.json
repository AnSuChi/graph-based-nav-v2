  "transcript": "picking up an old hobby or learning a new skill for most people occupy a very positive emotional space even exhilarating i mean just take a look at some of the titles of self help books awaken the giant within practicing the power of now or here 's a great one we can all relate to how to stop doubting your greatness and start living an awesome life when it comes to but there 's another type of transformation that occupies a very different emotional space frantically searching for some place to run and hide most of us spend the majority of our waking hours involved in organizations and due to changes in globalization the reality is is our organizations are constantly having to adapt in fact i call this the era when i shared this idea with my wife nicola she said always on transformation that sounds exhausting and that may be exactly what you 're thinking and you would be right particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations the way we always have been but because we can 't hide we need to sort out two things first and second how do we fix it first of all let 's acknowledge that change is hard but there are things that organizations do that make change even harder and more exhausting for people than it needs to be first of all leaders often everything is happening in crisis mode short term but that doesn 't give any hope for the future or they 'll just take a superficial one off approach hoping that they can return back to business as usual as soon as the crisis is over this kind of approach is kind of the way some students approach preparing for standardized tests in order to get test scores to go up will end up teaching to the test but it fails the fundamental goal of education so given these obstacles what can we do to transform the way we transform organizations so rather than being exhausting it 's actually empowering and energizing to do that we need to focus on five strategic imperatives the first imperative for putting people first is to inspire through purpose most transformations have financial and operational goals these are important and they can be energizing but they tend not to be very motivating to most people in the organization to motivate more broadly the transformation needs to connect with a deeper sense of purpose take lego the lego group has become an extraordinary global company under their very capable leadership they 've actually undergone a series of transformations expanding investment and innovation it but about enabling more children to experience the joy of learning through play not surprisingly that deep sense of purpose tends to be highly motivating to lego 's people the second imperative for putting people first is to go all in layoffs in the face of relentless competition it may well be that you will have to take the painful decision to downsize the organization just as you may have to lose but losing weight alone will not get you across the finish line with a winning time to win you need to go all in you need to go all in rather than just cutting costs you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term investments to develop the leadership the third imperative for putting people first is to enable people with the capabilities that they need to succeed during the transformation and beyond over the years i 've competed in a number of triathlons you know but i do have one distinct capability i am remarkably fast at finding my bike almost all the bikes are already gone real triathletes know that each leg the swim the bike the run really requires different capabilities likewise when we transform organizations we need to be sure that we 're giving our people chronos a global recognized the need to transfer from building products software products to building software as a service first of all they invested in new tools that would enable their employees to monitor the usage of the features as well as customer satisfaction with the new service they also invested in so that their employees would be able to resolve customer service problems on the spot because of these investments rather than feeling overwhelmed by the transformation employees actually felt energized and empowered in their new roles my fourth imperative therefore is to instill a culture of continuous learning when satya nadella became the ceo of microsoft in february two thousand and fourteen he embarked on an ambitious transformation journey to prepare the company to compete in a the culture microsoft 's culture at the time was one of silos and internal competition not exactly conducive to learning nadella he rallied his leadership around his vision for a living learning culture where your role was to show up as the smartest person in the room where your role was to listen to learn and to bring out the best in people well early days microsoft employees already noticed this shift in the culture clear evidence of microsoft putting people first my fifth and final imperative is specifically for leaders in a transformation a leader needs to have a vision a clear road map with milestones and then you need to hold people accountable for results but in order to capture the hearts and minds of people you also need to be inclusive inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first and right now our basketball team is the best in the league and we 're favored to win again this year there are many explanations for this they have but one of the key reasons is their head coach steve kerr is an inclusive leader they hadn 't won a national championship since and he immediately got to work he reached out and engaged the players and the staff he created an environment of open debate and solicited suggestions during games he would often ask what are you seeing that i 'm missing the warriors were down two games to one when kerr made the decision to change the starting lineup a bold move by any measure the warriors won the game and went on to win the championship and it is widely viewed that that move was the pivotal move in their victory it wasn 't actually kerr 's idea it was the idea of his 28 year old assistant nick u 'ren because of kerr 's leadership style u 'ren felt comfortable bringing the idea forward but he implemented the idea and then the credit actions all consistent with kerr 's highly inclusive approach to leadership we owe it to to our organizations and to society more broadly to boldly transform our approach to transformation to do that we need to start putting thank you"
