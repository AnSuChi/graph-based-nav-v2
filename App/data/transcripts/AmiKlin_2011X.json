  "transcript": "always wanted to become thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them as a scientist i always wanted to measure that resonance that sense of the other that happens so quickly in the blink of an eye we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen it 's so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves so my journey in autism really started when i lived in a residential unit most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long stay hospitals this is a long they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that i am telling you about these are survival skills these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution you see babies are born in a state of utter fragility without the caregiver they wouldn 't survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival they orient to the caregiver from the first babies prefer to they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as they 're looking at people they look at people 's eyes because the eye is the window the caregiver seeks the baby and it 's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the social mind the social brain we always think about autism it doesn 't it begins with the beginning of life as babies engage with they soon realize that well there is something between the ears and that thing is called attention and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere because whatever people are looking at is and soon they start building but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction this is a and she has autism and i am coming so close to her that i am maybe two inches from her imagine if i did that to you came two inches from your face you 'd do probably two things wouldn 't you you would recoil you would call the police you would do something because it 's literally impossible to penetrate somebody 's physical space and not get that reaction we do so remember intuitively effortlessly this is our body wisdom and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal or threat well you so something that in other species are survival without which and this is what we need to simply act socially maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you well a few minutes later and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an m & m so but something a thing did now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people for this girl that division line is not so clear and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines who to be but in fact the brain also becomes who we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction and this is what 's happening with her brain well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and it 's a brain disorder it 's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born we now know that there is a very broad spectrum there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted there are those individuals who don 't talk those individuals who talk too much there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school you see them running the periphery fence all the school day if you let them but often this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time when i started in this field we thought there were four individuals with autism know it 's more like one in one hundred there are millions of individuals with autism all around us the societal cost of this condition is huge and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled individuals who need wraparound services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of sixty thousand to eighty thousand dollars a year those are individuals who did not benefit because now we know that autism creates itself as individuals diverge in that pathway of learning that i mentioned to you were we to be able to identify and intervene and treat this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life but it diminishes considerably minorities the age of diagnosis is later still the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesn 't have an impact because children with autism become adults with autism and so this is there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe there are going to be something between three hundred and six hundred genes associated with autism how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a playroom because those liabilities don 't necessarily convert into autism autism creates itself were we to be able to intervene during those years of life so how do we do that how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another person 's being i remember when i interacted with that how do you come into her world is she thinking about me is she thinking about we had to basically step inside a body we had to see the world through her eyes and so in the past many years we 've been building these new technologies that are we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with and you see there little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that we had to create these very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention you 're watching a video those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of thirty five typically developing two year olds and this is what the typical children are doing in this scan pass in green here are the children who are typical are watching this what are the children with autism doing they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting it happens moment by moment in their real lives and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized in something other we took a construct from the concept of growth charts you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and you have physical height and weight well we decided we were going to create growth charts of social engagement we sought children from the time they 're born what you see here on the they start over here they love people 's eyes and it remains quite stable it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months now let 's see what 's happening with babies who became autistic but then it 's a free fall very much like they brought into this world the reflex it 's almost as if that stimulus you you 're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives because if you interact with a two and a three month old you 'd be surprised by how social those babies are and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated what we found out is that our science identify this condition early on we didn 't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and that what we are doing now but this would be for naught if we didn 't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community the primary care physicians who see every child and we want to do that universally but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure we need to be able to work with the families support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from universal screening because those treatments now when we think about what we [ can ] do in those first years i can tell you having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities preventing in fact those experiences that i really started in my journey in this field i thought at the time that this was an we can do a great deal of things and the idea is not to cure autism that 's not the idea what we want is to make sure the profound profound isolation because after all they learn about the world almost like about it but this is a strength we want them to be free to do that we want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able well thank you for listening to me"
