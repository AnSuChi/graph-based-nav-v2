  "transcript": "so this right here is the tiny village of elle close to lista it 's right at the southernmost tip of norway he went out to see what and he thought it looked cheap out it was clearly the remains of a human being and usually so the police started searching through missing reports from the local area national missing reports and looked for accidents with a possible connection they found nothing so they ran it was an invisible life the police in norway got a message from the police in the netherlands they had found a body in an identical wetsuit and they had no idea who this person was but the police in the netherlands managed to trace the so they were then able to tell that both wetsuits were bought by the same customer but this was all they were able to figure out the customer paid cash there was no surveillance footage from the shop we heard this story and it triggered me and my colleague photographer tomm christiansen and we of course had the obvious question who were these people but it took about two or three seconds to figure out calais is basically known for two things it and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp and are because if you or i or anybody else with a firm connection to europe goes missing off the coast of france people would just know the media would know and there would be pictures of you on lampposts it 's difficult to disappear without and your family if you have any family left don 't necessarily know where you are and you 're staying here illegally and this is what happened to shadi omar it is a story about the fact that this is in calais and they 're all stuck here because and they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry or the eurotunnel most want to go to britain because they know the language and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from they want to work they want to study they want to be able to continue their lives graphic designers farmers soldiers you 've got the whole spectrum but who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants because we usually do that in and roughly four thousand are staying in calais but these are numbers and the numbers don 't say anything about who these people are where they came from or why they 're here and first i want to tell you about one of them and after a while we heard this story about a syrian man who was living in bradford in england so we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did dna samples of him the analysis concluded the body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the netherlands was actually mouaz al balkhi he was born in the syrian capital of damascus in in a middle class family and his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer who spent eleven years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in syria they said he was that kind of guy mouaz studied to become the family fled damascus and went to the neighboring country jordan their father had problems finding work in jordan and mouaz could not continue his studies so he figured ok the best thing i can do to help my family would be to go somewhere where i can finish my studies so then he decides to head for the uk where his uncle lives the city right next to calais by the english channel he must have given up all hope along with shadi kataf they both bought wetsuits and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive we have tried to figure out where shadi met mouaz but we weren 't able to do that we first heard about shadi after a cousin of his living in germany so we got in touch with him yarmouk is being described as the worst place to live on planet earth they 've been bombed by they 've been stormed by isis and they 've been cut off from supplies for years and he said they ate all the grass so there was no grass left out shadi and his sisters got out the parents are still they fled to libya shadi took up scuba diving he fell completely in love with the ocean he hoped to find work as a diver when he reached italy reality was not that easy he was living on the streets somewhere in france he calls his cousin in belgium and explains his situation he said i 'm in calais i need you to come get my backpack and my laptop i but i will go buy a wetsuit and i will swim his cousin of course tried to warn him not to but and his phone was never switched on again what was left of shadi was found nearly three months later many may think that the story about shadi but i don 't agree to me this is a story about two questions that i think we all share what is a better life and what am i willing to do to achieve it and to me and probably a lot of you a better life would mean being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful whether that be spending more time with your family and friends travel to an exotic place or just getting money to buy that cool new device or a pair of new sneakers the answers to those two questions are dramatically different it 's a life in dignity a better life means not having your house bombed not fearing being kidnapped it means being able to send your children to school go to university or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and i have no trouble imagining that after spending weeks or even months as a second grade citizen living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp with a stupid racist name like the jungle most of us would be willing to do just about anything if i could ask shadi and mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the english channel they would probably say this is worth the risk because they could no longer see any other option and but that 's the reality of living as a refugee in western europe in two thousand and fifteen thank you bruno giussani this is tomm christiansen who took most of the pictures you have seen and they 've done reporting together tomm you two have been back to calais recently this was the third trip it was after the publication of the article what has changed what have you seen there tomm christiansen the first time we were in calais it was about one thousand five hundred refugees there maybe four or five thousand people it seemed more permanent and the french government has managed to seal off the borders better so now along with the despair and and hopelessness among and continue the reporting tc yes bg anders i 'm a former journalist and to me it 's amazing that in the current climate of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility but how did you sell it to your editors anders because we weren 't able to know what we actually could figure out as soon as it became clear that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was we basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted just travel wherever you need to go do whatever you need to do just get this done bg that 's an editor taking responsibility the story by the way has been translated and published across thank you anders"
