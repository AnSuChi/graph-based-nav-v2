  "transcript": "alabama somebody 's got to be from mobile right and mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers forming this beautiful delta and the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes birds of every flavor it 's an absolute magical wonderland and i remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six i was in the gulf and i was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom it was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand it was all i could do to hold onto this amazing creature and as i looked at it raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown so i marveled for a moment and then decided it was time to release him so i put him down the octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing it landed on the the bottom in the rubble and fwoosh and i went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology and then moved to hawaii and entered graduate school the university of hawaii and while a student at hawaii i worked at the waikiki aquarium and the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays and being the spineless guy i thought well i 'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals i had been learning about as a student and bring them in and i built these elaborate sets and put them on display but they didn 't really interact with people the octopus would rise up and look at you and you 're thinking is that guy really looking at me he is looking at me and you walk up to the front of the tank then you realize that these animals all have different personalities some of them would hold their ground others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks and one in particular this amazing animal so i went right up to the front of the tank i was three or four inches from the front glass and the octopus was sitting on a perch a little rock and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass so i was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away and at that time i could actually focus anyway there we were staring at each other and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system and chk chk chk chk chk this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down he reaches up takes another armful of gravel releases it i lift an arm then he lifts another arm and i lift another arm and then i realize the octopus won the arms race because i was out and he had six left but the only way i can describe what i was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate about three years into my degree a funny thing happened on the way to the office which actually changed the course of my life a man came into the aquarium it 's a long story but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the south pacific 16 millimeter movie cameras he said make a movie about this expedition ok a couple of biologists making a movie this and i remember that proverbial light going off in my head thinking wait a minute yeah i 'll be a filmmaker so i literally came back from that job quit school hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that i didn 't know what i was doing it 's been a good ride and what i learned in school though was really beneficial if you 're a wildlife filmmaker and going out into the field to film animals especially behavior it helps to have a fundamental but where i really learned about octopus was in the field as a filmmaker making films with them where you 're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes homes i remember i took a trip to australia went to an island called one tree island and apparently evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on one tree between the time they named it and the time i arrived because i 'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there anyway one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef in fact there 's a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth twice a day rapidly and there 's a beautiful reef very complex reef with lots of animals including a lot of octopus there 's one right there but the idea is we were there for a month and i wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them so the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could every day a little closer a little closer a little closer and you knew what the limit was they would start getting twitchy and you 'd back up it was like i don 't know what that thing is but he 's no threat to me so they went on about their business and one of the most fantastic displays that i remember or at least visually and they would see and start moving over and i don 't know whether they actually saw crab in it or imagined that one might be but whatever the case they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land it was lights out and i always wondered what happened under that web and i can 't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep but whatever the case i like that it 's like nothing you 've ever done if you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one and as you go down the washing machine at the surface and it starts and as you go deeper that lovely blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue and finally it 's a rich lavender and after a couple of thousand feet it 's ink black and now you 've entered the realm of the mid water community you could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid water suffice to say though as far as i 'm concerned without question the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid water community but we 're just going to zip right past this area this area that includes about ninety five percent of the living space on our planet which i think is even more extraordinary the mid ocean ridge is a huge mountain range forty thousand miles long snaking around the they 're big mountains thousands of feet tall some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface creating islands like hawaii and the top of this mountain range is splitting apart and as these tectonic and over the tops of them is three thousand to four thousand meters of water creating enormous pressure forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at yellowstone in fact this whole area and it can no longer hold in suspension and it forms these towers these chimneys that are ten twenty thirty feet tall and all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life you 've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to ten feet long and out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes and living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals shrimp fish clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold and this whole ecosystem wasn 't even known about and it completely threw science on its head it made scientists rethink where life on earth might have actually begun and before the discovery of these vents it 's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it and it 's all so ephemeral but you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead there 's no hot water and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town an eerie spooky ghost town but essentially devoid of animals of course but and there 's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has and that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn 't really different from some of the areas that i 've seen in thirty five years of traveling around making films where and you go back and i 'm at home and i 'm thinking okay what can i shoot ah there 's no coral algae growing on it and the water 's pea soup you think well what happened and you turn around and there 's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth and over here there 's a golf course going in and this is the it 's raining like crazy here so this rainwater is flooding down the hillside carrying with it sediments from the construction site smothering the coral and killing it and fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom and there 's your pea soup but encouragingly i 've seen just the opposite i 've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay it 's beautiful it 's got living coral fish all over the place crystal clear water and you go how did that happen well how it happened is the local community enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay and the bay recovered the ocean has an amazing ability to recover if we 'll just leave it alone indeed it 's the only thing that ever has and a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay 'm a big fan of grassroots organizations i 've been to a lot of lectures inevitably one of the first questions that comes up is but but what can i do i 'm an individual i 'm one person and these problems are so large and global and it 's just overwhelming fair enough question my answer to that is don 't look at the big overwhelming issues of the world look in your own backyard look in your heart actually what do you really care about that isn 't right where you live and fix it create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same and maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map little dots on a map and in fact the way that we can communicate today where alaska is instantly knowing what 's going on in china and the kiwis did this and then over in england they tried to and everybody is talking to everyone else it 's not isolated points on a map anymore it 's a network we 've created and maybe these healing zones can start growing and possibly even overlap and good things can happen so that 's how i answer that question look in your own backyard in fact look in the mirror what can you do that is more responsible than what you 're doing now and do that and spread the word the vent community now sylvia 's ted prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could we could to set aside not pin pricks but significant expanses and it 's my hope that some of these hope spots can be in the deep ocean an area that has has historically been seriously neglected if not abused the term six comes to mind if it 's too big or too toxic for a landfill deep six it so i hope that we can also keep some of these hope spots in the deep sea but and that i do"
