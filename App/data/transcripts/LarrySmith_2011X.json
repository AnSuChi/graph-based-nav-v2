  "transcript": "i want to discuss with you this afternoon why you 're going to fail to have a great career i 'm an economist i do it 's ready for dismal remarks you 're going to fail too because goodness you 're all cheery about failing canadian group undoubtedly and then there are the i want to talk about those looking for great jobs great careers and why you 're going to matter how many times people tell you you have to pursue the greatest fascination in your life you hear it doesn 't matter how many times you download you 're afraid if you look for your passion and don 't find it you 'll feel like you 're an idiot so then you make excuses about why you 're not going to look for your passion they are excuses ladies and gentlemen we 're going to go through a whole long list your creativity in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do if you want to have for example one of your great excuses is and if i 'm lucky i 'll have a great career if not i 'll have a good career but a good career is an impossibility so that 's not going to work then j i 'm not a genius when i was five i thought i was a genius but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since fifty being completely and saying to the world i am totally completely competent is damning yourself and then of course another excuse everybody knows that people who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive a little strange hmm hmm okay you know a fine line between madness and genius i 'm not weird i 've read steven j ' s biography oh my goodness i 'm not that it 's the one mommy and daddy told me about mommy and daddy told me that if i worked you 'll have a great career doesn 't that like mathematically make sense hmm not you know what you 'll succeed the world will give you the opportunity to work really when all the evidence is to the contrary so never mind the excuses you 're trying to find your passion and what what are you trying to tell me well i have an interest i say do you have passion i have an interest you say i 'm interested in this and what about the rest of humanity 's is your greatest love passion is the thing that will what you want what you want what you want is passion it is beyond interest and then you may have found your greatest love in comparison to all the other things that interest proposed to his sweetie he was an economically rational person let us merge our interests laughter yes he did i love you gretel i love you more than all right she left the room halfway through his enumeration after he got over his surprise at being know turned down he concluded he 'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person although he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part or are you afraid of the word if you settle for interesting what the hell ever that means do you know what will happen at the end of your long life your friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery and there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone and inscribed on that tombstone it will say here lies a distinguished engineer who invented velcro but what that tombstone should have said in an alternative lifetime what it should have said if it was your highest here lies the last nobel laureate in physics who formulated the grand unified field theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive laughter velcro indeed one but then there are some of you in spite of all these excuses you will find you will find your passion because because you will have invented a new excuse any excuse to fail to take action and this i would pursue but i value i want to be a and i will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment do you really want me to say now tell you really i swear i don 't kick children look at the worldview you 've given yourself you 're a hero no matter what and i by suggesting yes there was a little kid wandering through this building when i came here and no i didn 't kick him laughter course i had to tell him the building was for adults only and to get out and i told him she 'd probably find him outside anyway last time i saw him he was on the stairs crying what a wimp but do you really think it 's appropriate that you should actually take you know what will happen someday ideal parent you the kid will come to you someday and say i know what i want to be and you know you 're going to like what comes next says your kid i have decided i want to be a magician i want you say that 's risky kid i don 't know kid you should think about that again kid you 're so good at math why don 't you the kid interrupts you and says but it is my dream it i had a dream once too but but so how are you going to finish the sentence with your but but but i was afraid to pursue it or are you going to tell him this i had a dream once kid and see your jailers when he or she said i have a dream you could have said looked the kid in the face and said just like i did but you won 't be able to say that because you didn 't so you can 't and so the sins of the parents are visited on the poor children why will you seek refuge in human relationships as your excuse you know why in your heart of hearts you know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships it is because you are you know what you are you 're afraid great friend great spouse great parent but you 're afraid and that 's why you 're not going to have a great career is also attached to that other most terrifying phrase if only i had your brain it will hurt a lot so those are the many reasons why you are going to fail to have a great career"
