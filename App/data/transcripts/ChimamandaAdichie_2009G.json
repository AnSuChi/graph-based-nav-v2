  "transcript": "i would like to tell you a few personal stories about what i like to call the danger of the single story my mother says that i started reading at the age of two i think four is probably close to the truth and what i read were british and american children 's books and when i began to write at about the age of seven stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read i wrote exactly the kinds of stories i was reading they ate apples how lovely it was that the sun had come out now this despite the fact that i lived in had never been outside nigeria and we never talked about the weather because there was no need to because the characters in the british books i read drank ginger beer never mind that i had no idea what ginger beer was what this particularly as children because all i had read were books in which characters were foreign now things changed when i discovered african books books there weren 't many of them available and they weren 't quite as easy to find as the foreign books but girls with skin the color of chocolate whose kinky hair could not form so what the discovery of african writers did for me was this it saved me from having a single story of what books are and so we had as was the norm live in domestic help who would often come from nearby rural villages so the year i turned eight we got a new house boy his name was fide and when i didn 't finish my dinner my mother would say finish your food don 't you know people like fide 's family have nothing so i felt enormous pity then one saturday we went to his village to visit and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made i was startled it had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something all i had heard about them was how poor they were so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor their poverty was my single story of them years later i thought about this when i i was nineteen my american roommate was shocked by me she asked if she could listen to was consequently very disappointed when i produced my tape of mariah carey what struck me was this she had felt sorry for me even before she saw me her default position toward me as an african was a kind of patronizing my roommate had a single story of africa a single story of catastrophe in this single story there was no possibility of africans being similar to her in any way no possibility of feelings more complex than pity no possibility of a connection as human equals i must say that before i went to the u s i didn 't consciously identify as although i still get quite irritable when africa is referred to as a country the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from lagos two days ago in which there was an announcement on the virgin flight i began to understand my roommate 's response to me and if all i knew about africa were from popular images i too would think beautiful unable to speak for themselves i would see africans in the same way that i as a child had seen fide 's family now here is a quote from the writing of a london merchant called john lok who sailed to west and kept a fascinating account of his voyage after referring to the black africans as beasts who have no houses he writes they are also people without heads having their mouth and eyes in their breasts i 've laughed every time i 've read this and one must but what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling african stories in the west a tradition of sub saharan africa as a place of negatives of difference of darkness of people who in the words of the wonderful poet who once told me that my novel was not authentically african now i was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel that it had failed in a number of places but i had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called african authenticity in fact i did not know what african authenticity was the professor told me that my characters but i must quickly add that i too am just as guilty in the question of a few years ago i visited mexico from the u s the political climate in the u s at the time was tense and there were debates going on about immigration and as often happens in america immigration became synonymous with mexicans there were endless stories of mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system sneaking across the border and then i was overwhelmed with i realized that i had been so immersed in the media coverage of mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind the abject immigrant i had bought into the single story of mexicans and i could not have been more ashamed of myself show a people as one thing as only one thing over and over again and that is what they become it is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power an igbo word that i think about whenever i think about the power structures of the world and it is nkali it 's a noun that loosely translates to to be greater than another like our economic and political worlds stories too are defined how they are told who tells them when they 're told how many stories are told are really dependent on power the palestinian poet mourid barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with and you have an entirely different i recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel i told him that i had just read a novel called american psycho obviously i said this in a fit of mild irritation but it would never have occurred to me to think that just because i had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all americans i had read tyler and updike and steinbeck and gaitskill i did not have a single story of america i began to think about how i could invent horrible things my parents had done to me my cousin polle one of my closest friends okoloma died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have and most of all a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives all of these stories make me who i am but to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me the single story creates stereotypes and the problem but that they are incomplete they make one story become the only story course africa is a continent full of catastrophes there are but there are other stories and it is very important it is just as important to talk about them the consequence of the single story is this it robs people of dignity it makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult it emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar so what if before what if my mother had told us that fide 's family was poor what if we had an african television network that broadcast diverse african stories all over the world what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls a balance of stories what if my roommate knew a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house now the conventional wisdom was that nigerians don 't read literature he disagreed he felt and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said i didn 't like the ending now you must write a sequel and this is what will happen and she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel here was a woman part of the ordinary masses of nigerians who were not supposed to be readers she had not only read the book but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified what if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the lagos hospital last week talented people singing in english and pidgin and igbo and yoruba and ijo what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband 's full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds what if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider who has just started her own business selling hair extensions or about the millions of other nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail but continue to nurse ambition but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government rather than because of it i teach writing workshops in lagos every summer and it is amazing to me how many people apply how many people are eager to write to tell stories my nigerian publisher and i have just started a non profit called farafina trust and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don 't have anything in their libraries and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops in reading and writing for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories stories matter but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize stories can break the dignity of a people but stories can also repair that broken dignity the american writer alice walker wrote this about her southern relatives who had moved to the north she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind they sat around reading the book themselves listening to me read the book and a kind of paradise when we realize that there is never thank you"
