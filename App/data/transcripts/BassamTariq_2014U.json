  "transcript": "when a friend and i opened our first ramadan fast at one of the busiest mosques in new york crowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets it was an fbi agent 's wet dream frustrated by this myopic view my friend and i had this crazy idea let 's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state each night of ramadan and share those stories on a blog we called it thirty mosques in thirty days and we drove to all the fifty ranging from the cambodian refugees in the l a projects to the black sufis living in the woods of south carolina and as thirty mosques was blossoming around the world i was actually stuck in pakistan working on a film my codirector omar and i were at a breaking point with many of our friends on how to position the but our friends kept on nudging us to comment on drones and target killings to make the film more relevant essentially reducing these people who have entrusted us with their stories into sociopolitical symbols and instead we championed the tender gestures of love and headlong flashes of youth and as these birds walk played at film festivals and theaters internationally i finally had my feet planted at home in new york and with all the extra time and still no real money my wife tasked me to cook more for us and whenever i 'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat something felt off unfortunately the majority of halal meat in america doesn 't rise to the standard that my faith calls for particularly because businesses from my own community were the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy so with emotions running high and absolutely no experience in butchery some friends and i opened a meat store in the heart of the east village fashion district and by making it there 's really nothing like it in america the unbelievable part is actually that ninety percent of our in store customers are not even muslim for many it is their first time interacting with islam on such an intimate level"
