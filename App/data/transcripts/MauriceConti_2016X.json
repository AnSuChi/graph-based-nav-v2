  "transcript": "show of hands that 's most of you over the course of the next twenty more will change around the way we do our work than has happened in the last two thousand i think we 're at the dawn of a new age in human history there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work welcome to the augmented let 's start with cognitive augmentation how many of you are augmented cyborgs i would actually argue that we 're already augmented imagine you 're at a party and somebody asks you a question even siri is just a passive the tools that we 've had have been completely passive they do exactly what we tell them and nothing more our very first tool only cut where we struck it the chisel only carves where the artist points it and even our most advanced tools do nothing in fact to date and this is something that frustrates me we 've always been limited by this need to manually push our let 's design a car and the computer shows me a car and i say no more fast looking and less german and bang the computer shows me an option laughter that conversation we 're working on it tools are making this leap from being passive to being generative generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry to come up with new designs all by themselves all it needs are your goals and your constraints i 'll give you an example in the case of this aerial drone chassis all you would need to do is tell it then what the computer does every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria millions of them it but it comes back to us with designs that we by ourselves never could 've imagined and the computer 's and by the way it 's no accident that the drone body looks just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel it 's because the algorithms are designed to work the same way evolution does but just recently we used a generative design ai to come up with this 3d printed cabin partition that 's been designed by a computer it 's stronger than the original yet half the weight and it will be flying in the airbus unlike maggie maggie 's actually smarter than our most advanced design tools what do i mean by that if her owner picks up that leash maggie knows well every time the owner picked up the leash they went for a walk and maggie did three things she had to remember what happened interestingly that 's exactly what computer scientists have been trying to get ais to do for the last sixty or so years back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two they built this computer that could play tic tac toe big deal then forty five years later in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven deep blue beats kasparov at chess two thousand watson beats these two humans at jeopardy and then a couple of weeks ago so in order to win alphago was doing what it was doing and things are moving really fast i mean consider in the space of a human lifetime computers have gone from a child 's game what 's basically happening happening is computers are going from being like spock to being a lot more like kirk right from pure logic to intuition would you cross this bridge most of you are saying oh hell no you arrived at that decision in a split second and that 's exactly the kind of intuition that our deep learning systems are starting to develop right now very soon you 'll literally be able to show something you 've made you 've designed to a computer and it will look at it and say sorry homie that 'll never work you have to try again or you could ask it if people are going to like your next song or your next flavor of ice cream or much more importantly you could work with a computer to solve a problem that we 've never faced before we could certainly use all the help we can get that 's what i 'm talking about technology amplifying our cognitive abilities so we can imagine and design things that were simply out of our i think the era of human augmentation is as much about the physical world but i 'm much more interested in this idea that humans and robots working together we set it up to help a person working in construction doing repetitive tasks tasks like cutting out holes for outlets or light switches in drywall we 're using the human for what the human is good at here 's another cool project that bishop worked on which we called the hive was to prototype the experience of humans computers and robots all working together to solve a highly complex design problem the humans acted as labor they cruised around the construction site they manipulated the bamboo because it 's a non isomorphic material is super hard for robots to deal with but then the robots did this fiber winding which was almost impossible for a human to do and then we had an ai that was controlling what 's interesting is building this pavilion was simply not possible without human laarman and his team at so robotic systems are going to help us build and make but what about our ability to sense and control these things what about a nervous system for the things that we make our nervous system the human nervous system tells us everything that 's going on around us but the nervous system of the things we make is rudimentary at best for instance a car doesn 't tell the city 's public works department that it just hit a pothole at the corner of broadway and morrison a building doesn 't tell its designers whether or not the people inside like being there and the toy manufacturer doesn 't know if a toy is actually being played with how and where and whether or not it 's any fun look i 'm sure that the designers imagined this lifestyle for barbie when they designed her laughter but what if it turns out that barbie 's actually really lonely if the designers had known what was really what 's missing is a nervous system connecting us to all of the things that we design make and use what if all of you had that kind of information flowing to you from the things you create in the real world we could actually change that and go from making people want our stuff the good news is digital nervous systems that connect us to the things we design we 're working on one project with a couple of guys down in and one of the things these guys do is build insane cars that do absolutely insane things these guys are crazy in the best way so we instrumented it with dozens of sensors and the car 's nervous system captured everything that was happening to the car we captured four billion data points all of the forces that it was subjected to we took all of that data and plugged it into a generative design ai we call dreamcatcher you get this this is something that a human could never have designed except a human did design but it was a human that was augmented by a generative design ai a digital nervous system and robots that can actually fabricate something like this the augmented age and physically and perceptually what will that look like what is this i think we 're going to see a world where we 're moving from things that are fabricated to things that are farmed where we 're moving from things that are constructed we 're going to move from being isolated to being connected and we 'll move away from extraction i also think we 'll shift from craving obedience from our things to more connectedness more dynamism more complexity more adaptability and of course the shape of things to come will be unlike anything we 've ever seen before why because what will be shaping those things is this new partnership between technology nature and humanity that to me is a future well worth looking forward to thank you all so much"
