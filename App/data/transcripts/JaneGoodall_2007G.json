  "transcript": "but we can also and i want to pick up with my talk this evening from where from where zeray left off yesterday he was talking about this amazing three year old australopithecine child and who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees and it was pretty extraordinary way back then it 's kind of commonplace now but his argument was because he 'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans and you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils from the shape of the muscle attachments something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them but what about how they behaved and of course behavior doesn 't fossilize he argued and it 's now a fairly common theory that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same then maybe those behaviors were present in the and therefore perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient ancient past well if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved so it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us in certain aspects of their behavior every chimpanzee has his or her own personality of course i gave the female has her first baby when she 's eleven or twelve thereafter she has one baby only every five or six years a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing sleeping with the mother at night we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees just as it is for us in relation to learning and young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do we know now that they 're capable of imitating behaviors that they see and we believe that it 's in this way that the different tool using behaviors that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in africa so that we can describe these as primitive culture chimpanzees don 't have a spoken language we 've talked about that they do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures many of and they swagger and they throw rocks chimpanzee society we find and these really aggressive behaviors for the most part are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group they are very territorially aggressive chimpanzees i believe more than any other living creature have helped us to understand that after all there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the study that i and these chimpanzees living their complex social lives in the wild are losing their habitats this is just one photograph from the air and it shows you the forested highlands of gombe and it was when i flew over the whole area and realized that outside the park this forest which in one thousand nine hundred and sixty had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of lake tanganyika which is where the tiny national park lies that a question came to my mind how can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees when the people living around the national park are struggling to survive more people are living there than the land could possibly support the numbers increased by refugees pouring in from burundi and over the lake from congo which we call tacare it 's now there isn 't time to go into it but it 's including things like tree nurseries methods of farming most suitable to this now very ways of reclaiming overused farmland so that within two years they can again be productive working to providing them with opportunities for about ninety five percent of all loans returned working providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school in the as women 's education improves family size drops and something 's happening for conservation what 's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these villages instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys and by the way many of the staff are now tanzanian it was a tanzanian team going into the villages it was a tanzanian team talking to the and as they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation they began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees so you 've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides stretching out into and as these villages have a better standard of life they are actually agreeing to put between ten percent and twenty percent of their land so that once again so tacare is a success we 're replicating it in other parts of africa around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure the problems in africa however as we 've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of ted are major problems there is a great deal of poverty and when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion and but the rest of the developing world and indeed everywhere what are we doing to our planet you know the famous scientist e o wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average european we need three new planets today they are saying four but we don 't have them what 's happened i mean the question here is here we are arguably the most intelligent being that 's ever walked planet earth with this extraordinary and yet we 're destroying the only home we have the indigenous people around the world before they made a major decision used to sit around and ask themselves how does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead major decisions and i 'm not particularly talking about africa here but the developed world major decisions involving millions of dollars and millions of people are often based on how will this affect the next shareholders ' meeting and these decisions affect africa the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests so i began traveling outside africa talking in europe talking in the united states going to asia and everywhere there were these terrible problems and you know the kind i 'm talking about i 'm talking about pollution air that we breathe that often the water water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we 're going to face in this century seemingly with the inability to profit from past the finally all around the world people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate the droughts are so much and who are too poor to buy food who can 't move away because the whole land is degraded and so you get desertification creeping creeping creeping as the last of the trees are cut down and this kind of thing is not just in so it wasn 't surprising to me we seem to have lost wisdom the wisdom of the indigenous people do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain and the human heart talking about it in the non scientific term and and they said more or less the same thing feel this way because we feel you 've compromised our future and there 's nothing we can do about it we have compromised their future and that led to this program we call roots and shoots which began right here in tanzania it 's symbolic roots make a firm foundation shoots seem tiny to reach the sun they can we have a choice every one of us in this room we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make it 's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well the roots and shoots groups all choose three projects it whether they 're in a city or rural as to what kinds of projects but basically we have programs now from preschool right through university with more and more adults starting their own roots and shoots groups and every group chooses between them three different recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other so one of their projects will projects will be to help the environment that we all share and woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves in our families in our communities between nations between cultures between religions and between us and the natural we cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are we not do have more than this one planet just picking one or two of the projects right here in africa that the roots and shoots groups are doing one or two projects only and as i say it so there 's no time for more roots and shoots now but and unwanted pregnancies and things like that which young people listen to better from other youth rather than adults hope that 's the question i get asked as i 'm going around the world jane you 've seen so many terrible things you 've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million at the turn of the century to more than one hundred and fifty thousand now and the same with so many other animals forests disappearing deserts where once there was forest do you really have hope yes you can 't come to a conference like ted and not have hope can you and i mean think of the technologies and i 've just been so thrilled finally to come to people talking about compost latrines it 's one of my hobbyhorses we just flush all this water down the lavatory it 's terrible and then talking about renewable energy desperately important nieces nephews do we care about their future and if we care about their and choose to make these choices with the question how will this affect the environment around me how will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up or my grandchild or whatever it is so the human brain coupled with the human heart and we join hands around the world and that 's what ted is helping so well with and google who help us and are helping us with mapping in gombe national park all of these technologies we can use now let 's link them and it 's beginning to happen isn 't it you 've heard about it this afternoon it 's beginning to happen this change see change that we must have if we care about the future and the next reason for hope nature is amazingly resilient you can take an area that 's absolutely destroyed with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate which you don 't need to because you have wood lots then in five years you can have and we 've heard about this so much in the last two days this indomitable human spirit so that people who you would think would be battered by poverty or disease or whatever can and and take their part in changing the world emerging from seventeen years of hard physical labor twenty three years of imprisonment with this amazing so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath and although people around the world tried their best was executed people like this are so inspirational people like this are the role models we need for young africans so i 'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again with everyone at ted and i hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things especially the roots and shoots program and just a last word on that the young woman who 's running this entire conference center she came up so excited with her certificate she was [ in ] roots and shoots she was in the leadership in dar es salaam she said it 's helped her to do what she and it was very very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people when they are empowered"
