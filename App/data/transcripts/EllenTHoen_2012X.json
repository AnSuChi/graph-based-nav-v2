  "transcript": "in two thousand and two a group of treatment activists met the wright brothers in the beginning of the last century had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly they also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane they were not the only ones that was this actually wasn 't so great and this was at a time that in particular the u s government was interested in ramping up so there was a bit of a conflict there the u s government decided to take action and forced those patent holders to make their patents available to share with others to enable the production of what has this got to do with this nelson otwoma a kenyan social scientist discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment he was told that a cure did not exist he heard was lethal healthy lives not so for nelson he wasn 't rich enough and not so for his three year old son who he discovered a year later also had hiv they were facing prices for cost about twelve thousand [ dollars ] per patient per year the patents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharmaceutical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those patents available when you have a patent you can exclude anyone else from making luckily those patents did not exist everywhere and indian pharmaceutical companies started to produce so called generic versions medicines and make them available available in the developing world and within a year the price had come down from ten thousand dollars per patient per year to three hundred and fifty dollars per patient per year and today that same triple pill cocktail is available for sixty dollars per patient per year and of course that started to have an enormous effect on the number of people who could afford funding became available and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very eight million people have access to antiretroviral drugs and there 's something else they also stop passing on the virus this is fairly recent science that has shown that what that means is we have the tools to break the back of all countries this is as a result of the so what india did here you see the patent practices before the world trade organization 's rules before antiretroviral drugs this is what you see today and this is in developing countries so what that means is unless we do something deliberate and unless we do something now we will very soon be faced because new drugs are developed new drugs go to market but these medicines are patented unless we do something we will soon be faced [ with ] what some have termed the treatment time bomb it isn 't only the number of drugs that are patented there 's something else that can really scare generic manufacturers away this shows you so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available you will probably choose to do something else again deliberate action is needed so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes we should be able to do something similar and we did in two thousand and ten unitaid established the medicines patent pool and this is how it works that develop new medicines but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents that can be generic manufacturers it can also be not for profit drug development agencies for those manufacturers can then sell those medicines at much lower cost to people who need access to them to treatment programs that need access to them they pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property there is one key difference the medicines patent pool is a voluntary mechanism the airplane patent holders were not left a choice whether they 'd license their patents or not they were forced to do so that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and nelson otwoma is healthy he has access nelson is a member of the expert we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines without delay become available to us give you an example in august of this year the united states drug agency approved a new the pool is already working two months later nelson 's and quite rightly so he and his son will need access to the next generation of antiretrovirals and the next throughout their lifetime so that he and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy to the medicines patent pool"
