  "transcript": "that 's johnny depp of course and that 's johnny depp 's shoulder and that 's johnny depp 's famous shoulder tattoo and he had tattooed on his right shoulder winona forever and then three years later which in fairness kind of is forever by hollywood standards and now his shoulder says wino forever laughter so like johnny depp because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were seventeen or nineteen or twenty three and regretted it by the time they were thirty that didn 't happen to me i got my tattoo when i was and i regretted it instantly and by regretted it i mean that i stepped outside of the tattoo place this is just a couple miles from here down on the lower east side and i had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of east broadway and canal street which is a great place to do it because nobody cares and this was all actually quite shocking to me because prior to this moment i had prided myself on having absolutely no regrets but i had always i made the best choice i could make given who i was then given the information i had on hand i learned a lesson from it i wouldn 't change it and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets this idea is nicely captured by this quote things without all remedy should be without regard what 's done is done and it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first something we might all agree to sign onto until i tell you who said it so this is lady macbeth basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss for feeling bad about murdering people and as it happens shakespeare was onto something here as he generally was because the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths it 's also by the way a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage so people who have damage to their orbital frontal cortex so if in fact you want to live a life free of regret there is an option open to you it but if you want to be fully functional i think you need to learn to live not so let 's start off by defining some terms what is regret so in other words regret requires two things it requires first of all agency we had to make a decision in the first place and second of all it requires and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present the more acute that regret will be so let 's say for instance that you 're on your way to your best friend 's wedding and you 're trying to get to the airport and you 're stuck in terrible traffic and you finally arrive at your and you 've missed your flight you 're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by twenty well because if you miss your flight by three minutes it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome i should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel i should have gone through that yellow light but almost came out well now within that framework we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things we have a vast body of literature on consumer and financial decisions and the regrets associated with them buyer 's remorse basically but then finally it occurred to some researchers to step back and say well okay but overall what do we regret most in life here so top six regrets the things we regret most in life number one by far education thirty three percent of all we wish we 'd gotten more of it we wish we 'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have we wish we 'd chosen to study a different topic various decisions and choices about our sense of self and how we spend our leisure time or actually more specifically how we fail to spend our leisure time the remaining regrets we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance but it turns out when you look overall at what people regret in life you know what our financial decisions don 't even rank they account for less than three percent of our total regrets so if you 're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap or company a versus company b or should you buy the subaru or the prius you know what let it go odds are you 're not going to care in five years but for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around what does that experience feel like we all know the short answer so the first consistent component of regret is basically denial i basically stayed up all night and for for the first several hours there was exactly one thought in my head and the thought was make it go away i mean it 's right up there with i want my mommy the second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment so the other thing i thought about there in my bedroom that night was how could i have done that what was i thinking we can 't identify with that part we don 't understand that part which is an intense desire to punish ourselves that 's why in the face of our regret the thing we consistently say is i could have kicked myself the fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative to perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing so it 's not that i sat there in my bedroom that night make it go away but i want to suggest that there 's also a fifth one and i think of this as a kind of existential wake up call that night in my and i thought about probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy in point the whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility in face of frankly a fairly indifferent universe this is obviously an incredibly painful experience and i think it 's particularly painful for us now in the west in the grips of what i sometimes think of as a control z culture control z like the computer command undo incredibly used to not having to face life 's hard realities in a certain sense we think we can throw money at the problem or throw technology at the problem we can and the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot sometimes instead of control z we actually and for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists and i know where of i speak because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos but first i want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we 're feeling regretful about so for instance here 's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life text relpy to all and the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing we can experience a huge range of regret can accidentally hit reply all to an email and torpedo a relationship or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work and this doesn 't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life because of course sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences either for our and in the very worst case scenario even their lives so how are we supposed to live with this and the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality if you google regret you will get eleven point five million hits the fda estimates that of all the americans who have tattoos seventeen percent of us the second way that we can help make our peace with regret is to laugh at ourselves now in my case this really wasn 't a problem because it 's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you 're twenty nine years old and you want your mommy because you don 't like your but it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets i don 't think that 's the case though all of us who 've experienced regret that contains real pain and real grief understand that humor and even black humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive it connects the poles of our lives back together the positive and the negative and it sends a little current of life back into us the third way that i think we can help make our peace which as we know heals all wounds so it 's been several years since i got my own tattoo and just want to see it all right actually you know what i should warn you you i didn 't tattoo marilyn manson 's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something when other people see my tattoo for the most part they like how it looks it but i 'll let you see it anyway so let me reassure you about some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are i got this tattoo because i spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling specifically the two things i learned about myself that i most didn 't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and simultaneously how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north and what i loved about this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image well it did but it turns out it doesn 't remind me of the thing i thought it would it reminds me constantly of something else instead it actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us and ironically i think it 's probably the single most important thing i possibly could have tattooed onto my body partly as a writer but also just as a human being here 's the thing if we have goals and dreams and we want to do our best the lesson that i ultimately learned from my tattoo and that i want to leave you with today is this we need to learn to love the flawed imperfect things that we create and to forgive ourselves for creating them it reminds us that we know we can do better thank you"
