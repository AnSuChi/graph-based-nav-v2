  "transcript": "president theodore roosevelt needed a little break from the white house so he took a train to mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called the first day of the hunt they didn 't see a single bear so it was a big bummer for everyone but the second day the dogs cornered one after a really long chase but by that point the president had given up and gone back to camp for lunch so his hunting guide and then tied it up to a tree and started tooting away on his bugle to call roosevelt back so he could have the honor of shooting and when roosevelt saw this animal tied up to the tree he just couldn 't bring himself to fire at it he felt like that would go against his code as a sportsman a few days later the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in washington it was called drawing a line in mississippi and it showed roosevelt with his gun down and his arm out sparing the bear 's life and the bear was sitting on its hind legs with these two big frightened wide eyes and little ears pricked up at the top of its head it looked really helpless like you just wanted to sweep it up into your arms and reassure it it wouldn 't have looked familiar at the time but if you go looking for the cartoon now you recognize the animal right away it and this is how teddy bear was born essentially toymakers took the bear from the cartoon turned it into a plush toy and then named it after president roosevelt teddy 's bear and i do feel a little ridiculous that i 'm up here on this stage inside that story is a more important story a story about how dramatically our ideas about the stories that we tell are dramatically changing nature for us in retrospect it feels like an obvious fit because bears are so cute and cuddly and who wouldn 't want to give one to their kids to play with but the truth is that in one thousand nine hundred and two bears weren 't cute and cuddly i mean they looked the same but no one thought of them that way were monsters bears were something that that frickin ' terrified kids the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger that people were encountering on the frontier and the federal government was actually systematically exterminating bears and lots of other predators too like coyotes and wolves these animals they were being demonized they were called murderers because they killed people 's livestock one government biologist and so we were just clearing them out of the way close to half a million wolves had been slaughtered the grizzly would soon be wiped out from ninety five percent of its whereas once there had been thirty million bison moving across the plains and you would have these stories of trains having to stop for four or five hours so that these thick living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks and so what i 'm saying is the teddy bear was born into the middle of this great spasm of extermination so this is something that i 've been really curious about in the last few years how do we imagine animals how do we think and feel about them and how do their reputations get written and then rewritten in our minds well there 's a new field a relatively new field of social science that started looking at these questions and trying to unpack the powerful and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships that we have to animals and i spent a lot of time looking through their academic journals and all i can really say is that their findings are some of my favorites include that the more television a person watches in upstate new york the more he or she is afraid of being attacked by a black bear if you show a tiger to an american they 're much more likely to assume that it 's female and not male in a study where a fake snake and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road drivers hit the snake much more often than the turtle and about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals seemed to do it on purpose likely than men to get a magical feeling when they see dolphins in the surf sixty eight percent of mothers with high feelings of entitlement and self esteem identified with the dancing cats in a commercial for purina americans consider lobsters more important than pigeons but also much much stupider wild turkeys are seen as so some of this is physical right we tend to sympathize more with animals that look like us and especially that resemble human babies so with big forward facing eyes and circular faces kind of a roly poly posture this is why if you get a christmas card from like your great aunt in minnesota there 's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it and not something like a glacier bay wolf spider there 's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals and we 're telling stories about these animals and like all stories they are shaped by the times and the places in which we 're telling them so think about that moment back in one thousand nine hundred and two again where a ferocious bear became a teddy bear what nearly a majority of people lived in cities so there was a growing distance between us was a safe space where we could reconsider the bear and romanticize it nature could only start to seem this pure and adorable because we didn 't have to be afraid of it anymore and you can see that cycle playing out again and again with all kinds of animals it seems like we 're always stuck between demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out and then when we get very close to doing that so for example this is one of probably thousands of letters and drawings that kids sent to the bush administration begging it to protect the polar bear under the endangered species act and these were sent back in the mid 2000s when awareness of climate change was suddenly surging we kept seeing that image of a polar bear stranded on a little ice floe looking really morose i days looking through these files i really love them this one 's my favorite if you can see it 's a polar bear that 's drowning and then it 's also being eaten simultaneously by a lobster and a shark this one came from a kid named fritz and he 's actually got a solution to climate change he 's got it all worked out to an ethanol based solution he says i feel bad about the polar bears i like polar bears everyone can use corn juice for cars from fritz but these kids don 't see the polar bear that way and actually they don 't even see the polar bear the way that that i did back in the ' 80s i mean we thought of these animals as mysterious and terrifying lords of the arctic and when you think about it that 's kind of the conclusion to the story that the teddy bear started telling back in one thousand nine hundred and two because back then america had more or less conquered its share of the continent we were just getting around to polishing off these last wild predators and it 's made even but you know there 's also a postscript to the teddy bear story that not a lot of people talk about we full blown craze and so by one thousand nine hundred and nine when roosevelt 's successor william howard taft was getting ready to be inaugurated the toy industry was on the hunt for the next big thing they didn 't do too well and for days in advance the big news was the menu they were going to be serving him a southern specialty a delicacy a whole opossum roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes and then sometimes they 'd leave the big tail on it like a big meaty noodle and all of a sudden taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from they were calling it the billy possum and the los angeles times announced very confidently the children of the united states will play with billy possum so from that point there was a fit of opossum fever there were billy possum postcards billy possum pins billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time there were smaller billy possums on a stick that kids could wave the life of the billy possum and what that means is that the billy possum didn 't even make it to christmastime which when you think about it is a special sort of tragedy for a toy the first well it 's pretty obvious i 'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway opossums are hideous it 's that they live these parallel lives as menaces and competitors by the time roosevelt went hunting in mississippi that and the animal that he had roped to a tree really was a symbol for all bears whether those animals lived or died now was entirely up to the compassion or the indifference of people but it also said something very unsettling so now a century later if you 're at all paying attention to what 's happening in the environment you feel that discomfort so much more intensely we and most endangered species are only going to survive if we stay out there in the landscape so we 've gone hands on and we can 't ever take our hands off we 're training condors not to perch on power lines we teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter behind little ultra light airplanes we 're out there feeding we monitor pygmy rabbits so we 've gone from annihilating species and which ones well the ones that we 've told compelling stories about the ones we 've decided ought to stick around the line between conservation and domestication the stories that we tell the endangered species act"
