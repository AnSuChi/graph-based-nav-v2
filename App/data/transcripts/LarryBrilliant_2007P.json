  "transcript": "i 'm going to try to give you and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or let me start off showing you an al gore movie that you may have seen before now you 've all seen inconvenient truth this is a little more inconvenient man extremely dangerous questions because with our present we have no idea what would happen man may be unwittingly changing the world 's climate through the waste products of his civilization due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide which helps air absorb heat from the sun this is bad well it 's been calculated a few degrees ' rise in the earth 's temperature would melt the polar ice caps tourists in glass bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of miami through one hundred and fifty feet of tropical but with life itself larry brilliant should we feel good or should we feel bad that fifty years of foreknowledge accomplished so little well it depends really on as my goals i always go back to gandhi 's talisman mahatma gandhi was asked how do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong one he said consider the face of the poorest most vulnerable human being and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that and if it will be it 's the right thing to do and if not rethink it for those of us in this room it 's not just the poorest it 's the world itself and the trends the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society who are the poorest and the most vulnerable first of all the megatrends it will cause saline it will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable as will the increasing rise of population even though we 've dodged paul ehrlich 's population bomb and we will not see twenty billion people and we consume so much that again a rise of six point five billion to nine point five billion in our grandchildren 's lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poorest and the most vulnerable that 's why they migrate to cities that 's why in june of this year we passed as a species fifty one percent of us the rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did the green revolution never reached africa sandstorms the gobi desert the we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare so humans are turning more towards animal consumption in africa last year africans ate six hundred million wild animals and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat and every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds the genomic sequences of which we don 't know their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of but we are ripe for but it has a dark side what will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next thirty years but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer last week bill clinton darfur is at its origin a resource war last year there were eighty five thousand riots in china two hundred and thirty a day that required police or military intervention most of them were about resources we are facing an unprecedented number scale of disasters some are and the newly emerging diseases may make it 's a destabilized world and unlike destabilized world in the past it will be broadcast to you on youtube you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones religious and sectarian violence and terrorism for others as we look at these trends do we become despondent or will we become energized let 's look at one case the case of bangladesh and even with global warming the dotted line shows that even if emissions the next decades will see rising sea levels a minimum of twenty to thirty inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for and it could be ten times that what will that do to bangladesh let 's take a look seventy percent of bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level 's go up and take a look at the himalayas and we 'll watch as global warming makes them melt more water comes down the deforested areas here in the tarai will be unable to absorb the effluent because trees are like straws now we 're looking down south through the kali gandaki many of you i think have probably trekked here and we 're going to cruise down and take a look at bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin and in the seas rising looking at the five major rivers looking up and let 's see this in relief a minimum of twenty to forty inches of coupled with increasing flows and take a look at this as many as one hundred million refugees from bangladesh could be expected to migrate into india and into china this is but if you look at the globe all around populated areas near the and even our own san francisco we 're all in this together this is not something that happens far away to people that we don 't know global warming is something that happens to all of us all at once we live in each other 's viral environment do you remember twenty years ago no one had ever heard of west nile fever and then we watched as westwardly do you remember it 's just the beginning unfortunately there have been thirty novel emerging communicable diseases that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last thirty years it 's more than enough reason for pessimism but now let 's look at the case for optimism human beings have always risen to the challenge you just need to look at the list of nobel laureates to remind ourselves when some probably one of you in this room which fought against the nuclear threat medicins sans frontieres and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us and our own muhammad yunus we may see the eradication of guinea worm next year there were three and a half we 've seen a new disease not like the thirty novel emerging communicable diseases this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome it 's an amazing phenomenon but they 're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did they 're not waiting until they die to create foundations certainly nothing can give you more optimism than that more reasons to be optimistic in the ' 60s and i am a creature of the we all felt that we were part of it that a better world was right around the corner that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice it 's just beginning five weeks ago a group of activists from the business community gathered together to stop a texas utility from building nine coal fired electrical plants a group of business activists gathered together to join with the republican governor in california to pass ab thirty two the most far reaching legislation in environmental history al gore made presentations in the house and the senate as an expert witness can you imagine we 're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago i would not have believed as the evangelical community has understood the desperate situation of and now four thousand churches have joined the environmental movement it is something to be greatly optimistic about the european plan is an amazing breakthrough something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the united states on protest against legislation pushing for legislation to stop global warming and on july 7th around the world i learned only yesterday there will be global live and you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air now that doesn 't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most that means that people are beginning the first step which is acting out of their own self interest but i am seeing in the major funders in care rockefeller rockefeller brothers hewlett mercy corps you guys so many other organizations but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming but for me i have another reason and you 've heard so many inspiring and i heard so many last night that i thought i would share a little bit of mine who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me it was my destiny it felt like yoda it is your destiny it should make you optimistic in the last century that 's the one that was seven years ago more than all the more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world in the summer of love when you read the biblical plague we visited every house in india searching for smallpox once every month for nearly two years in a cruel reversal after we had almost conquered smallpox and this is what you must learn and they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox they went home to die and when they did they took smallpox to ten other countries this little girl rahima banu in bangladesh when she coughed or breathed and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun thus ended a chain of transmission of history 's greatest horror"
