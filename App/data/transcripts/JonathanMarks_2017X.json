  "transcript": "when i was a barrister and human rights lawyer in full time legal practice in london and the highest court in the land still convened some would say by i met a young man who had just quit his job in the british foreign office he had gone to his boss one morning and said let 's do something about human rights abuses in china and his boss had replied we can 't do anything about human rights abuses in china because we have trade relations with china friend went away with his tail between his legs and six months later he returned again to his boss and he said this time let 's do something about human rights in burma as it was then called his boss once again paused and said oh but we can 't do anything about human rights in burma because we don 't have any trade relations with burma it was the unwillingness of his government to engage in conflict with other governments in tense discussions we are constantly told that conflict is bad that compromise is good that conflict is bad but consensus is good that conflict is bad and collaboration is good but in my view that 's far too simple a vision of the world we cannot know whether conflict is bad unless we know who who is fighting why they are fighting and how they are fighting and compromises can be thoroughly rotten if they harm people who are not at the table disempowered people whom we have an obligation to protect now you might be somewhat skeptical of a lawyer arguing about the benefits of conflict and creating problems for compromise but i did also qualify as a but it will change the way we think about major problems of public health and the environment and indeed in any free constitution than any other it is that which separates the executive and the judicial powers now the framers were not just concerned about the concentration and exercise of power they also understood the determine the constitutionality of laws nor can they hold the other branches of government accountable if they collaborate with them or enter into close relationships with them the constitution is as one famous and we the people are served when those branches do indeed struggle with each other we also know it too in the private let 's imagine that two american airlines get together and agree that they will not drop the price of their economy class airfares below two hundred and fifty dollars a ticket and we the people are harmed because we pay more for our tickets imagine similarly two airlines were to say look airline a we 'll take the route from la to chicago and airline b says we 'll take the route from chicago to dc and we won 't compete so we understand the importance of struggle to relationships between branches of government the we also understand the importance of conflict when it comes to relationships but where we have forgotten it is in the relationships we are told that these relationships are a let me give you some examples a united nations agency decided to address a serious problem poor sanitation in schools in rural india they did so not just in collaboration with national and local governments but also with a television company and with a major multinational soda company months long promotional campaign including a 12 hour telethon all using the company 's logo and color scheme this was an arrangement which was totally understandable this is profoundly problematic for the intergovernmental agency an agency that has a mission to promote sustainable living by increasing consumption of sugar sweetened beverages made from scarce local water supplies and drunk out of plastic bottles in a country that is already grappling with obesity this is the agency is sowing the seeds of another this is just one example of dozens i discovered i could also have you about the initiatives in parks in london and throughout britain involving the same company promoting exercise or indeed of the british government creating voluntary pledges in partnership with industry instead of regulating industry these collaborations or partnerships have become the paradigm in public health and once again they make so obesity becomes a problem of individual of personal behavior personal responsibility and lack of physical activity it is not a problem but governments have a responsibility to develop governments are making when they collaborate in this way with industry is that they conflate the common good you necessarily put off the table things that might promote the common good to which industry will not agree industry will not agree to increased regulation unless nor can companies agree to do certain things for example raise the prices of their unhealthy products because that would violate competition law as we 've established so our governments should not confound the common good and i want to give you another example moving from high profile collaboration to something that is below ground imagine that you purchase a plot of land not knowing the mineral rights have been sold this is before the fracking boom and shortly afterwards you discover that a gas company is building a well pad on your land that was the plight within a very short period of time they began to complain of headaches of sore throats of itchy eyes in addition to the interference of the noise vibration and the bright lights from the flaring of natural gas the newspapers went to the court and said what happened to the and it was a take it or leave it settlement the gas company said you can have a six figure sum to move elsewhere and start your lives again but in return you must promise not to speak of your experience with our company not to speak of your experience with fracking not to speak about the health consequences now i do not blame the hallowiches for accepting a settlement what i want to point the finger at is the legal and regulatory a system in which there are networks of agreements just like this one which serve to silence people and seal off data points from public health experts and epidemiologists a system in which regulators will even refrain from issuing a violation notice in the event of pollution if the landowner and the gas company agree to settle it exposes hazards to local families who remain i could share some counterexamples the case for example of the public official who sues the pharmaceutical company for concealing the fact that its antidepressant increases suicidal thoughts in adolescents i can tell you about the regulator who went after the food company for exaggerating the purported health benefits of its yogurt and i can tell you about the legislator who despite heavy lobbying directed at both sides of the aisle pushes for environmental protections these are isolated examples and they can show us i began by suggesting that sometimes we need to engage in conflict governments should tussle with struggle with at times engage in direct conflict with corporations each is capable of good and they do so either sometimes but it is the responsibility of governments to protect and promote the common good and we should insist that they fight to do so this is because governments are the guardians and it is governments thank you"
