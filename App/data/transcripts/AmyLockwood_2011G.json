  "transcript": "and i now work in international development which is the [ second ] largest country in africa in fact it 's as large as western europe but it only has three hundred miles of paved roads the drc is a dangerous place in the past ten years five million people have died due to a war in the east but war isn 't the only reason that life is difficult in the drc there are many health issues as well but in a including damien damien runs a hotel outside of kinshasa it 's a hotel that 's only open but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come joseph and christine who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms said despite the fact that donor agencies and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like and it turns out that there are three main messages used they name the condoms things like vive to live or trust show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom what is it that you think about just before you get a condom they understand this their marketing is slightly different but the imagery sure is some brands are aspirational and this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing understanding who 's the audience and for donor agencies unfortunately the audience tends to be people that aren 't even in the country they 're working 's people back home people that support their work people like these but if what we 're really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv we need to think about the customer the people whose behavior needs to change the couples the young women the young men whose lives depend on it and so the lesson is this it doesn 't really matter what you 're selling thank you"
