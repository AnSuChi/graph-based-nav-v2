  "transcript": "they obviously found this amazing tropical forest and among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before they found one species that caught their attention very quickly this species you cut the the bark you find a very dark red resin that was very good to paint and and that 's the reason why this land became land of brasil and that 's the only country in the world that has the name among other reasons apart from all those products the forest is very important for climate regulation almost seventy percent of the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the just the amazon pumps to the atmosphere this is more than what the amazon river if we had to boil water to we have in the world about four billion hectares of forests this is more or less china u s canada and brazil all together in terms of size to have an idea three quarters of that is in the temperate zone and just one quarter now we used to have six billion hectares of forest fifty percent more than what we have two thousand years ago we 've actually lost two billion hectares in the last two thousand years but in the last we lost half of that so think of this in one hundred years we lost the same amount of forest in the in two thousand years in temperate forests that 's the speed of the destruction that we are having now brazil is an important piece of this puzzle most of that in the amazon it 's the largest piece of forest we have it 's a very big large area you can see that you could fit many of the european countries there we still have eighty percent so if you go with that speed very soon we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the amazon that regulates our climate deforestation was growing fast and accelerating at the end this is two point seven million hectares it 's almost like half of costa rica so at this moment this is two thousand and three two thousand and four i and together with other teammates in the national forest department the civil society business so we came up with this now i will go through all of them one by one no just giving some examples of what we set up a system with the national space agency that could actually see where deforestation is happening almost in real time so now in brazil we have this system deter where every month or every two months we and all the revenue becomes a fund that now funds conservation projects of local communities as an endowment fund including a lot of public servants so we cut this through the bank system the slaughterhouses and so on that buy products from illegal clear cut areas they also can be liable for the deforestation so making all these connections to help to push the problem down land tenure issues it 's very important for conflicts fifty million hectares of protected areas were created which is an area now we start to see so in the last ten years deforestation came down in brazil seventy five percent so if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade it avoided of three billion tons of co2 in the atmosphere this is by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions until today as a positive action one may think that when you do these kinds of actions to decrease to push down deforestation you will have an economic impact in fact in the period as we just learned by having deforestation come down now this is all good news quite an achievement and we obviously should be very proud about that which means that every minute just we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world it i think is to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in brazil and to have that as a goal for two thousand and twenty that 's our next step now i 've always been interested in the relationship between climate change and forests first because but also forests can be a big part of the solution since that 's the best way we know to sink together with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a what we see here those brown trees these are really dead trees they are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter for many years now they don 't have the sufficient cold weather to actually control the population of this beetle and it became a disease that is so i came back with this notion that the forest is actually one of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change so i was thinking if i succeed in working with all my colleagues to actually help to stop deforestation maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change so i decided to leave the forest service the goal is very clear we but in order to get to defines that we have a budget of emissions of one thousand billion tons of so if we divide this by the number of years what we have is an average budget of eleven billion tons of running twenty kilometers or it 's one flight one way from so paulo to johannesburg or to london one way two ways two tons so eleven billion tons is twice that now the emissions today and it 's growing it 's growing and maybe it will be now we need to go down to ten by two thousand and fifty and while this happens the population will grow from seven to nine billion people the economy will grow from sixty trillion dollars in two thousand and ten to two hundred trillion dollars and so what we need to do is to be much more efficient in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita per person into something like one you have to choose and 's the exactly the same question i got when i was i think so now it 's a little bit less than thirty percent in the world sixty percent is so if we can tackle so there are five things that i think we should we should do first we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions we don 't need to all the forests to actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy that 's what we proved when we decreased deforestation and the economy continued to grow same thing second we have to move the incentives to the right place today five hundred billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels we need to measure and make it transparent where when and who is emitting greenhouse gases so which means you don 't need to go to the landline telephone before you get to the mobile phones same way we don 't need to go to fossil fuels to the one billion people who don 't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy business and civil society so to finalize i think the future is not like a fate we need to have the courage to actually change the route invest in something new think that we can actually change the route i think we are doing this with deforestation in brazil and i hope we can do it also with climate change in the world"
