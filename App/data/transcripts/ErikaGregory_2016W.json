  "transcript": "let me ask you all a question how much weapons grade nuclear material do you think it would take to level a city the size of san francisco how many of you think it would be an amount about the size of this suitcase and how about this minibus all right well actually under the right circumstances an amount of highly enriched uranium about the size of your morning latte hundreds of thousands of others would become horribly ill and parts of the city would be uninhabitable for years but you can forget that nuclear latte because today 's nuclear weapons and even a limited nuclear war involving say tens of nuclear so it 's really important that you know that right now we have over fifteen thousand nuclear weapons in the hands of nine nations and if you live in a city or near a military facility one is likely pointed right at you in fact if you live in any of the rural areas where nuclear weapons are stored globally one is likely pointed at you which means they can be launched within fifteen minutes so so i 'm going to switch gears for just a second and i 'm going to talk about my imaginary friend who i like to think of as jasmine just for a moment she and her friends think of themselves as change agents and leaders and activists i think of them as generation possible which makes sense because jasmine was born she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school for jasmine a fallout shelter is an app in the android store nuclear weapons help win games or will we spend a trillion dollars and if you 're paying any attention at all to cyberthreats or for instance if you 've read about the stuxnet virus or for god 's sake if you 've ever had an email account or a yahoo account or a phone hacked you can imagine the whole new world now if you 're paying attention to the money a trillion dollars could go a long way to feeding and educating and employing people all of which could reduce the threat of nuclear war to begin with so this is really crucial right now because nuclear weapons they 're vulnerable we have solid evidence that terrorists are trying to get ahold of them just this last spring when four retirees and two taxi drivers were arrested in the republic of georgia for trying to sell nuclear materials for two hundred million dollars they demonstrated that the black market for this stuff is alive and well and it 's really important because there have been dozens of accidents involving nuclear weapons and i bet most of us have never heard anything about them just here in the united states we 've dropped nuclear weapons on the carolinas twice one of the bombs which fell out of an air force plane didn 't detonate because the nuclear core was stored somewhere else on the plane in another case luckily the sixth one didn 't but if that 's not enough to get your attention black brant incident that 's when russian radar technicians saw what they thought was a us nuclear missile streaking towards russian airspace but at that time russian president boris yeltsin came within five minutes of launching a retaliatory nuclear attack against the united states so most of the world 's nuclear nations but consider this the treaty on the sets no specific date by which the world 's nuclear armed nations rid of their nuclear weapons when john f kennedy sent a man to the moon and decided to bring him back or decided to do both those things he didn 't say hey whenever you guys get to it astronauts and he gave us a vision but along with that vision he also tried to give us and most people don 't know this either he tried to give us a partner in the form of our fiercest cold war rival the soviet union nikita but the promise of joint innovation between these two nuclear superpowers wasn 't totally extinguished which is the year that jasmine was born and the soviet union fell these two nations engaged in a project which is that the us sent cash to the russians when they needed it most to secure loose nuclear nuclear materials and to employ out of work nuclear scientists they worked alongside american scientists to convert weapons grade uranium into the type of fuel that can be used for nuclear power instead they called it megatons to megawatts so the result is that for over twenty years our two nations so but the good news is the global community has the chance to do something just as audacious today to get rid of nuclear weapons and to end the supply of the materials required to produce them it would take a renaissance of sorts the kinds of innovation that for better or worse underpinned both the manhattan project which gave rise to nuclear weapons and the megatons to megawatts program things like a platform for international collaboration which is a forcing mechanism and a positive but it 's also an important date for another reason it 's predicted to be the advent of the singularity a new moment in human where computing and consciousness become almost indistinguishable ushering in an era of abundance and we all get to go to space on our way to becoming but the values behind their vision and the willingness to ask how might we have inspired a generation of innovators they 're working backward from the outcomes they want using the of collaborative design they 're busting through obstacles they 're redefining what we all consider possible but here 's the thing that vision of abundance isn 't compatible with a world that still relies the foundations for the 22nd century it has to be about strategies for mutually assured prosperity every day i get to meet many of them are young women which will help us overcome a critical hurdle to international disarmament or melissa hanham who is using satellite imaging to make sense of what 's going on around far flung nuclear and just won a big victory at the un last week and yet too few members of generation possible and those of us who mentor them are taking on nuclear weapons but i remember something kennedy said that has really stuck with me and that is something to the effect that humans can be as big as the solutions to all the problems we 've created no problem of human destiny he said is beyond human beings i believe that and i bet a lot of you here believe that so it 's time to commit to a date after all by two thousand surely if ever there was a global moon shot worth supporting in the face of real threats for instance north korea 's recent nuclear weapons tests which fly in the face of sanctions reasonable people disagree but the question is what 's the magic number is it a thousand is it a who should be responsible for them so it 's time we make a promise of a world in which we 've broken the stranglehold that nuclear weapons have on our imaginations in which we invest in the creative solutions that come from working backward from rather than plodding forward from a present that brings all of the mental models and biases of the past with it it 's time we pledge our resources as leaders across the spectrum to work on this old problem in new ways to ask how might we how might we make good on a promise of greater security for jasmine 's generation i truly hope you will join us thank you"
