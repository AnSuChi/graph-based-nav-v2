  "transcript": "so this is my niece her name is yahli she is nine months old yahli goes to college the jobs her parents do are going to look dramatically different they concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines machine learning is the technology that 's responsible for most of this disruption it 's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence it allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do my company kaggle operates on the cutting edge of machine learning we bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia this gives us a unique perspective on what machines can do what they can 't do and what jobs they might automate or threaten it started with things like assessing credit risk from loan applications by reading handwritten characters from zip codes machine learning is now capable of far far more complex tasks last year we issued an even more again the winning algorithms were able to match the diagnoses given by human ophthalmologists now given the right data machines are going to outperform humans at tasks like this a teacher might read ten thousand essays over a an ophthalmologist might see fifty thousand eyes a machine can read millions of essays or see millions of eyes within minutes but they can 't handle things they haven 't seen many times before now humans don 't percy spencer was a physicist working on radar during world war ii when he noticed the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar cross pollination happens for each of us in small ways thousands of times per day machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations and this puts a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate so what does this mean for the future of work future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single question to what extent is that job reducible to frequent high volume tasks and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations today they grade essays they diagnose certain diseases over coming years they 're going to conduct our audits but machines will shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by the copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers ' attention it has to stand out from the crowd business means finding gaps in the market things that nobody else is doing and it will be humans that are developing our business strategy if it does then you will stay ahead of the machines thank you"
