  "transcript": "scientists tell us that vaccines are safe public opinion polls consistently show that significant proportions of the american people don 't believe the climate is warming due to human activities so why should we believe the science well indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of pascal 's wager and his wager went like this if god doesn 't exist but i decide to believe in him maybe a few hours on sunday but if he does exist and i don 't believe in him then i 'm in deep trouble and so pascal said we 'd better believe in god or as one of my college professors said he clutched for the handrail of faith he made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind and indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties then why do they accept the claims of other scientists why do they believe each other so what i 'd like to argue is yes we should but not for the reason that most of us think we were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims the method that most of us were according to the standard model the textbook model scientists develop hypotheses well are those consequences true can we observe them taking place in the natural world and if they are true then the scientists say know the hypothesis is correct so there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this one of the most famous examples comes from the work of albert einstein when einstein developed the theory of general relativity one of the consequences of his theory was that space time wasn 't just an empty void but that it actually had so if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it starlight actually does bend as it travels around the sun this was a huge confirmation of the theory it was considered proof and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe now sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the it 's about it can 't be broken if it 's a law then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the circumstances are and all of you know of at least one example of a famous law einstein 's famous equation and that relationship is true no matter what the main problem is that it 's wrong it 's just so the first reason is a logical and i have a good example of that too again from the history of science this is a picture of the ptolemaic universe with the earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going why the ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet in fact more accurate predictions auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even be aware that they 're making so when nicolaus copernicus said actually the not the center of the universe the sun is the center of the solar system the earth moves around the sun scientists said well if that 's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the earth around the sun and so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallax if the earth is moving and we look at a prominent star let 's say sirius well i know i 'm in manhattan so you guys imagine you chose that rural life if we now make the same observation six months later when the earth has moved to this position in june we look at that same star and we see it against a different backdrop that difference that angular difference is the stellar parallax so this is a prediction that the copernican model makes astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found nothing so what happened both of which we would now say were incorrect the first was an about the size of the earth 's orbit and you see the earth 's orbit is actually quite small in fact it 's actually much smaller even than shown here and that leads to the second reason why the the third problem is simply a factual problem that a lot of science doesn 't fit the textbook model it 's actually inductive and by that we mean that scientists 't necessarily start with theories and hypotheses often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world and the most famous example of that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived charles darwin when darwin went out as a young man on the voyage of the beagle he didn 't have a hypothesis he didn 't have a theory he just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist and he started to collect data he knew that he hated medicine because the sight of blood made him sick so he had to have an alternative career path so he started collecting data and he collected many things including his famous finches when he collected these finches he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant many years later back in london darwin looked at his data again and began to develop an explanation and that explanation was the theory of scientists also often participate in modeling and how do we do that so this is a picture of henry cadell who was a scottish geologist you can tell he 's scottish because he 's wearing a deerstalker cap and wellington boots so he built this model this crazy contraption with levers and wood and here 's his wheelbarrow buckets a big sledgehammer and he created this physical model in order to demonstrate that you could in fact create patterns in rocks or at least in this case in mud that looked a lot like mountains if you compressed them from the side so it was an argument about the cause of mountains but a computer simulation is a kind of a it 's very important for thinking about causes evidence that the earth is warming warming up the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last one hundred and fifty years showing that the earth 's temperature has steadily increased and you can see in particular that in the last fifty years there 's been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade or almost two degrees so what though is driving that change how can we know what 's causing the observed warming so this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the earth 's climate so sulfate particles from air pollution and they asked the question what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life so here is the real life in black here 's the model in this light gray and the answer is it 's the answer e on that sat all of the above the only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurements is with all of these things put together including greenhouse gases and in particular you can see that the increase in greenhouse gases tracks this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last fifty years and so this is why climate scientists say it 's not just that we know that climate change is happening we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason so now because there all these different things that scientists do the philosopher paul feyerabend famously said the only principle in science that doesn 't inhibit progress is anything goes what he was saying was actually the full quotation is if you press me to say what is the method of science i would have to say but then this pushes the question back if scientists don 't use a single method and the answer is scientists judge and they judge by judging evidence scientists and this led the sociologist robert merton to focus on this question of how scientists scrutinize data and evidence and he said they do it in a way he called organized skepticism and skepticism because they do we know something this is true so despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts what we find is that actually really major changes in scientific thinking are relatively this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus and to say that at the end of the day what science is what scientific knowledge is is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized it 's not a jury of your it 's a jury of men and women with ph d s which has only two choices guilty well it might be true but we need to work more and collect more evidence or they can say it might be true but we don 't know how to answer the question and we 're going to put it aside and maybe we 'll come back to it later that 's what scientists call intractable but this leads us to one final problem well here 's the paradox of modern science but it 's not the authority of the individual no matter how smart that individual is like plato or socrates it 's the authority of the collective but a very special kind of crowd but it 's not based on any individual no matter how smart that individual may be it 's based on the collective wisdom the collective knowledge the collective work of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem scientists have a kind of culture illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence of course these people don 't really look like scientists because they 're much too happy most of us get up in the morning most of us trust our cars i 'm in manhattan this is a bad analogy so why is that why do cars work so well it 's not because of the genius of henry ford or karl benz or even elon musk it 's because the modern automobile is the product of more than one hundred years of work we benefit not just from the genius of benz and ford and musk but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all science like science itself should be based on evidence and that means that scientists have to become better communicators they have to explain to us not just what they know thank you very much"
