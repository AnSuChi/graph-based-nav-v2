  "transcript": "so if someone asked you for the three words that would sum up your reputation what would you say how would people describe your judgment your knowledge your behaviors in different situations today i 'd like to explore with you why the answer to this question will become profoundly important in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset i 'd like to start by introducing you to someone whose life has been changed by a marketplace fueled by reputation sebastian sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on airbnb more than squeak as many of you know airbnb is a peer to peer marketplace that matches the places being rented airplane hangars it 's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before now let me show you these heat maps of paris to the pink dots represent host properties and now two thousand and twelve an airbnb host on almost every main street in paris now what 's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value of all kinds of assets from skills to spaces to material possessions in ways and on a scale never possible before it 's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers this side of airbnb really hit home to sebastian last summer during the sebastian actually said to me he said thirteen former guests contacted me before my own mother this little anecdote i decided i 'm going to try and spread this into a global movement it 's about empowering people to make meaningful connections connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we 've lost somewhere along the way now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard wired in all of us they 're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the facebook age we 're literally beginning to realize rent barter or trade just about anything we 're sharing our cars on whipcar our bikes on spinlister our offices on loosecubes our gardens on landshare we 're lending and borrowing money from strangers on zopa and lending club we are trading lessons on everything where instead of consuming to keep up with the joneses but the key reason why it 's taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier of these marketplaces and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients let me give you an example meet chris lost his job unfortunately as an art buyer at macy 's and then he happened to stumble across a post about when kobe came trotting up to them and he was salivating with now later that evening the and taskrabbit was born at the time she didn 't realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking it now the way taskrabbit works is people outsource the tasks that they want doing yes there 's actually a rigorous interview process that 's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy rabbits now there 's over four thousand rabbits now the tasks being posted are things that you might expect like help with household chores or doing some supermarket runs i actually learned the other day that twelve and a half thousand loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded through taskrabbit assembling ikea furniture it 's brilliant now we may laugh but chris here is actually making up to five thousand dollars a month running errands around his life i think taskrabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids they 're just brilliant it 's amazing right that over the past twenty years we 've evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information and now we 're entering the third trust wave connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people powered marketplaces i actually came across this fascinating study by the pew center this week that revealed that an active facebook user is three times as likely as to believe that most people are trustworthy virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another face to face comes a healthy dose of caution or rather an urgent need to address some pressing complex questions how to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world do we want them to be the same how do we mimic the way trust is built face to face online how do we stop people who 've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise in a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan or the rate of a mortgage marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that sebastian and chris are good eggs and that device is reputation reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you there are over twenty pages of reviews of his work describing him as super friendly and now and interestingly what chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge in other words for superrabbits reputation has a real world value now i know what you might be thinking well this isn 't anything new just think of power sellers on ebay or star ratings on amazon just consider this five million nights have been booked on airbnb in the past six months alone million rides have been shared on capturing and correlating the trails of information that we leave in different places is a massive challenge but one we 're being asked to figure out what the likes of sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is shouldn 't they own their reputation data shouldn 't the reputation that he 's personally invested on building on airbnb mean that it should travel with him from one community to another what i mean by this is say he started selling second hand books on amazon why should he have to start from scratch it 's a bit like when i moved from new york to sydney it was ridiculous i couldn 't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history now i 'm not suggesting that the next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score people 's wants to do that but the most important thing that we have to keep in mind is that reputation is largely contextual the big challenge is i envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you when where and why your reliability on taskrabbit your cleanliness as a guest on airbnb the knowledge that you display on quora or [ unclear ] they 'll all live together in one place and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard that will paint a picture of your now this is a concept that i 'm currently researching and writing my next book on and currently define as the worth of your reputation your intentions capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces monitor and use your online reputation i realize that this concept may sound there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve but ultimately if we can collect our personal reputation we can actually control it more and extract the immense value that will flow from it also more so than our credit history we can actually shape our reputation just think of sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his now privacy issues aside the other really interesting issue i 'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts people [ who ] for whatever reason are not active online but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world how do we take their contributions to when we get it right reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power trust and influence your traditional credit history that only thirty percent of us actually know what it is will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost what we can access indeed reputation is a currency that i believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century now the interesting thing is reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption but the sources it will be generated from and its applications are far bigger than this space alone let me give you one example from the world of recruiting where reputation data will make the rsum seem like an archaic relic of the past stack overflow is basically a platform where experienced programmers can ask other good programmers highly detailed technical questions on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions this site receives five and a half thousand questions a day now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways but it 's basically by convincing their peers and it actually didn 't surprise them what they heard was that users were putting their reputation scores on the top of but the bigger principle of what 's happening behind stack overflow i think is incredibly exciting people are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built you know it 's very interesting when you talk to super users whether that 's superrabbits or super people on stack overflow or uberhosts they all talk about how having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power on stack overflow it creates a level playing field enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top on airbnb the people often become more important than the spaces it gives people control of their economic activity now at the end of my tea with sebastian he told me how on a bad rainy day when he hasn 't had a customer in his bookstore he thinks of all the people around the world who 've said something wonderful about him and what that says about him as a person and he 's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he 's built on airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life the reputation they generate"
