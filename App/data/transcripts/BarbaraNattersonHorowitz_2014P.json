  "transcript": "i got a phone call that changed my life i was cardiologist at ucla specializing in cardiac imaging the call came from a veterinarian at the los angeles zoo an elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop and the veterinarians were worried that she 'd had a stroke they asked if i 'd come to the zoo now to be north american zoos are staffed by highly qualified and i was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help i had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee evaluate this macaw and in this picture i 'm listening to the heart of a lion and this procedure which i have done on many human patients was identical with the exception of that paw i was working at ucla medical center with physicians discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments but some of the i went on rounds at ucla medical center and at the los angeles zoo and here 's what started coming into very clear focus for me physicians and brain tumors even though i studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad i had even written my senior thesis on darwinian theory learning about the so i started wondering with all of these overlaps how was it that i had never thought to ask a veterinarian or consult the veterinary literature for insights into one of my human patients ever attended a veterinary conference why was any of this a surprise every medication that we prescribe or that we 've taken ourselves or we 've given to our families has first been tested on an animal but there 's something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own now maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the you know we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees increasingly and this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans but i think there 's an even deeper reason physicians and scientists we accept intellectually that our species homo sapiens is merely no more unique or special than any other but in our hearts we don 't completely believe that i feel it myself when i 'm listening to mozart i feel that tug of human exceptionalism even as i recognize apart well i 'm trying these days what do the animal doctors know about this problem that i don 't know and might i be taking better care care of my human patient if i saw them as a human animal patient here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to fear induced heart failure around the year two thousand human cardiologists discovered emotionally induced heart failure it was described in a gambling father who had lost his life 's savings with a roll of the dice but it turns out human diagnosis nor was it uniquely human veterinarians had been diagnosing treating and even preventing have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of e r docs and cardiologists others actually cut themselves some animal patients also harm themselves there are birds that pluck out feathers but veterinarians have very specific and very effective this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self injury sometimes soon after giving birth some women become depressed and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic even harm the child and in some instances but veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin and this leads to renewed interest on the part of the mare in her foal shouldn 't this information be put into the hands of ob gyn 's and family doctors and patients unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large to explain it i 'm afraid i 'm going to have to air some dirty laundry some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not m d ' s i 'm talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists but maybe especially animal doctors of course most physicians don 't realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days and that when we go to medical school we learn everything there is to know about one species homo sapiens but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals amphibians reptiles fish and birds so i don 't blame the vets for feeling annoyed what do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species and i 'm doing this through programs like darwin on rounds at where we 're bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists and embedding them on our medical teams with our interns and where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients at cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher overies in a holstein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school in the united states and now internationally at zoobiquity conferences physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door and come together as colleagues as peers as doctors after all we humans are animals too and it 's time for us physicians to embrace our patients ' and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a approach to health because it turns out some of the best and most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren 't human and one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close grow get sick and heal"
