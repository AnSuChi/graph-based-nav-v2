  "transcript": "today i stand before you as a man who lives life to the full i was a young man who believed that jihad is to be understood in the language of force and violence i tried to right wrongs through power and aggression i had deep concerns for the suffering of others and a strong desire to help and bring relief to them i thought violent jihad was noble chivalrous and the best way to help at a time when so many of our people young people especially are at risk of radicalization through groups like al qaeda islamic state and others when these groups are claiming that their horrific brutality and violence are true jihad i want to say that their idea of jihad is wrong completely wrong then jihad means to strive to one 's utmost it includes exertion and spirituality and devotion wisdom and remembrance of god the word jihad stands for all those meanings as a whole jihad may at times within rules and limits in islam the benefit of an act must outweigh the harm or hardship it entails more importantly the verses in the koran that are connected to jihad or fighting do not cancel out the verses that talk about but now i believe that there are no circumstances on earth where violent jihad is permissible because it will lead to greater harm and turned into terrorism but i have come to understand that true jihad means striving to the utmost truthfulness human values and i went to school here my father and we were in the uk through his work in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one we were in bangladesh when everything changed neighbor against neighbor and at the age of twelve i experienced war destitution in my family the deaths of twenty two of my relatives in horrible ways as well as the murder of my elder brother wanton horrific violence senseless fascinated by and i used to visit him every week in prison and homeschooled myself i was seventeen so these experiences gave me and i had a strong desire a very keen deep desire to right wrongs and help the victims of oppression while studying at college in the uk i met others who showed me how i could channel that desire and i was radicalized enough to consider violence correct even a virtue under certain circumstances i wanted to protect the muslim afghan and i thought that that was jihad my sacred duty which would be rewarded by god i recruited i raised i confused true jihad with this perversion as presented by the fascist islamists these people who use the idea of jihad to justify their lust for power authority and control on earth a perversion perpetuated today by fascist islamist groups like state and others for a period of around fifteen years our aim was to remove the invaders to bring relief to the oppressed victims and of course to establish an islamic state a caliphate for god 's rule and i did this openly and i bore no hostility against this my country some british men and i formed a special bond with a loving and lovable kid and boys like him did menial tasks in the and they must have dreamt about a better future for him cruelly thrust upon him by the cruel circumstances of the time one day i picked up this unexploded mortar shell and i came back a few hours later to discover he was dead he had tried to recover explosives from that shell it exploded and he blown to bits by the very same device that had proved harmless to me so i started to question i also recruited bosnia and chechnya and the questions grew i came across rohingya fighters who were barely teenagers looking at me they begged me to take them away to england they simply wanted to go to school that was their dream my family my children of the same age were living at home and i couldn 't help wonder how much these young boys must have spoken to one another about their dreams for such a life victims of circumstances cynically exploited by their leaders i soon witnessed boys like them killing one another in conflicts between rival groups chechnya petty warlords got the young and vulnerable to kill one another in the name of jihad muslims against muslims not protecting anyone against invaders or occupiers not bringing relief to the oppressed cynically exploited people dying in conflicts which i was supporting in the name of jihad and it still carries on today realizing that the violent jihad i had engaged in abroad was so different such a chasm between radicalizing sending young people to fight and die as i was doing all totally wrong so i got involved in violent jihad in the mid ' 80s and by the time i finished it was in the year two thousand applauded even celebrated what we were doing in their name but by the time i learned to get out fifteen years had passed so what goes wrong and and we did not give ourselves a chance to develop a virtuous character we told ourselves we were fighting for the oppressed but these were unwinnable wars complicit in causing further misery for the selfish benefit of the a very long time i began to dare to face the truth to think to face the hard questions i got in touch with my soul what have i learned that people who engage in violent jihadism that people who are drawn to these types of but i believe such people can change they can regain their hearts and restore them by filling them with human values that heal when we ignore the realities we discover that we accept what we are told without critical reflection and we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish even for a single moment in their lives but now i began to question how i knew what i knew but i failed to give doubt doubt its rightful place this conviction that people can change is rooted in my experience my own journey i discovered i realized that islamists ' world of us and them is false and unjust through considering the uncertainties in all that we had asserted i developed a more nuanced understanding i realized that in a world crowded with variation and contradiction foolish preachers only foolish preachers like i used to be see no paradox in the myths and fictions they use so i understood the vital importance of self knowledge political awareness and the necessity for a deep so my plea today to everyone especially those who sincerely believe in hatred and violence learn to right wrongs without even attempting to justify cruel instead create a few beautiful and useful things that outlive us approach the world life with love beauty and truth in others and in the world that way we do matter more to ourselves to each other to our communities and for me to god this is jihad my true jihad thank you"
