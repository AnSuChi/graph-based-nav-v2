  "transcript": "as a little hawaiian my mom and auntie always told me stories about kalaupapa the hawaiian leper colony surrounded by the highest sea cliffs in the world and father damien the belgian missionary who gave his life for the hawaiian community as a young nurse my aunt trained the nuns caring for the remaining lepers almost a one hundred years after father damien died of leprosy i remember stories she told about traveling down switchback cliff paths on a mule while my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele all the way down to kalaupapa i was always curious about a few things first was why a belgian missionary chose to live in complete isolation in kalaupapa knowing he would inevitably contract leprosy from the community of people so susceptible to developing leprosy or mai pake but it wasn 't until high school through the human genome project that i realized i wasn 't alone in trying to connect our unique genetic ancestry to our potential health wellness and illness you see the two point seven billion dollar project promised an era of predictive and preventative medicine based on our unique genetic so to me it always seemed obvious that in order to achieve this dream we would need to sequence a diverse cohort of people to obtain the full spectrum of human genetic variation on the planet that 's why ten years later it continues to shock me knowing that ninety six percent of genome studies associating common genetic variation with specific diseases have focused now you don 't need a phd to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity and in my own searching i 've discovered that far less than one percent have actually focused on indigenous communities like myself who is the human genome project actually for just like we have different colored eyes and hair we metabolize drugs differently based on the variation in our genomes so how many of you would be shocked to learn that ninety five percent this bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust for example promising to alleviate the burden of type two diabetes that was plaguing their community only to turn around and use those exact same samples without the havasupai 's consent to study rates of schizophrenia when the havasupai found out they sued successfully for $ seven hundred thousand and they banned asu from conducting research on their reservation this culminated in a sort of domino effect with local tribes in the southwest including the navajo nation one of the largest tribes in the country putting a moratorium on genetic research now despite this history of distrust i still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research and if we don 't do something soon the gap in health disparities is going to continue to widen yet native hawaiians like myself die a full decade before so how do we ensure the populations of people that need genome sequencing the most are not the last to benefit my vision is to make genetic research more native to indigenize genome sequencing technology but what if you could sequence genomes on the fly what if you could fit a genome sequencer in your large vats of chemicals or computer monitors it allows us activating and empowering indigenous remote access to the internet but only if that 's what hawaiian people want in our space on our terms about science for the people by the people we 'll be starting with a tribal consultation resource eventually we 'd like to have our own indigenomics research institute to conduct our own experiments and educate the next generation of indigenous scientists in the end just as father damien did the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture or die"
