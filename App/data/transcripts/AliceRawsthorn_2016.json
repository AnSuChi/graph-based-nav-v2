  "transcript": "but all truly inspiring design projects have one thing in common they began with a dream and the bolder the dream the greater the design feat that will be required to achieve it this has been the case throughout history he dreamt of acquiring land riches and power through military conquest and his design skills improbable though it sounds would be essential in enabling him to do so at the time all weapons were made by hand to different specifications so if an archer ran out of arrows during a battle they wouldn 't necessarily be able to fire another archer 's arrows from their bow this of course meant that they would be less effective in combat and very vulnerable too axes shields and every other form of weaponry years his tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering all its larger richer more powerful neighbors to found the mighty chinese empire no one of course would have thought of describing ying zheng as a designer at the time why would they and yet he used design unknowingly and instinctively but with tremendous ingenuity to achieve his ends who was also not above using violence to get what he wanted and piracy was highly profitable and the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils they needed to attack their enemies so brutally that they would surrender on he even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight so they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack he flew a flag that bore the macabre symbols of a human skull and a pair of crossed because those motifs had signified death in so many cultures for centuries that their meaning was instantly recognizable even surrender or you 'll suffer easy to see why edward teach and his fellow pirates could be seen as pioneers of modern communications design and why their deadly symbol but of course with a different message her mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone who were horrified when she volunteered to work in military hospitals during the crimean war once there she swiftly realized back in britain she mounted another campaign this time for civilian hospitals and insisted that the same design principles were applied to them the nightingale ward as it is called dominated hospital design for decades to come and elements of it are still used today but it was restricted to specific roles and generally applied in pursuit of commercial goals rather than being used intuitively as florence nightingale blackbeard and ying zheng had done now among them is one of my great design heroes the brilliant and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him when he struggled to open a new bauhaus in chicago years later moholy 's ideas were as bold richard buckminster he was yet another brilliant design visionary and design activist who was completely committed to designing a sustainable society in such a forward thinking way that he started talking about the importance of environmentalism in design in the now he despite his efforts was routinely mocked as a crank by many in the design establishment and admittedly some of his experiments failed old blankets plastic sheeting just about anything that 's available at the time is one of the greatest feats of humanitarian now it was the courage and verve of radical designers like bucky and moholy that drew me to design and i could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields but i picked design because i believe it 's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life fellow ted design buffs and greatly as i admire the achievements of professional designers which have been extraordinary and immense i also believe that design benefits hugely from the originality the lateral thinking because even very basic advances in digital technology have enabled them to operate increasingly independently in or out of a commercial context to pursue cloud computing social media are giving greater freedom to professional designers where a new generation of designers are developing incredible internet of things technologies to fulfill florence nightingale 's dream of improving healthcare in countries where more people now have access to cell phones than to clean running water he 's a young cameroonian design engineer who has a adapted a tablet computer into the cardiopad a mobile heart monitoring device it can be used to monitor the hearts of patients in remote rural areas the data is then sent on a cellular network to well equipped hospitals hundreds of miles but he failed to persuade any conventional sources to give him investment to get the project off the ground he posted the idea on facebook where a cameroonian government official saw it and managed to secure a government grant for him because there are many other inspiring and enterprising designers who are also pursuing extraordinary projects and i 'm going to finish by looking at just a few of them then there 's gabriel maher who is developing a new design design language to enable us to articulate the subtleties of our changing gender identities without recourse to traditional stereotypes all of these designers and we all stand to benefit"
