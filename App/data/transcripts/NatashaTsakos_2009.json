  "transcript": "love theater i love the idea that you can transform become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective i love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen the idea that in comes together at that moment we transcend space and time together theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination and our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers our ability to imagine makes us and began developing upwake upwake tells the story of zero a modern day business man going to work with his life in a suitcase stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two i wanted upwake to have the same audiovisual qualities if antoine de saint exupery the author of the little prince were here he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you was inside because if you look closely enough things will begin to appear this is not a box these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space i wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist go from one world to another in a second simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas at the beginning of the show for example zero deejays dream and reality technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition on stage so today i would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology let 's start with technology all right let 's start with theater all all the four surfaces of the stage which i interact with there are no special effects in upwake no artifice it 's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal three hundred and and here are some excerpts moon new show that we 're now beginning to tour and in i was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon when i arrived at one of the schools i certainly did not expect this i was a little nervous performing without animation costume really and make up but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn 't seen the kids that attentive and i think the reason why is that i was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another something happened along the way zero became a person not just a character in a play zero does not speak it 's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box if you 're a bit extraordinary it 's as though you made something resonate within them it 's as though the mystery of the person they 're interacting with and connecting because through your mask they let theirs go being is an art form i know theater can improve the quality of people 's lives and i know theater can heal i 've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years i have seen sick kids and sad parents i know theater unites us zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow tell various stories through different and zero wants to go to the moon in two thousand and seven zero launched a green campaign suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity fifty three to eight zero p m the idea is simple basic it 's not original and it 's important to participate it 's and emotion it 's information it 's happening there is a revolution in the way that we think in the way that we share and the way that we express our stories our evolution this is a time of connection and creative collaboration charlie chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music silence humor he gave entertainment and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most"
