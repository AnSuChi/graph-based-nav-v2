  "transcript": "nasa 's kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars indicating that earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us kepler 's data reveals planets ' sizes together this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky like the terrestrial planets in our own solar system and also how much light they receive from their parent sun in turn this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not at the same time as we 're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades planetary scale environmental changes that we have set in motion i study planetary habitability as by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet you could say that i look for choice alien real estate now as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe i can tell you that the more you look for planets like earth each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet consider our neighbor mars mars is small and rocky and though it 's a bit far from the sun it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like kepler indeed it 's possible that mars was habitable in the past and in part this is why we study mars so much our rovers like curiosity across its surface scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it trying to understand how mars might have lost its past habitability but though these martian vistas resemble the deserts of our own home world places that are tied even in the driest highest places on the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests i worry i worry that this excitement about colonizing mars and other planets carries with it a long dark shadow the implication and belief by some that mars will be there to save us from the self inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of the earth as much as i love interplanetary exploration i deeply disagree with this idea there are many excellent reasons to go to mars but for anyone to tell you that mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats are not opposed to one another no they 're in fact two sides of the same goal to understand preserve and improve life into the future the extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas they 're just closer to home perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it i leave you with a final thought experiment fermi 's paradox many years ago the physicist enrico fermi asked that given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it we should have found evidence for alien life by now so where are they well one possible solution to fermi 's paradox is that as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with it is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together if we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of mars for human habitation"
