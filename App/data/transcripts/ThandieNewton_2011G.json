  "transcript": "and it 's given me but i don 't think that we 're born with one well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly it 's like that initial stage is unformed primitive it 's no longer valid or real and at some point in early babyhood the idea of self starts to form our little portion of oneness is given a name is told all kinds of things about itself and these details which go towards building ourselves our identity but the self is a projection based on other people 's projections is it who we really are or who we really want to be or should be so this whole interaction and my panic and the confusion that came from my self being rejected created anxiety and hopelessness which kind of defined me for a long time but in retrospect the destruction of my self was so repetitive that i started to see a pattern but another one would evolve sometimes and how many times would my self have to die before i realized that it was never alive in the first place and my mom is black was rooting around for definition and trying to to plug in because the self likes to fit to see itself replicated to belong we can 't hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity of success my hair wasn 't right my history wasn 't right my self i was a noticeable nobody another world was opening up around this time performance and dancing i would put all my emotional expression into my i could be in the movement in a way that i wasn 't able to be in my real life in myself i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was acting and it felt so good it was the first time that i existed inside a self one that i controlled that i steered that i gave life to but the shooting day would end and but still searching for definition i applied to read anthropology at university dr phyllis lee and and i said skin color so biology genetics she said because thandie that 's not accurate because there 's actually more genetic difference between a black kenyan and a black ugandan than there is between a black kenyan and say a white because we all stem from africa so in africa there 's been more time to create genetic diversity in other words race has no basis in biological or scientific fact but what was credible what is biological and scientific fact is that we all stem from africa that feeling of otherness i had a degree from cambridge i still look at the industry for but it 's not 's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection and that thing is oneness our essence the self 's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it 's connected to its creator to you and to me and that can happen with awareness awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self hood for a start we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves and my self is suspended in those moments i 'm connected to everything the sounds the energy from the audience all my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel that feeling of oneness and when i 'm acting a because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and no matter how other these selves might be related and i honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self i always wondered why i could feel others and the fact that i could feel others ' meant that i had nothing of myself to feel the thing that was a source of shame and when i realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function a funny thing happened i stopped giving it so much authority i 've become i respect my self and its and over time i 've tried to live and if you can do that incredible things happen i was in congo in february dancing and celebrating with women who 've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways destroyed because other brutalized psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land if we 're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life then we 're devaluing and desensitizing life destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war so here 's a note to self the cracks have started to show in our constructed world and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks and rivers of it crucially we haven 't been figuring out how to live in oneness we 've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other billions of each other only we 're not living with each let 's live with each other we knew it from the day we were born let 's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness it 's more a reality than the ones our selves have created imagine what kind of existence we can have appreciate the privilege of life and marvel at what comes next thank you for listening"
