  "transcript": "and and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach why are we doing this there are three important reasons the first is it 's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society and i think that it is a key step in evolution the second reason is we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge it 's like a noah 's ark it 's like an archive and the drugs that are used today i think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders and here at ted for the first time i 'd like to share with you how we 're addressing one theory there are many theories one theory of how the brain works and projects this version of the universe like a bubble all around us now this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries the reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble and so what we do is we compare the buildings and what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our and you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep blocking your receptors and you cannot make a decision so while you 're trying to make up your mind what the doctor the surgeon is doing while he 's hacking away at your body he 's long gone he 's at home having tea what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions thousands of decisions about the size of the room the walls the height the objects in this room ninety nine percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes it is what you infer so i can say therefore you are now we can speculate and philosophize this but we don 't actually have to for the next hundred years we can ask a very concrete question can the brain build such a perception does it have the substance to do it and that 's what i 'm going to describe to you today it had to improve it a little bit it had to add to the frontal part so that you would have instincts because they had to cope on land it 's a new brain you needed it the mammals needed it because they had to cope with so you can think of the neocortex actually it 's the pinnacle it 's the final product that the universe has produced it was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons to produce this almost frightening organ structure and it has not stopped its evolutionary path in fact the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed you discover that it 's made up of little modules g5 processors like in a computer but there are about a million of them and the brain started to fold in on itself and that 's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted we 're just packing in columns so you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano grand piano each of these neocortical columns would produce a note you stimulate it it produces a symphony now of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys it 's also you may be born lucky where you know how to master your neocortical column and you can play a fantastic symphony in fact there is a new theory of autism called the intense world theory which suggests that the neocortical columns are they are highly reactive and but you can also understand and you will have symptoms of disease so the holy grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column and perhaps to even also understand physical reality it 's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest but it 's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication the rules of connectivity because the neurons don 't just like to connect with any neuron neurons we came across and once you have that you can actually begin to build the neocortical column and here we 're coiling them up but as you do this what you see is that the branches intersect and at each of these intersections they can form a synapse and a synapse is and these synapses together form the network and when you think of the fabric of the brain the structure how is it built what is the pattern of the carpet every neuron is it 's the same in the forest every pine tree is different you may have many different types of trees but every pine tree is different and in the brain it 's the same so there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours so it 's very unlikely that you got the same fabric the same circuitry so how could we possibly create a reality that we can and when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change of how the circuitry is designed does not it may have different types of neurons different morphologies of neurons we actually do share and we think this is we make it come alive with equations a lot of mathematics we also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information and when they get to the synapse what they do is they effectively literally shock and we 've got the mathematics to describe this process so we can describe the communication between the neurons there literally are only a handful so you need ten thousand laptops so where do you go you go to ibm and you get a supercomputer because they know how to take ten thousand and fire it up and see what happens take the magic carpet for a ride and this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation it 's the first when you look at that the first time you think my god how is reality coming out of that but in fact but we can ask where is the rose we can ask where is it inside if we stimulate it with a where is it inside the neocortex ultimately it 's got to be there if we stimulated it with it so the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons ignore the synapses and look just at the raw electrical activity because that is what it 's creating it 's creating electrical patterns saw these neocortical column and it 's these electrical objects that are holding all the information about it 's like a veritable universe"
