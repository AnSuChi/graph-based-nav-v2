  "transcript": "and that is why do we and other animals have brains not all species on our planet have brains so if we want to know what the brain is for let 's think about why we evolved one and that 's completely wrong and that 's to produce adaptable and complex movements there is no other reason to have a brain think about it but apart from that gestures writing sign language they 're all mediated through contractions of your muscles so it 's really important to remember that sensory memory and cognitive processes are all important but they 're only important to either drive or suppress future movements there can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose now for those who don 't believe so once you don 't need to move you don 't need the luxury of that brain and this animal is often but that 's a different subject so but we can look at how well doing by thinking about how well we 're doing building machines which can do what humans can do think about the game of chess how well are we doing determining what piece to move where if you pit garry kasparov here when he 's not in jail against ibm 's deep blue well the answer is ibm 's deep blue will occasionally win and i think if ibm 's deep blue played anyone in this room it would win every time that problem is solved picking up a chess piece dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board if year old child 's dexterity against the best robots of today the answer is simple the child wins easily there 's no competition at all now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard one reason is a very smart five year old could tell you the but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution but let me show you cutting edge robotics now a lot of robotics is very there is now we can compare this to and this is her getting the world record in real time we have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that and that 's what we 'd like to know so in my group what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement and it sounds like an easy problem you send a command down it causes muscles to contract your arm or body moves and you get sensory feedback from vision from skin from muscles and so on so the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard station you wanted to hear that was the noise so for example if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback similarly when you put motor output on movement output it 's extremely noisy forget about trying to hit the bull 's eye in darts just aim for the same spot over and over again you have a huge spread due to movement variability now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce so if you 're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars now what i want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability and it 's more recently a unifying way to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty so let 's think about the inference but we 're going to represent beliefs with probabilities so we 're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one and the key idea to bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference you have data and that 's effectively prior knowledge you accumulate knowledge throughout your life in so let me give you an intuitive example play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you ' rule tells you there but you know that your senses are not perfect and therefore there 's some variability of where it 's going to land shown by that cloud of red representing numbers between zero point five and maybe zero point one that information is available in the current but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis and that 's that the ball doesn 't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match now both these and that 's my belief so it 's the optimal way of combining information now i wouldn 't tell you all this if it wasn 't that a few years ago we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills and what it means is we really are bayesian inference machines as we go around and i want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback so you send a command out but you can imagine looking inside the brain and here 's inside the so as you send a movement command down you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate it predicts the same thing well why would i bother doing that imagine as i shake the ketchup bottle someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me now there 's good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events because external events so one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction which is only based on your movement commands with the reality any discrepancy i 'm making predictions of what i should get subtracting them off everything left over is external to me clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person and so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling it 's been known for a long time you can 't tickle yourself as well as other people can simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense so we can bring the experiments of the 21st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem and in effect what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot and they 're going to move that back and forward and then we 're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things including ticklishness i 'll show you just one part of our study and we replay that to the other hand either no time delay in which case light would just tickle your palm or with a time and as we go from naught to zero point one second it becomes more ticklish as you go from zero point it 's equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything now i have to admit these are the worst studies my lab has ever run and in the intervening years i had two daughters and one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys they get into fights which started with one of them doing something to the other the other retaliating it quickly sometimes they would both say to me and we hypothesize based on the tickling study that when one child hits another they generate the movement they predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off so they actually think they 've hit the person less hard than they have rather like the tickling so we decided to test this in the lab now we bring in two adults we tell them they 're going to play a game and so here 's player one and player two sitting opposite and the game is very simple and that player 's been told remember the experience of that force and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject 's finger through a force transfuser and they do and what we see in all pairs of subjects is this so it re shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts so we 've made inferences we 've done tasks are symbolic i want to drink i want to dance but the movement system has to contract six hundred muscles in a particular sequence and there 's a big gap between the task and the movement so it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways so think about just a point to point movement i could choose these two so if i take some dots and set them in motion with biological motion your brain 's circuitry would understand instantly what 's going on now this is a bunch of dots moving you will know what this person is doing whether happy sad old young a huge amount of information if these dots were cars going on a racing circuit you would have absolutely no idea what 's going on so why is it that we move the particular ways we do so what is it about a movement which is good or bad imagine i want to intercept this ball here are two possible so what i can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if i choose that and the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise and one intuition to get is so i hope i 've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement and it 's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that and hopefully if we understand how we control movement we can apply that to robotic technology thank you very much that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about the the dreaming the yearning the falling in love and all these things are a kind of side show an accident you only need to store things which are really going to effect movement ca where does movement play in this game dw so people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision and it uses it very differently once you think about"
