  "transcript": "want to talk a little bit today about labor and work when we think about how people work and the moment we give them money we can direct them to work one way we can direct them and we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like at the same time if you think about it there 's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing no they are full of misery in fact it 's all about frostbite and having difficulty walking and difficulty breathing and if people were just trying to be happy the moment they would get to the top they would say terrible mistake i 'll never do it again people go down it suggests that we care about the fight it suggests that there 's all kinds of other things that motivate us and for me personally i started thinking about this after a student came to visit me this was and he came one day back he sent his powerpoint presentation to his boss and his boss wrote him back and but the merger is canceled now at the moment when he was working he was actually quite happy but knowing that nobody would so i started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor and to start with we created a little experiment in which we gave people legos and we asked them to build with legos and for some people we gave them legos and we said hey and they built with these legos this time for $ two point seven and when they finished we asked them do you want to build another one it for me and we told them that at the end of the experiment we will take all these bionicles and we will use it for the next participant this other condition was and you can think about this as also if you look at and when the prisoner is finished they ask him to fill the hole back up there 's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating the second condition of this experiment that 's exactly what we did they built it then we asked them do you want to build another one for $ two point seven we took apart the one that they just finished and when they finished that we said would you like the first thing that happened was that people and by the way we should point out that this was not big meaning people were not curing cancer or building bridges people were building bionicles for a few a few cents but even the small meaning made a difference now we had another version of this and we asked them to predict what the result would be people predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude people who were just given the description of the experiment in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more bionicle so people understand that meaning is important they just don 't understand the magnitude of the importance the extent to which it 's important there was one other piece of data we looked at and you would speculate that the people who love legos would build more legos even for less because after all they get more internal joy from it and the people who love legos less would build less legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower and the amount of legos people built in that condition the correlation was zero there was no relationship between the we basically eliminated it soon after i finished running this experiment i went to talk to a big software company in seattle i can 't tell you who they were but they were a big this was a group within the software company that was put in a different building and they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company and i stood there in front of two hundred of the most depressed people i 've ever talked and i asked them i said how many of you now show up to work later than you used to and everybody raised their hand i said how many of you now go home earlier than you used to everybody raised their hand i asked them how many of you now add not so kosher things and then i asked them i said what could the ceo have done to make you not as depressed and they came up with all kinds of ideas they said the ceo could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do he could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts but the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation if the ceo just like our participants thought the essence of meaning everything will be okay but if you understood how important meaning is and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other that was the task scan it from and put it on the pile next to them in the third condition the experimenter got the sheet of paper and they basically stopped these efforts and this is basically the result we had before you shred people 's so in fact in the shredder would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder or somewhere in the middle the bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost ignoring gets you a whole way out there the good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done scanning it and saying uh huh the bad news is that so there is a store in the and ikea is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble i don 't know about you but every time i assemble one of those it takes me much longer it 's much more effortful it 's much more confusing i put things in the wrong way i can 't say i enjoy those pieces i can 't say i enjoy the i seem to like those ikea pieces of furniture more than i like other ones so when they started cake mixes in the ' 40s put it in the oven and voila but it turns out they were very unpopular people did not want them and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that maybe the taste was not good no the taste was great it was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say here is my cake no it was somebody else 's cake as if you bought it in it didn 't really feel like your own so what did they do they took the eggs and the milk out of the powder laughter now now everything was fine and they built something that was really quite ugly nothing like a frog or a crane but then we told them look this origami really belongs to us you worked for us but i 'll tell you what we 'll sell it to you how much do you want to pay for it and the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers and what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami but i know that nobody else would love it and everybody love it as well which one of those two is correct turns out the builders not only loved the origami more they thought that everybody would see the world in their view they thought everybody else would love it more as well so for some people we gave the same task for some people we made it harder by hiding the at the top of the sheet we had little diagrams of how you fold origami for some people we just eliminated that so now this was tougher what happened well in an objective the origami now was uglier it we saw the same thing builders loved it more evaluators loved it less when you looked at the hard instructions the effect was larger why because now the builders loved it even more because in reality it was even uglier than the first version of course this tells you something about how we evaluate things now how much would you sell your kids for your memories and associations and so on most people would say for a lot a lot of money on good days just before you leave if you 're interested they 're for sale how much would you pay for them now and this is because our kids because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection by the way if you think ikea instructions good what about the instructions that come with kids those are really tough we don 't see that other people don 't see things our let me say one last comment he gave an example of a pin factory production can increase tremendously and indeed this is a great example and the reason for the industrial revolution and efficiency karl marx on the other hand said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important but if you do one step every time maybe you don 't care as much i think that in the industrial revolution and now we 're in the knowledge economy you can ask yourself what happens in a knowledge economy i think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort attention caring how connected they feel to are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on all of a sudden but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it meaning creation challenges ownership the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them how do we create our own meaning pride motivation and how do we do it in our workplace and for the thank you very much"
