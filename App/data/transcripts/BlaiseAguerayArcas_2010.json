  "transcript": "who also gave a talk here at ted in two thousand and seven on virtual earth brought me over to become the architect of bing maps which is microsoft 's and we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that that one is used to so the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning which if you 're familiar at all with seadragon that 's where it comes from not just about it 's also about imagery so as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city like virtual view at forty five degrees this can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3d structure of the city all the facades we see this space this three dimensional environment as being a canvas on which all sorts are really just one of them if you click on on this you 'll see some of the ones that we 've put out just in the past couple of months since we 've launched so for example a couple of days after the disaster in haiti we had this wonderful one which i don 't have time to show you is taking blogs in real time and mapping those stories those entries i 'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff so these little green bubbles i 'm not going to dive into them but photosynths are integrated into the map everything that 's cased in blue is an area where we 've taken imagery on the ground as well and so when you fly down thank you when there 's just as much three dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of of the three dimensional city from above so if i click on then the fact that that transition looks as it does is a function of all of that geometry all of that 3d understanding behind this model now i 'll show you a a fun app that we 've we 've been working on a collaboration georegistered imagery and uses photosynth like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery so i 'm not sure if that 's the one i actually meant to pull up but and these photos are all taken at different so that 's the flickr photo that 's our imagery into the map itself there are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them of course is time travel and i 'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery but what 's what 's cool about this is that not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with and that 's something that i 'll be showing you more of in just a moment now i just made a transition indoors that 's also interesting ok notice there 's now a roof above us we 're inside and this is something that we 're able to do with a backpack camera so we 're now but we 're also imaging not only of of still images but also of video so this is something that we 're now going to try all right there we go so these are our friends in pike place market because i want to show points of interest no no the other way yeah yeah back to the corner back to the corner i don 't want to see you if you 're actually on the spot you can think about this this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality let me just take a moment and thank the team they 've done a fantastic job of and while i while i walk outside i 'll just mention that here we 're using this for telepresence but you can equally well use this on the spot for augmented reality when you use it on the spot it means that you 're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you so here we 're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it that was being broadcast by the way on a all right and now there 's one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years and that 's curtis wong worldwide telescope so we 're going to head over to the dumpsters where it 's traditional after a long day at the market to go out for a break but also stare up at the sky this is the integration of worldwide telescope into our maps current if we scrub the time then we can see how the sky will look at different times and we can get all of this very detailed information about let 's move the moon a little higher in the sky maybe change the change the date i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon so this is an astronomically complete representation of the of the sky integrated right into right into the earth all right now i 've overrun my time so i 've got to stop thank you all very much"
