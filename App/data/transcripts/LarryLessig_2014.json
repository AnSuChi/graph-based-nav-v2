  "transcript": "deep in the code of the srt algorithm to calculate intermediate quotients necessary for iterative floating points of divisions i don 't know what that means but it 's what it says on wikipedia there was a flaw and the probability was one out of every three hundred and so intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every twenty seven thousand years the community the techies said this flaw has to be addressed they were not going to stand by quietly as intel gave them these chips so there was a revolution across the world people marched to not really exactly like that but they rose up and they demanded that intel fix the flaw and intel set aside four hundred and seventy five million dollars to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw so billions of dollars in our society was spent to address a problem which would come once out of every three hundred you 're familiar with his poetry around the height of the nazi period he started repeating the verse first they came for the communists and i did nothing then they came for the jews and then they came for there was no one left to speak for me now niemller is offering a certain kind of insight this is an insight at the core of intelligence we could call it 's a certain kind of test can you recognize an underlying threat and respond can you save yourself or save your kind turns out ants are pretty good at this cows not so much so can you see the pattern can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it number two number three a boy this is my friend aaron swartz he 's tim 's friend he 's friends of many of you in this audience aaron came to me with a question it was just before i was going to give my first ted talk i was so proud i was telling him about my talk laws that choke creativity and aaron looked at me and was a little impatient and he said so how are you ever going to solve the problems you 're talking about copyright policy internet policy how are you ever going to address those problems so long as there 's this fundamental corruption in the way our government works not my field he said as a citizen now he asked questions you have got to get a clue because there is a flaw at the core of the operating system of this democracy and it 's not a flaw every one out of three hundred and sixty billion times our democracy tries to make a decision it is every time every single important we 've got to end the bovinity of this political society we 've got to adopt it turns out the word is now if you know aaron swartz you know that we lost him it was about six weeks before i gave my ted talk and i was so grateful to chris that he asked me to give this ted talk not because but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression i couldn 't begin to describe the sadness because i had to focus i began to yearn for a less sterile less academic way to address these issues the issues that i was talking about because the primary in new hampshire is so incredibly important it was a group called the new hampshire rebellion that was beginning to talk about how would we make this issue of this corruption central in two thousand and sixteen but it was another soul that caught my imagination a woman she started in los angeles and began to walk to washington d c with a single sign on her chest that said campaign finance reform she arrived in washington with hundreds following her including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her now i don 't have thirteen months and a wife who it turns out still hates when i 'm not there for mysterious reasons so this was not an option but the question i asked could we remix granny d a bit what about a walk not of three thousand two hundred miles but of one hundred and eighty five miles across new hampshire in january the anniversary of aaron 's death we began a walk that ended on january 24th the day that two hundred people joined us across this walk as we went from the very top to the very bottom of new hampshire and what was astonishing to me something i completely did not expect to find was the passion and anger that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue we had found in a poll that americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics now politicians and pundits tell you there 's nothing we can do about this issue americans don 't care about it but the reason for that is that ninety one percent of americans think there 's nothing that can be done about this issue and but because at least ninety one percent of us believe we can 't we don 't leap you begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility you give ' em a chance a way to think and hope is the one thing that we aaron 's friends failed him with because we let him lose and i 'm not going to fail that i 'm not going to fail that that sense and we 're going to fight for however impossible this battle looks what 's next well we started with this march with two hundred people and next year there will be one thousand on different routes that march in the month of january and meet in concord and granny d walkers across the country will be marching for this reform number one number two on this march one of the founders of thunderclap david and he said well what can we do and so they developed a platform which we are announcing today that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform regardless of where you are in new hampshire or outside of new hampshire you can sign up and directly be informed where the candidates are are on this issue so you can decide who to vote for as a function of which is and then finally number three the hardest we 're in the age of the super pac indeed yesterday merriam announced that we 're going to try an experiment we 're going to try a launching of what we can think of as a super pac to end all super pacs and the basic way this works is this for the last year we have been working with analysts and political experts to calculate how much would it cost to win enough votes in the united states congress to make sort of because you can 't use kickstarter for political work but anyway kickstart sort of first a bottom up campaign where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals and when those goals have been reached we will turn to the large dollar contributors to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of super pac necessary to win this issue to change the way money we will celebrate two hundred and eighteen representatives in the house and sixty senators in the united states senate so we heard about wishes here 's my wish may the ideals of one boy unite one nation behind one critical idea that we are one people we are the people who were promised a government a government that was promised to be dependent upon the people alone the people who as madison told us meant not the rich more than and then may you but because if you are you are aaron asked me that now i 've asked you"
