  "transcript": "since then the internet has transformed the way we communicate the way we do business and even the way we live and we add to this online information and each time we send an email now collectively this tells a lot and in many ways even what we 're so your data can and will outlive you what has happened is that we 've largely lost control over our data and also our privacy so this year as the web turns twenty five it 's very important for us to take a moment we have to really think we but actually what we 've also lost is the idea of privacy itself twenty years from now the word ' privacy ' is going to have a completely different meaning from what it means to you and and i believe there is let 's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today email and the process was quite simple you would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper then you would place it into a we 're not sending a letter what you are sending in many ways is actually a postcard and it 's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can the most basic solution is to use encryption and the idea is quite simple first you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it so the way we fix this problem is actually and then you make sure the server doesn 't actually have the keys this seems like common sense we see that the business model of the internet today really isn 't compatible with privacy advertising is one hundred and thirty seven billion dollars and to optimize the ads that are shown to us they need to know where we live how old we are what we like what we don 't like if we want to have privacy online what we have to do is we 've got to go out and get it ourselves the only solution was something known as pgp was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech savvy and this actually is part of the problem because if you think about communication by definition it involves having someone to communicate with so while pgp does a great job of what it 's designed to do and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry i think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community what when the edward snowden story came out several colleagues and i decided to see if we could make this happen which collides protons by the way we were all scientists so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our but even better than this is that every day between twelve and these guys basically know the answers to everything so it was in this environment that we began working we actually need a combination of technology and also design so how do we go about doing so what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer so there 's an rsa private key and an rsa public key so here we have bob and alice who want to communicate privately so what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves bob 's computer and one of the tricks is we encrypt it using the public key from alice now this encrypted data is sent through the server to the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to alice which is to get the message from bob to alice without the server being able to read what 's going on the reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this and that 's actually the key design challenge how do we take all this complexity i think with protonmail we have gotten pretty close to doing this so let 's see how it works in practice here we 've got bob and alice again who and all the key encryption and generation is happening automatically in the background as bob is creating his account so he fills in his information and then after that all he has to do is click send and just like that without doing anything different from how he writes email today bob has just sent an encrypted message what we have here it doesn 't have to be disruptive if we change the goal from maximizing ad revenue to protecting data we can actually make it accessible protecting privacy but can you actually do this without the tons of money that advertisements give you we 've reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is and when you have that anything is possible our community of users got together so this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal we can also leverage the world it 's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward so what do we have to do to solve this problem well we actually need to build a new internet we have to build an internet the movement to protect people 's privacy and freedom online is really gaining momentum there are dozens of projects from all around the world who are working together to improve our privacy these projects protect things from our chat to voice communications also our file storage our online search our online browsing and these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising but they 've found support really from the people from private individuals like you and i from all over the world this really matters because ultimately and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros it 's actually a lot more than that it 's our lives our personal stories also our hopes and our aspirations we can work together to turn this vision into a reality"
