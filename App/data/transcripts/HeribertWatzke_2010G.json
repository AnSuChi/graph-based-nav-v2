  "transcript": "but it 's a technology so pervasive so invisible to take it into account when we talked about human so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please also on the balcony do you see any canine teeth laughter count dracula teeth in the mouths of your neighbors of course not because our dental anatomy is actually made not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours is made for a diet sounds like fast food food transformation made us what we are we talk about ourselves as omnivores i would say we should call ourselves coctivors so cooking is a very important technology it 's technology i don 't know how you feel but i like to cook for entertainment and you need some design so cooking is a very important technology because it allowed us to acquire what brought you all here this wonderful cerebral cortex we have because brains are expensive those have to pay tuition fees know you now our brain is two to three percent of the body mass but actually it uses twenty five percent of the total energy we use it 's very so this ingenuity of our ancestors to invent invisible everyone of us does it every day so to speak cooking natural selections our environment could develop so if we think about this unleashing human potential which was possible why is it always do and don 'ts and it 's good for you it 's not good for you i think the good news for me would be if we could go back and talk about the unleashing the continuation of the unleashing of human potential now cooking allowed also that we became a migrant we walked out of africa two times nothing can happen to you because whatever you find you will try to transform it it keeps also your brain working easy and simple transform it and it gives you a good very easy accessible energy this technology affected two organs but the gut actually shrunk okay it 's not obvious to be honest so because of having cooked food it 's easier to digest as you know is a big advantage because you can actually influence your environment you can influence your own technologies you have invented you can continue but how did it actually run this show how did it actually interfere what kind of you know we have up to five tastes three of them sustain us otherwise your electric body will not work and two tastes which protect you which are against but we use them still in a sophisticated way think about bittersweet chocolate or think about the acidity of yogurt wonderful mixed with strawberry fruits so we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing because we know that in cooking we can transform it to the form reward this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements and something which maybe you don 't like now how did the gut actually participate in this development and the gut is a silent voice it 's going more for feelings i use the euphemism digestive comfort actually it 's a digestive discomfort which the gut is concerned with so my story is a tale of two brains because it might all the managers in the room say you don 't tell me something new because we know gut feeling this is what we are using they do speak with each other and make decisions what it means to have a brain there is that not only the big brain has to talk because now if there 's a gut brain we should also learn to talk with this brain now one hundred fifty years ago anatomists described very very carefully and within this structure you see these two pinkish which penetrate actually the muscle penetrate the defending your body it penetrates the mucosa this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you now if you think about the gut the gut is if you could stretch it forty meters long the length of a tennis court if we could unroll it get out all the folds and so on it would have four hundred meters of surface and now this brain takes care over this to move it with the muscles so if we give you a specification this brain which is autonomous have five hundred million nerve cells one hundred million neurons so around the size of a cat brain so there sleeps a little cat optimizes whatever it digests it has twenty different neuron types it 's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain where you have one hundred billion neurons it senses the food it knows exactly what to do it senses it by chemical means very importantly by mechanical means because it has to move the food it it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery which actually digests the now how do the two brains work with each other i took here a model from robotics it 's called the subsumption architecture what it means is that we have a layered control system the lower layer our gut brain has its own goals digestion defense and we have the higher brain but subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower it can replace or it can so if we take two types of signals a hunger signal for example it 's sent to the brain says go and eat you have stop signals we have up to eight stop signals they are not listened to so what happens if the big brain integration despite generating a healthy hunger signal the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut the more usual case it actually takes the signal and changes it and we continue even [ though ] our eight signals would say stop enough we have transferred enough energy now the interesting thing is that along this lower layer layer this gut the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested but digestible could penetrate this we found from bariatric surgery that then the so now back to the cooking question and back to the design we have learned now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain cannot ignore it then we would generate something all of us would like to have a balance between the hunger and the satiation now i give you from our research a very short this is fat digestion you have on your left an olive oil droplet and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes this is an in vitro experiment they go away because they [ were ] absorbed actually what happens is that a very intricate structure which is water this whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil now if we could take this language and this is a language of structures and make it that it can go through the how can we actually and this might sound trivial now to you how can we change cooking how can we cook so what we have actually it 's not an omnivore 's dilemma we have a coctivor 's opportunity because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward quite sophisticated to cook to please ourselves to satisfy ourselves if we add the matrix if we add the structure language which we have to learn when we learn it then we can put it back and around energy we could generate a balance which comes out from our really primordial operation so to make cooking really a very important element i would say even philosophers have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking is thank you very much"
