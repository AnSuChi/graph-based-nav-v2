  "transcript": "when a facebook page i anonymously created helped spark the egyptian revolution but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings the same tool that united us to topple dictators i would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism and talk about some of the challenges have personally faced and what we could do about them in the early we escaped our frustrating political realities and lived a virtual life just like many of them i was completely apolitical until two thousand and nine it felt like i was not alone in june two thousand and ten internet changed my life forever while browsing dead body of a young egyptian guy his name was khaled and i decided to do something i anonymously created a facebook page and called it we are all khaled said in just three days the page had over one hundred thousand people fellow to stop i recruited my co admin abdelrahman mansour we were crowdsourcing ideas from the people we and sharing news that the regime did not want egyptians to know it had more fans than established media organizations and even top celebrities egyptians on social media were wondering if tunisia did it why can 't we posted an event on facebook and called it a revolution against corruption injustice and dictatorship i posed a question to the three hundred thousand users of the page at the time of january it 's a national holiday if one hundred thousand of us take to the streets of cairo no one is going to stop us i wonder if we could do it in just a few days the invitation reached over a million people and over one hundred thousand people confirmed attendance social media was crucial for this campaign it helped a decentralized movement arise and it made it impossible for the regime to stop it at the time they didn 't even understand it and on january 25th calling for change breaking the barrier of fear then came the the government must be planning a massacre tomorrow i lost my balance and fell down to find four armed men surrounding me one covered my mouth and the others who started looking for me in hospitals police stations and even after my disappearance a few of my fellow colleagues who knew i was the admin of the page told the media about my connection with that page and that i was likely arrested by state security my colleagues at google started a search campaign trying to find me and three days later mubarak egyptians lived a utopia for eighteen days during the revolution they all shared the belief that we could actually live together despite our egypt after mubarak would be for all but unfortunately the post revolution events we failed to build consensus and the political struggle led to intense polarization social media only amplified that state by facilitating the spread the environment was purely toxic the polarization reached its peak between the two main powers the army supporters and the islamists after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation i stayed silent for more than two years and i used the time to reflect on everything that happened it became clear to me that while it 's true that polarization primarily driven by our human behavior social media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact pick a fight or ignore someone that you don 't like but because of technology acting on these impulses is only one click away there are five critical challenges facing today 's social media rumors that confirm people 's biases are now believed and spread among millions of people we create our own echo chambers we tend to only communicate with people that we agree with third online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs all of us probably know that it it became really hard to change our opinions and once we do that it lives forever on the internet and we are less motivated to change these views even when new evidence arises fifth and in my point of view this is the most critical today our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements posts over discussions it 's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other but this is not just about egypt polarization is on the rise in the whole world rather than part of the problem no one could argue against that but i know for a fact if i write a post that is more sensational but what if we put more focus on quality what is more important the total number of readers of a post you write or who are the people who have impact that read what you write rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time or reward people for reading and responding to views that they disagree with or probably even reward that and that becomes part of our social media we also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms to fact check widely spread online information and reward people who take part in civility and mutual understanding i teamed up with a few friends started a new project trying to find answers and explore possibilities our first product is a new media platform for conversations we don 't claim to have the answers gun control the refugee debate relationship between islam and terrorism these are conversations that matter at least one out of three people but part of this internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior i believe thank you very much"
