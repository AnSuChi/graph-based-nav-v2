  "transcript": "how many times have you been told that real substantial change isn 't possible i propose to you today that apathy but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way i 'll give you some examples of what i mean let 's start with city hall you ever see one of these before this is a newspaper as you can see it 's impossible to read you need to get halfway down to even find out which address they 're talking and then further down in tiny 10 point font to find out how to actually get involved never happen but that 's not dominating the visual and mental environment the problem with this model is there the media plays an important role in developing our relationship with but even when they do talk about important political issues they do it in a way that i feel discourages engagement i 'll give you an example the now magazine from last week it 's an article about a theater performance and it starts with basic information about where it is in case you actually want to go and see it after you 've read the article where the time the website same with this it 's a movie review an art review a book review where the reading is in case you want to go a restaurant then you get to their but no information no follow up no websites for the campaigns no information about when the debates are where the campaign offices are here 's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign the message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat maybe read a book maybe see a movie but not be engaged in their community you might think this is a small thing but i think it 's important because it sets a tone and it it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport heroes how do we view leadership look at these ten movies what do they have in common you have to save the world and then they go off and save the world because they 've been told to with a few people tagging along this helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about a heroic effort is a collective as long as we 're teaching our kids it 's about following your own dreams uninvited with others to make those dreams come true political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics instead they 've become sadly uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear and people can smell that and it feeds cynicism charitable status groups who have charitable status in canada aren 't allowed to do advocacy this is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced especially during election time which leads us to the last one which is our elections as you may have noticed our elections in canada are a complete joke we use out of date systems that are unfair and create random results canada 's currently led by a party that most canadians didn 't actually want how can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don 't count in canada you add all this up together and of now i 'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what 's in our way quite the opposite i actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care but that as i said we live in this in this environment where all these obstacles are being put as long as we believe that people our own neighbors are selfish but we can change all those things i mentioned we can open up city hall we can reform our electoral systems we can democratize our public spaces my main message is but as a complex web of cultural barriers reinforces disengagement and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles then anything is possible thank you"
