  "transcript": "telling you or showing you the people who started [ jet propulsion lab ] when they were a bunch of kids they were kind of very imaginative very adventurous as they were trying at caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more naturally they blew up a shack and caltech you know in here one of them who part of a cult which was not too far from here on orange grove and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals and trying to figure out which ones were the best up this one i thought i 'd show you guess which one is a jpl employee in the heart of this crowd i tried to come like him this morning but as i walked out then it was too cold and i said i 'd better put my shirt back on but more importantly the reason i wanted to show this picture look where the other people are looking and look where he is looking wherever anybody else looks look somewhere else and go do something different you know you know put on my wall in my office and it says do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail that 's my recommendation to all of you look what everybody is doing what they are doing go do something completely different don 't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing because that doesn 't get you very far you know as you can see one of our parties you know a few years ago but then and here we made one hundred eighty degrees change you know exploring space on so you see on the bottom that rocket was supposed to go so that 's what we call the misguided missile but then also just to celebrate that we started an event at jpl for miss guided missile so we used to have a celebration every year and select there used to be competition and parades and so on you know these days so we do something a little bit more that 's more on the play side and on the right side that 's the rover just before we finished its testing but i said i 'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind beware of safety is an instrumental rock band it branches on more the experimental side there 's the improvisational side of jazz there the music 's half of me but the other half i landed probably the best gig of all i work for the jet propulsion lab i 'm building the next mars rover some of the most brilliant engineers i know are the the way i think about it is fairly somehow thirteen billion years ago there was a big bang and you 've heard a little bit about you know the origin of the universe but somehow what strikes everybody 's imagination or lots of people 's imagination somehow all that started from that big bang so the question is how did that we started from those next time you are really depressed look in the mirror and you can look and say hi i 'm looking at a star here you can skip the dust part and the reason mars takes particular attention it 's not very far from us you know it 'll take us only six months to get there six to nine months at the right time of you know if you don 't take the oceans into account it has polar so it 's very similar to some extent and you can see some of the features and that 's mount olympus on mars which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet and if you look at the height of it and you compare it give you an idea of how large that mount olympus you know is relative to mount everest and activity is going on as we speak today because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it and you can see what 's below the surface so this is called victoria crater which is about a few football fields in size and if you look at the top left you see a little teeny dark dot this picture was taken from an orbiting satellite and we actually saw the rover on the surface and we actually used the combination of the satellite images and the rover to actually conduct science because we can observe large areas and then you can get those rovers to move around and the reason is many of you went to the grand canyon and you see in the wall of the grand canyon you see these layers ten million years ago one hundred million years ago and you get deposits on top so what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall it 's kind of but we really made sure we tested those rovers before we got them down well here we are four years later and they 're still working now you say charles you are really lying to us and so on but that 's not true we really believed they were going to last ninety days or one hundred days because they are solar powered so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface and after a while we wouldn 't have enough power you know to keep them warm and that 's what we found out it turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on mars as you are seeing here and when the dust devil comes over the rover it just cleans it up it is like a brand new and now we designed them reasonably well but that 's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing you know one of them one of the wheels is stuck is not working one of the front wheels so what we are doing we are driving it backwards and the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint you know it 's not working very outside the science community about about these rovers so i thought i 'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these rovers are being viewed by people other than than the science community so let me go on the next short video this video is pretty accurate of it looks like i could have told but one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region you know and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding and we wanted to find out and we see all kinds of glacial features on it so we wanted to find out actually what is that ice made of and could that have embedded in it some organic and that spacecraft will land seventeen days seven hours so it 's on may twenty five and as you can see this is a picture the spacecraft put on mars but i thought that just in case you 're going to miss that show you know in seventeen days i 'll show you kind of a little bit of what 's going to happen video that 's what we call the seven minutes of actually heat them and look what gases will come from it so this was launched about nine months ago we 'll be coming in at twelve thousand miles per hour and in seven minutes we have to stop and touch the surface very softly so we don 't break the first mission that 's going to try to land near the north pole of mars and it 's the first mission that 's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet lynn craig where there tends to be water at least on earth there tends to be life and so it 's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet surface of mars and our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell eb looks kind of like an ice cream cone more or less bc and on the front of it is this heat shield this saucer looking thing that has about a half inch of essentially what 's cork on the front of it which is our heat shield now this is really special cork and this cork is what 's going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we 're about to experience rob grover friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft the friction when it 's flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down bc from this point we 're going to decelerate from twelve thousand five hundred miles an hour down to nine hundred miles an hour eb the outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the sun rg the temperature of the heat shield can reach two thousand six hundred degrees fahrenheit eb the inside doesn 't get very hot it probably gets about room temperature this window of opportunity within which we can deploy the parachute eb if you fire the ' chute too early the parachute itself could fail the fabric and the stitching could just pull apart and that would be bad bc in the first fifteen seconds after we deploy the parachute we 'll decelerate from nine hundred miles an hour to a relatively slow two hundred and fifty miles so we jettison the heat shield exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of mars lc after the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far phoenix really is from the ground to where we want to be but that last one percent as it always seems to be is the tricky part eb now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it 's going to get rid of its parachute bc we separate from the lander going one hundred and twenty five miles an hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of mars three thousand two hundred feet that 's like taking two empire state buildings and stacking them on top of one another eb that 's when we right itself and then earth and mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from mars to get to earth and edl itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes so by the time you even hear from the lander that edl has started it 'll already be over eb we have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely bc edl is this immense technically challenging problem it 's about getting a spacecraft that 's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of mars at zero miles an hour it 's this immensely exciting and challenging problem hopefully it so we are in the process as we speak of actually designing the next rover that we are going to be sending to mars so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you kind of the steps so we have to study all you know an efficient and we really love being close to the art center because we have as a matter of fact one of the alumni from the art center eric nyquist design or spacecraft design room just to get people to think wildly this is a playground for adults where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different then we get a little bit more serious so we have what we call our cad cams and all the engineers who are involved or scientists who are involved who know about thermal properties know about design know about atmospheric parachutes all of these things which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent so to see does that meet the requirement that we need on the right also we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going if you are going to jupiter you have a very high radiation you know environment it 's about the same radiation environment close by jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor so just imagine you take your and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work so these are kind of some of the little challenges you know you saw in the video a parachute breaking that would be a bad day you know if that happened so we have to test because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds we are coming at high speeds and we are deploying them to slow us down so we have to do all kinds of tests to give you an idea of the size you know of that parachute relative to the people standing there next step we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them and then we back you know from that point and this next rover that we 're flying is about the size of a car and that will be basically built over the next year and it will be launched june a year from now now in that case because it was a very big we couldn 't use airbags and i know many of you kind of last time afterwards said well that was a cool cool thing to have those airbags unfortunately this rover is like ten times the size of the you know and we didn 't want to so we came up with this ingenious idea which is used here on earth for helicopters actually the lander will come down to about one hundred feet and hover and that rover will be more kind of like a chemist what we are going to be doing with that rover as it drives around it 's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks so it will have but also if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff we have a little laser system but it 's real it 's real stuff you know fun things we are doing on mars i thought i 'd go to the lord of the rings now and show you some of the things we have there now the lord of the rings one it 's a very attractive how the solar system actually formed some of the scientists believe that the way the solar system formed that the sun when it collapsed and actually created the sun a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together and they formed the idea is by watching saturn we 're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale so it 's like a test bed for it so let me show you a little bit on this is not animation or anything like this this is actually taken from the satellite that we have in orbit around saturn the cassini now you think that those rings are very large objects yes they are very large in one dimension in the other dimension they are paper thin and that 's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one so think about it as which is rotating and we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form each one looking very different and very odd and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this and telling nasa we need more money so we can explain what these things look like or why they formed that way and we measured it from orbit made of ice but there was something bizarre what we call tiger stripes when we flew over them all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature back and guess what we saw geysers coming out so this is a yellowstone you know you know below the surface and somehow through some dynamic effect we 're having these geysers which are being you know emitted from it and the we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure we flew at the top of it and over the next few years as we keep orbiting it 's a satellite bigger than our moon except it 's a lot colder and now methane gets people all excited because it 's organic material so immediately people start thinking could life have evolved in that location when you have a lot of organic because it 's so cold frozen three billion years ago before life we dropped a probe as we were and then with an instrument we have on board a radar instrument we found there are lakes like the great lakes in here so it looks very much like earth it looks like there are rivers on it there are oceans or lakes we know there are we think it 's raining also on it so it 's very much like the cycle on earth except because it 's so cold it could not be water you know so if you were on mars sorry on titan you don 't have to worry about drive to the nearest lake stick your hose in it and you 've got your car filled up on the other hand if you light a match the whole planet will blow up this is a picture of saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind saturn looking towards the sun the sun is behind saturn so we see what we call scattering so it highlights all the rings so as you zoom in you know you can see earth you know just in the middle here so we zoomed all the way on the art center"
