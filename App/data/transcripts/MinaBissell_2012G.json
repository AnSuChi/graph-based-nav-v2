  "transcript": "but i love this cartoon from the new yorker well i 'm afraid i used to be the cat i always wanted to be outside the box and it 's partly because i came to this field from a different background chemist and a bacterial geneticist so what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer sources of cancer for that matter why you are who you are didn 't make sense so let me quickly try and tell you why i thought that and how i went about it i have to give you a very very quick lesson in developmental biology with apologies to those of you who know some biology so when your mom and dad met there is a fertilized egg that round thing with that little blip it grows and then it grows and then it makes this handsome man this guy with all the cells in his body so how did his nose it has the genetic information you all remember dolly it came from a single mammary cell so why doesn 't it do it so have a guess of how many cells he has in his body trillion to seventy trillion cells in his body trillion now and so the question i raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell and it would make you well this did not make sense to me do you even know how a trillion looks now let 's look at so i decided over the years because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture and let me quickly tell you some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this rous discovered this in one thousand nine hundred and eleven it was the first he made a filtrate he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter so scientists were very excited and they said a single oncogene can do it all you need is put the cells in cultures chicken cells dumped the virus on it and it would pile up and they would say this is malignant and this is normal and again this didn 't make sense to me and we injected it into the embryos now look at that there is that beautiful feather in the embryo and they 're part of the feather what does that mean means that microenvironment and the context which surrounds those cells actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do the normal example let 's take the human mammary gland i work on breast cancer so there are all these pretty developing tree like structures so we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland which is called an acinus where there are all these little things and we said wonderful look at this pretty structure want to make this a structure and ask the question how do the cells do that so we took the red cells you see the red cells are surrounded by blue and it was just having a structure to keep it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk because it just came from an and within three days they look like that they completely forget for example here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk on the left there is nothing on the right look at the nuclei the nuclei in the they are completely different from each other so einstein said that for an idea that does not first seem insane there is no hope so you can imagine the amount of skepticism i received couldn 't get money and all those lovely acini are and i said that red stuff maybe it tells the cells what to do maybe it tells the signals and actually tells the cells what to do extracellular matrix in it we put the cells in it and lo and behold in about four days they got reorganized and on the right is what we can make in culture on the left is what 's inside the animal we call it in vivo and the one in culture was full of milk the lovely red there is full of milk so we got milk for the american audience all right context goes i said if it 's true that architecture is dominant architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it 's normal could this be done so we tried it we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant and on the left is the single normal cell human breast put on the right you see it looks very ugly the cells continue to grow the normal ones and you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor it was wonderful boggles my mind this is what we got we can revert the malignant phenotype and in order to show you that the malignant phenotype i but you see that on the left are the malignant cells all of them are malignant we add one single inhibitor we inject the other ones in the we should be able to be dealing with these things at this level and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and function and here is another five seconds of repose is my mantra and of course we now ask where do we go now we 'd like to take this kind of thinking but before we do that i 'd like you to think that at any given time when you 're sitting there in your seventy trillion cells the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix we have i have to tell you that there are so many additional discoveries to be made there is so much mystery we don 't and i always say to the students and post docs i lecture to don 't be arrogant because arrogance kills curiosity curiosity and passion so we have now made an amazing discovery post doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me what do the cells do when you put them in what do they do in the beginning when they they do i said i don 't know we couldn 't look at them we didn 't so she being an imager and a physicist did this incredible thing this is a single human breast cell so i 'd like to i used to love english literature and i debated in college which one should i do and o brightening glance how [ can the minute he stops we have neither i have been fortunate to have had these magnificant and i have had many of these groups come and go they are the future and i try to make them and i 'd like to leave you with this thought on the left is water coming through the shore taken from a nasa satellite if you take the mammary gland and spread it and take the fat away on a dish why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again and i 'd like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome we know everything about the sequence of the gene the language of the gene the alphabet of the gene about the language and alphabet of form so it 's a wonderful new horizon it 's a wonderful thing to discover for the young and the passionate old and that 's me"
