  "transcript": "and usually when i tell people i 'm an artist they just look at me and say do you paint or what kind of medium do you work in well most of my work that i work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific and i had a little bit of a problem a few years ago so let me show you a little of that so it started over here and this is the detroit airport in june 19th of two thousand and two i was flying back to the u s from an exhibition overseas and as i was coming back well i was taken by the fbi met by an fbi agent and and then literally just out of nowhere the guy asks me where were you september 12th and when most of us get asked where were you september 12th or any date for that fact it 's like i don 't exactly and i don 't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records good thing i did because i don 't look good in orange so he asked me so this storage unit that you paid the rent on what did you have in it this was in tampa florida so i was like winter clothes that i have no use for in florida pretty certain there were no explosives and if there were i would have remembered that one and he 's still a little confused but i think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes i 'm not exactly a terrorist threat and so we 're sitting there and eventually after about an i 'm going to pass this onto the tampa office they 're the ones who initiated this they 'll follow up with you and we 'll take care of it i was like great so i got home and the phone rings and a man introduced himself basically this is the fbi offices in tampa where i spent six months of my life back and forth not six months continuously by the way you folks know that in the united states you can 't take but google can do it for you so to the folks from google thank you so questions like have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the united states or a foreign nation and you also have to consider the state of mind you 're in when you 're doing this someone that essentially decides life or death or questions such as actually during the polygraph which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them one of the polygraph questions was well the first one was is your name hasan yes are we in florida yes is today tuesday yes because you have to base it on a yes or no then of course the next question is do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states i work at a university so i was like maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly but they said okay aside from what we had discussed do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs they said hey everything 's fine i was like i and i was like all we need is alaska not to get the last memo and here we go all over again and there was a sincere concern there and he was like you know if you get into trouble give us a call we 'll take care of it so ever since then before i would go anywhere i would call the fbi i would northwest flight seven coming into seattle on march or whatever a let them know it wasn 't that i had to but i chose to just wanted to say hey guys don 't want to make it look like i 'm making any sudden moves i don 't want you guys to think that i 'm about to flee just letting you know heads up and so i just kept doing this over and over and over and then the phone calls turned into emails and the emails got longer and longer and longer with pictures with travel tips then i 'd make websites and then i built this over here let me go back to it over here so i actually designed this back in two thousand and three so this kind of tracks me at any given moment i wrote some code for my mobile phone basically what i decided is and i 'll help you out so in the process start thinking well what else might they know about me well they probably have all my flight records so i decided to put all my flight records from birth so you can see delta one thousand two hundred and fifty two going from and then you see these are some of the meals that i 've been fed on the planes nineteen going from jfk to san francisco see that they won 't let me on a plane with that but they 'll give it to me on the plane these are the airports that i hang out in because i like and when you 're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence you 're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner at the time that this was going on the last thing on my mind was art project i was certainly not thinking hey i got new this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this and it actually became this project so these are the stores that i shop in this is me buying some duck flavored paste at the ranch ninety nine in daly city on sunday november 15th and i bought some crabs too and some chitlins at the safeway in emoryville and laundry too laundry detergent at west oakland east oakland sorry and then my pickled jellyfish at the hong kong supermarket on route eighteen in east brunswick now if you go to my bank records it 'll actually show something from there so you know that on may 9th that i bought $ fourteen so there 's points and these points are actually being cross referenced and there 's a verification taking place sometimes they 're really small purchases so thirty four cents foreign transaction fee all of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts and everything pops up right away this is sometimes you just get this just an empty hallway in salt lake city january 22nd and i can tell you exactly who i was with where i was because this is what i had to do with the fbi i had to tell them every little detail of everything i spend a lot of time on the road this is a parking lot in elko nevada and then sometimes you don 't get much information at all you just get this empty bed so again you have to do some sometimes the databases get so specific these are all tacos eaten in mexico city near a train station on july fifth to july sixth at eleven thirty nine a m was this one at one fifty six p m was this one at four fifty nine p m was this one so i time stamp my life every few moments every few moments and it all goes straight up to my server and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together because they want to know about my business so on december 4th i went here so what you 're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces all this information if you go to my site there 's tons of things and really it 's not the most user friendly interface it 's actually quite user unfriendly what i 'm basically telling you is i 'm telling you everything but in this barrage of noise that i 'm putting out i actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life so what do you do when everything is out there well you have to take control over it it 's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces the other thing that 's also interesting that 's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies and it doesn 't matter who they are they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information or restricted access to information the reason their information has any value is well because no one else has access to it and by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up wouldn 't work if everybody was sharing everything and we 're getting to that when i first started this project people were looking at me and saying why would you want to tell everybody what you 're doing where you 're at why are you posting these photos this was an age before people were tweeting everywhere and seven hundred and fifty million people i 'm still doing this project but it is obsolete because you 're all doing it this is something that we all are doing on a daily basis whether we 're aware of it or not so we 're creating our own archives and so on why are you doing this because no one 's really watching no one 's really going to bother you so one of the things that i do is i actually look my server logs very carefully because it 's about surveillance i 'm watching who 's watching me and so you can see that the homeland security likes to come by you can see the national security agency likes to come by i actually moved very close to them i live right down the street from them now executive office of the president not really sure why they show up but they do i think so thank you very much it 's no different than it 's one of those things we got by just fine before we had to do any of those so it 's just become another day i mean when we update a status message we don 't really think about how long that 's going to take so it 's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks send and then it 's done and everything 's automated at the other end bg on the day so it holds onto the very last point flight you 'll see the last airport that i departed from"
