  "transcript": "i 've been thinking a lot about the world recently and how it 's changed over the last twenty thirty forty years twenty or thirty years ago if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died in a remote village in east asia it would have been a tragedy for the chicken and its closest relatives but i don 't think there was much possibility of us fearing if a bank in north america lent too much money to some people who couldn 't afford to pay it back and the bank went bust that was bad for the lender and bad for the borrower but we didn 't imagine it would bring the global economic system to its knees for nearly a decade this is the miracle that has enabled us to transship our bodies and our minds and our words and our pictures and our ideas and our teaching and our learning around the planet ever faster and ever cheaper it 's brought a lot of bad stuff like the stuff that i just described but it 's also brought a lot of good stuff a lot of us are not aware of the extraordinary successes several of which have achieved their targets long before the due date that proves but if i had to put it in a nutshell these days i sort of feel that globalization has taken us by surprise and we 've been slow to respond if you look at the downside of globalization it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming all of the grand challenges that we face today like climate change and human rights and demographics and terrorism and pandemics and narco trafficking and human slavery and species loss i could go not making an awful lot of progress against an awful lot of those challenges so in a nutshell that 's the challenge that we all face today at this interesting point in history that 's clearly what we 've got to do next we 've somehow got to get our act together and we 've got to figure out how to globalize the solutions better so that we don 't simply become a species which is the victim of the globalization why are we so slow at achieving these advances what 's the reason for it there are of course a number of reasons but perhaps the primary reason is because we 're still organized as a species in the same way that we were organized two hundred or three hundred years ago there 's one superpower left on the planet and that is the seven billion people the seven billion of us who cause all these problems the same seven billion by the way who will resolve them all but how are those seven billion organized they 're still organized in two hundred or so and the nations have governments that make rules but the problem is that the way that those laws are made and the way those governments think is absolutely wrong for the solution of global problems because it all looks they look in they behave as if they believed that every country was an island that existed quite happily independently of all the others on its own little planet in its own little solar system this is the problem but even we clearly need to find ways of encouraging countries to start working together a little bit better and why won 't they do that when we elect governments or when we tolerate unelected governments we 're effectively telling them that what we want is for them to deliver us in our country a certain number of things justice and all of those things so unless we start asking our governments to think outside a little bit to consider the global problems that will finish us all if we don 't start considering them if they still have minds that microscope rather than minds that telescope that 's the first reason why things tend not to change the second reason is that lacks the ability to really empathize with other human beings they don 't see other human beings with deep rich three dimensional personal lives and aims and ambitions what they see is but actually aren 't most of us not really so very good at empathy oh sure we 're very good at empathy when it 's a question of dealing with people who kind of look like us and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray but when it comes to people who don 't do that who don 't quite dress like us and don 't quite pray like us and don 't quite talk like us the third reason is this is just nonsense in my day job i 'm a policy adviser i 've spent the last fifteen years or so advising governments around the world and in all of that time i have never once seen a single domestic policy issue that could not be more imaginatively effectively and rapidly resolved bringing in others working externally given all of that why then doesn 't it work why can we not make our politicians change why can 't we demand them i think we should just accept that we are an inherently conservative species we don 't like to change we probably wouldn 't still be here today if we weren 't so resistant to change it 's very simple many thousands of years ago we discovered and it 's very sensible not to do anything new because it might kill you and one of the exceptions the interesting exception is when you can show to people that there might be some making that leap of faith and changing a little bit so i 've spent a lot of the last ten or fifteen years trying to find out what could be that self interest that would encourage not just politicians but also businesses and general populations all of us to start to think a little more outwardly to think in a bigger picture not always to look and this is where i discovered something quite important two thousand and five i launched a study called the nation brands index what it is it 's a very large scale study that polls a very large sample of the world 's population a sample that represents about seventy percent and i started asking them a series of questions about how they perceive other countries and the nation brands index over the years has grown to be a very very large database it 's about two hundred billion data points tracking what ordinary people think about other countries and why why did i do this well because the governments that i advise are very very keen on knowing how they are regarded partly because i 've encouraged them to realize it that countries depend enormously on their reputations in order to survive and prosper in the world if a country has a great positive image like germany has or sweden or switzerland everything is easy and everything is cheap you get more tourists you get more investors you sell your products more expensively everything is difficult and everything is expensive so governments care desperately about the image of their country because it makes a direct difference to how much money they can make and that 's what they 've promised their populations they 're going to deliver why do some people prefer one country more than another and the answer that the database gave me completely staggered me it was six point eight i haven basically what it told me was the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries because they 're modern because they 're technologically what do we mean by good we mean countries that seem to contribute something to the world in which we live countries that actually make the world safer or better or richer or fairer if you want to sell more products if you want to get more if you want to become more competitive then you need to start behaving because that 's why people will respect you and do business with you i swear that as i get older my ideas become simpler and more and more childish this one is called the good nobody had ever thought of measuring this before so my colleague dr robert govers and i have spent the best part of the last two years with the help of a large number of very serious and clever people cramming together all the reliable data in the world we could find about what countries but first of all i want to tell you precisely what i mean gooder and this is a country which simply gives more to humanity than i don 't talk about how they behave at home because that 's measured elsewhere and the winner is ireland no country on per dollar of gdp contributes more to the world that we live in than ireland what does this mean this means that as we go to sleep at night all of us in the last fifteen seconds before we drift off to sleep our final thought should be godammit i 'm glad that ireland exists that 's really something finland ranks pretty much the same the only reason why it 's below ireland is because its lowest score is lower than ireland 's lowest score this depressed me because one of the things that i did not want to discover with this index is that it 's purely the province of rich countries to help poor countries this is not what it 's all about and that demonstrates one very very important thing this is not about money this is i 'm going to whip through the other slides just so you can see some of the lower lying countries there 's germany at 13th the u s comes and then we have some of the big developing countries like russia at 95th china at 107th but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth it 's there really because i want to try to into the discourse i 've even had enough hearing about happy countries i think we all know what it is that we want to hear about we want to hear about good countries i 'm not asking a lot it 's something that you might find easy to do and you might even find enjoyable and even helpful to do when you talk about the world that we live in today start using that word in the the opposite of selfish good being a country that thinks about all of us that 's what i would like you to do and i 'd like you to use it as a stick with which to beat your politicians when you reelect them when you vote for them when you listen to what they 're offering you that word good and ask yourself is that what a good country would do and if the answer is no be very suspicious ask yourself is that the behavior of my country do i want to come from a country where the government in my name is doing things like that or do i on the other hand prefer the i 'm proud to come from a good country and everybody will welcome you i 'm glad that person 's country exists ultimately that i think is what will make the change that word good and the number six point eight and the discovery that 's behind it have and i think we can use it to change the way that our politicians and our companies behave and in doing so we can change the world i 've started thinking very differently about my own country since i 've been thinking about these things i thank you"
