  "transcript": "i 've got something to show you think about this as a pixel a flying pixel now if you take this picture i 'm italian originally and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom but the reason i 'm showing you this is that and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car now today if you want to win the race actually you need also something like this something that monitors the car in real time has a few and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected you would call a real time control system and basically it 's a system made of two components a sensing and an actuating component what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives our cities over the past few years just have been blanketed with electronics they 're becoming like computers in open air and as computers in open air they 're starting to respond in a different to be able to be sensed and to be actuated but they are fifty percent of the world 's population they are seventy five percent of the energy consumption beyond cities all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects that 's from an exhibition that paola antonelli is organizing at moma later this year during the summer it 's called talk to me well our objects our environment is starting and that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment it 's almost as if the old dream of michelangelo you know when michelangelo sculpted the moses at the end it said that he took the hammer threw it at the moses actually you can still see a small chip underneath why don 't you talk well today for the first time our environment is starting to talk back to us show just a few examples again with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it it was four and a half years ago in italy and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world that 's a cellphone network and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network that 's collected anyway by the operator in order to understand how the city works it 's when italy won the soccer world cup some of you might remember it was italy and france playing and then zidane at the end the headbutt and anyway italy won at the end now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network here you see the city the river you see the timeline on the top early afternoon people here and there making calls and moving the match begins silence france second zidane the headbutt in a moment italy wins yeah applause well that night everybody went to celebrate in in the center you saw the big peak the following everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time and then everybody moved down you see the image of the place called circo massimo where since roman times people go to celebrate it 's not about people but about things we use and consume well today know everything about where our objects come from this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a so we actually started with just over a year ago to tag what they were throwing away different types of things as you can see here things they would throw away anyway then we put a little chip little tag onto the trash and then started following it here are the results we just obtained we can actually do the same thing with much less energy this data was not available before but there 's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we 're throwing away it doesn 't disappear it 's still somewhere on the my colleague at mit and that 's actuating our environment and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza in architecture and the question was how could technology new technology be added to that and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a workshop was imagine this pipe and you 've got create like a water curtain with pixels made of water if those pixels fall you can you can show patterns images text and even you can approach it and it will open up to let you jump through as you see in this image well we presented this to mayor belloch he liked it very much and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo we called it digital water pavilion the whole building is made of water there 's no doors or windows but when you approach it it will open up to let you in and if there 's a bit of wind if you want to minimize splashing you can actually lower the roof or you could and the whole architecture will disappear like in this case you know these days you always get images during the winter when they take the roof down of people who have been there it just when it goes down the architecture almost here 's the building working you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside and i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working but actually more fun all the kids from zaragoza came to the building because the way of engaging with the building became something different not anymore a building that would open up to let you in but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water and you had to jump without getting but then reality 's always unpredictable and that 's the beauty of and then projections on them and this is what led us to think about the following project i 'll show you now and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights almost here is the video so imagine one helicopter so you can have this cloud you can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this a regular configuration in two dimensions or in where the thing that changes is the light not the pixels ' position you can play with type imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes but then the the whole thing can be here is the real flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before when you turn on the light actually you see this so the same as we saw before and imagine each of them then controlled top ballet dancers the toile at metropolitan in new york and la scala in milan and actually captured his movement in 3d and here you can see you see on the left the pixels the different resolutions being captured it 's both 3d scanning in real time and motion capture so you can reconstruct a whole movement you can go all the way through but then once we have the pixels then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and so we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for flyfire it 's called the cloud we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment almost to impart what we call cloud raising like and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that over we went from the physical world to the digital one this has been digitizing everything knowledge and making that accessible through the internet now today for the first time and the obama campaign showed us this we can go from the digital world from the self organizing power of networks to the physical one but tomorrow it can be in order to tackle today 's pressing challenges think about climate change or co2 emissions how we can go from the the cloud is a cloud again made of pixels in the same way as you can move inside have different types of experiences you can actually see from underneath sharing the main moments for the olympics in two thousand and twelve and beyond and so both the physical cloud in the sky and you can enter inside it and a kind of new digital beacon for the night but most importantly a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top"
