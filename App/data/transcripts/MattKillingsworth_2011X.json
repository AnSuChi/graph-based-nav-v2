  "transcript": "aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim according to this view the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn 't that these things are intrinsically valuable it 's that we expect them to bring us we live longer we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we haven 't actually gotten any happier there 's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved well as with many other domains in life i think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question in fact in the last few years there 's been an explosion in research on happiness for example we 've learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it but one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don 't seem to have a particularly strong effect but the differences in happiness tend to be small i think that 's a question we haven 't really answered yet but i think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents who we 're with what we 're thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study a few years ago i came up with a way to study people 's happiness moment to moment as they 're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world something we 'd never been able to do before called it uses the iphone to monitor people 's happiness in real time and then i ask them a bunch of questions about their moment to moment experience at the instant just before the signal minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they 're we 've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data a lot more data of this kind than i think has ever been collected before over six hundred and fifty thousand real time reports from over fifteen thousand people and it 's not just a lot of people it 's a really diverse group people from a wide range of ages from eighteen to late 80s a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc they collectively represent every one of eighty six occupational categories and hail from over eighty countries what i 'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we 've been investigating and that and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month maybe he 's worried that he 's going bald you 've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now you 've probably heard a hundred times maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment maybe these people are right maybe mind wandering is a bad thing on the other hand when our minds wander they 're unconstrained maybe when our minds wander they 're going to someplace happier than the place that they 're leaving it would make a lot of sense maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering well since i 'm a scientist i 'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data and in particular i 'd like to present some data to you from three questions that i ask with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment to moment experience in people 's real lives how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good second an activity question what are you doing on a list of twenty two different activities including things like eating and working and watching tv people could say no in other words i 'm focused only on my task or yes i am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering so what did we find this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they 're focused on the present when they 're not mind wandering as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they 're not sure on average people are less happy when they 're mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn 't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us people don 't really like commuting to work very much it 's one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when they 're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else how could this be happening we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormously less happy when they do that and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral they 're still considerably less happy than when they 're not at all even when they 're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant they 're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren 't mind wandering right you 'd never want to play so i 've been talking about this suggesting perhaps but all i 've really shown you is that these two things are correlated but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind wander maybe that 's what 's really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilites well we 're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does mind wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind wandering to get some insight into the causal direction consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy in contrast there 's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later in other words very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness well how often do people 's minds wander turns out they wander a lot in fact really a lot forty seven percent of the time this shows the rate of mind wandering across twenty two activities ranging from a high of when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to fifty percent when they 're working to forty percent when they 're exercising all the way down to this one short bar on the right that i think some of you are probably laughing at ten percent of the time people 's minds are wandering when they 're having sex and that is basically with one exception no matter what people are doing they 're mind wandering at least thirty percent of the time it pervades basically everything that"
