  "transcript": "and the phone rang you have to make a wish to save the world nobody can up come on you have dictators the north pole is melting and as the last ted prize winner said we 're all becoming fat except maybe french people whatever but to change the the world i was doing graffiti on the rooftops with my friends each trip was an excursion was an adventure i started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies really small photos just that size at seventeen years old i started pasting them and i did my first expo de rue which means sidewalk gallery and i framed it the city 's the best gallery i could imagine i would never have to make a book then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people i would control it directly with the public i would change the places i would go the title of the of the exhibition that 's on the champs elysees i was quite proud of that one because i was just eighteen and i was just up there on the top of the champs elysees then when the photo left still there november two thousand and five the streets are burning a large wave of riots everyone was glued to the tv watching disturbing frightening images i mean these kids without control throwing molotov cocktails and then i saw it could it be possible my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car a pasting i 'd done a year earlier these were the faces of my friends i know those guys all of them are not angels but they 're not monsters either so i went back there they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves and then i pasted age even building number of these guys the exhibition was displayed in front of the so could art change the world i was listening to all the noise so with my friend marco we decided to go there are they so different we just went in the street started talking with people so we decided to take portraits cooks asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment not a smile that really doesn 't tell about who you are and what you feel they all accepted to be pasted i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever we called the project face two face the experts said no way the people will not accept the army will shoot you and hamas will kidnap you we said okay let 's try and push as far as we can i love the way that people will ask me how big will my photo be it will be as big as your house and so palestinians i 'm going to find you a solution so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born we did face two face with only six friends two ladders two brushes we had all sorts of help from all walks of life okay for example that 's palestine we 're in ramallah right now we 're pasting portraits so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market people come around us and start asking what are you doing here oh we 're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an israeli and a palestinian doing the same job and those and then there was always a silence you mean you 're pasting an israeli face doing a face right here well yeah yeah that 's part of the project and i would always leave that moment and we would ask them so can you tell me who is who and most of them couldn 't say military towers and nothing happened people can tear it tag on it or even pee on it some are a bit high for that i agree but the people in the street most of them are still there face two face demonstrated that what we thought impossible we didn 't push the limit we just showed that they were further than anyone thought in the middle east i experienced my work in places so the reactions in the street so i decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums but the men are still the ones holding the streets so we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents i couldn 't always understand the complicated circumstances i just i just took their pictures and pasted them most of the places i went to i decided to go there because i 've heard about it and then i heard about this terrible thing that happened in rio de the first favela of brazil named providencia three kids that was three students were [ detained ] by the army and the army took them and instead of bringing them to the police station i heard it was one of the most violent favelas because the largest drug cartel controls it so i decided to go there and we met a woman and i showed her my book i just took a few photos of the kids and the next day i came with the posters and we pasted them the day after i came back and they were already scratched then the next i held a meeting on the main square and some women came they were all linked to the three kids that got killed there was the mother the grandmother the best friend they all wanted to shout the story everyone in the favela gave me the green light i took more photos and we started the project the drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place so what i want to show is the incredible life and energy i 've been seeing it around me the last few days that 's where the traffickers always stand and everyone there understood the project and then we pasted everywhere the whole hill what was interesting is that the media couldn 't get i mean you should see that they would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and we would see ourselves on tv pasting and they would put a number please call this number if you know what 's going on in providencia we just did a project and then left so the media wouldn 't know so how can we know about the project so they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from so you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women kenya i mean they want to know what you 're up to they kept asking me what is the purpose of your project are you an ngo are you the media art just why is it in black and white don 't you have color in france or they tell you are these people all dead some who understood the project would explain it to others and to a man who did not understand i heard someone say you know you 've been here for a few hours trying to understand discussing with your fellows you haven 't thought about i think it 's people 's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects and then it becomes more it becomes a desire a need an armor on this bridge that 's in ex rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war women are always the first you might have seen images about the post election violence that happened there in two thousand and eight because paper doesn 't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house vinyl so the people kept it you know what i love is for example when you see the biggest eye there there are so [ many ] houses inside and i went there a few months ago photos are still there and it was missing a piece of the eye so i asked the people what happened india but there are places where you on a wall in india it was just impossible to paste i heard so people would come to us and ask us but you know how india has a lot of dust in the streets and the more dust you would have going up in the air on the white paper you can almost see but so the more dust you have the more it will reveal the photo so we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves so we each project that 's a film from women are heroes most of what you see that 's a trailer from women are heroes kept traveling even without us wind because that 's a big part of it there 's layers behind each photo behind each image is a story women are heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities and the women kept that dynamic after we left but to get it they would have to [ get ] it signed by one of the women and so in in providencia for example in the favela we have a cultural center running there in kibera each year we cover more roofs because of course when we left the what about my roof so we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project a so i have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects that is for me one of the more important things in the work i think today as important as the result is the way you do things and that has always been a central part of the work and what 's interesting is that that fine line that i have with images and advertising we just did some pasting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks and but yesterday the city called them and said look you 're going to have to tear it down because this can be taken for advertising and because of the law it has to be taken down but tell me advertising for what the people i photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community but they asked me for a promise basically they asked me please make our story travel with you so i did that 's paris new york where the statement it makes where it 's pasted so for example i pasted the photo of the minaret in switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally and i pasted it in southern italy where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground to change practical things but to change perceptions art can create an analogy actually the fact that art cannot change when i do my work i have two kinds why don 't you go in iraq or afghanistan they would be really useful or how can we help and that 's good because so now my wish is to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project and together we 'll turn the world everyone watching i wanted that wish to actually start now a subject you 're passionate about a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos tell me what you stand for take the photos the portraits upload it i 'll give you all the details join by groups and reveal things to the world the full data is on the website thank you"
