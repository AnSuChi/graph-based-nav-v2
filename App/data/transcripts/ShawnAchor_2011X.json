  "transcript": "i was two years older than my sister at the time i mean i 'm two years older than her now but at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do and i wanted to play war so we were up on top of our bunk beds and on the other side were all my sister 's my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story which is my sister 's a little on the clumsy without any help or push from her older brother at all amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which i have yet to be thanked i was trying as hard as i could she didn 't even see it coming i was trying hard to be on my best behavior and i saw my sister 's face this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents from the long winter 's did you see how you landed no human lands on all fours like that amy i think this means amy the hurt five year old little sister but amy the special unicorn of course this option was open to her brain at no point in the past and you could see how my poor manipulated sister faced conflict and the latter won instead of crying or ceasing our play instead of waking my parents with all the negative consequences a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn with one broken leg what we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven we had no idea at the time was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain we had stumbled across something called positive psychology which is the reason i 'm here today and the reason that i wake up every morning when i started talking about this research outside of academia with companies and schools the first thing they said to never do is to start what we which is all that really matters there is one weird red dot above the curve there 's one weirdo in the room i know who you are i saw you earlier that 's no problem that 's no problem as most of you know because i can just delete that dot i can delete that dot because that 's clearly a measurement error and we know that 's a measurement error because it 's messing up my data so one of the first things we teach people in economics statistics business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos how do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit which is fantastic if i 'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be if i 'm interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity we 're creating the cult of the average with science if i asked a question like how fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom because that means you 're depressed have a disorder or hopefully both we 're hoping for both because our business model is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten so you keep coming back we 'll go back into your childhood if necessary but and positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average then instead of deleting those positive outliers what i intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say whatever it is instead of deleting you what i want to do is study you because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide the reason this graph is important to me is on the news the majority of the information is not positive in fact negative most of it 's about murder corruption diseases natural disasters and very quickly my brain starts to think that 's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world the medical school syndrome during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases suddenly you realize you have all of them i bobo married amy unicorn bobo called me on the phone from yale medical school and bobo said shawn i have leprosy but i had no idea how to console poor bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause 're finding it 's not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality and if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time i didn 't expect to get in and my family had no money for college when i got a military scholarship two weeks later they let me go something that wasn 't even a possibility became a reality i assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well that they 'd be excited to be there even in a classroom full of people smarter than you i felt you 'd be happy just to be in that classroom but what i found is while some people experience that when i graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students harvard asked me to i i was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years and in my research nor on their philosophy or physics but on the competition the workload the hassles stresses complaints when i first went in there i walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from waco texas which is where i grew up i know some of you why do you waste your time studying happiness at harvard what does a harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness because what that question assumes if i know everything about your external world i can only predict ten twenty five % of job successes are predicted by iq seventy five percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat i talked to a new england wednesday night is eating disorders thursday night is illicit drug use and friday night we 're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness which i 'm glad you liked but they did not like that at all silence on the phone and into the silence i said we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success then i 'll be happier that undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles the way that we motivate our behavior and the problem is it 's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons every time your brain has a success you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like you got good grades now you have to get better grades you got into a good school and after you get into a better one you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target we and that 's because we think we have to be successful which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative neutral or stressed your intelligence rises your creativity rises your energy levels rise in fact we 've found that every single business outcome improves then our brains work even more successfully faster and more intelligently we need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of because dopamine which floods into your system when it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way we 've found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work and at the end of that their brain we find that meditation allows your brain to get random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies what we 've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness"
