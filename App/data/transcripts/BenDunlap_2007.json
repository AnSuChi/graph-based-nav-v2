  "transcript": "language spoken by hungarians for which given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago but pack i said somebody here must surely know because despite the fact that there aren 't that many hungarians to begin with and the further fact that so far as i know there 's not a drop of hungarian blood in my veins at every critical juncture of my life there has been a hungarian friend or mentor there beside me i even have dreams that take place in landscapes i recognize as the landscapes of hungarian films especially the early movies of miklos jancso so once imagined a future for itself as an independent country and as a consequence of that presumption my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army an experience that has befallen many a hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history or maybe it 's because when i was a teenager back in the ' 50s my uncle henry having denounced the ku klux klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard living under death threat took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety and went back to south carolina to face down the klan alone that was a very hungarian thing to do as anyone will attest who remembers it seems to me that this hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for but ultimately but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians so j napot pack i went back to south carolina after some fifteen years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the the reckless condescension of that era thinking i would save my people never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate south carolina a 90 year old hungarian surrounded by a bevy of middle aged european women who seemed to function as an entourage of rhinemaidens his name was sandor teszler he was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead minus the loincloth plus orthopedic boots he had been born in one thousand nine hundred and three in the provinces of the old austro hungarian empire in what later would become yugoslavia he was ostracized as a child not because he was a jew his parents weren 't very religious anyhow but because he had been born with two club feet a condition which in those days required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and eleven he went to the commercial business high school as a young man in budapest he built one plant after another he married he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants the night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks it was a hosiery mill and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was shoveling in mountains of socks mr teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said but why do you steal from me if you need money you have only to ask the night watchman seeing how things were going and waxing indignant said well we 're going to call the police aren 't we he will not steal from us again well maybe he was too because he stayed where he was long after the nazi anschluss in austria and even after the arrests and deportations began in budapest in those early days of the final it was handcrafted but none who entered that death house had ever come out alive and in a twist you would not believe in a steven spielberg film it was a brutal beating midway through looked up and said is it time to take the capsule now papa and the gauleiter who afterwards vanishes from this story leaned down and whispered into mr teszler 's ear no do not take the capsule help is on the way and then resumed the beating but help help was on the way and shortly afterwards a car arrived from the swiss embassy they were spirited to safety they were reclassified as yugoslav probably mr teszler had gotten some money into swiss bank accounts because he managed to take his family first to great britain then to long island and then to the center of the textile industry in the american south which as chance would have it was spartanburg south carolina the location of wofford college and there mr teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double knit and then then in the late 1950s in the aftermath of brown v board of education when the klan was resurgent all over the south i have heard this talk before and he called his top assistant to him i reckon that would be kings mountain good buy us some land in kings mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there the man did as he was told and shortly afterwards teszler received a visit from the white mayor of kings mountain now you should know that at that time the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated i trust youre going to be hiring a lot of white workers mr teszler told him you bring me the best workers that you can and if they are good enough i will hire them he also received a visit from the leader of the black community a minister who said mr teszler i sure hope you 're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours he got the same answer i will hire them be his seed group his future foremen he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain and for two months these sixteen men would live and work together mastering the new process and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said 's only one place to eat there 's only one bathroom there 's only one water fountain is this plant going to be integrated or what mr teszler said you are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region and this is how we do business do you have any other questions no i reckon i don 't and two months later when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers white and they toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions and inevitably the same question arose is this plant integrated or what and one of the white foremen stepped forward and said you are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business do you have any other questions and there were none conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint having retired from the textile industry adopted wofford college auditing courses every semester becoming affectionately known by all and sundry before i got there the library of the college had been named for mr teszler and after i arrived in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three the faculty decided to honor itself by naming mr teszler professor of the college partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses in the catalog but mainly because he was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us to me it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina was a holocaust survivor from central europe i was screening the opening segment of ingmar bergman 's the seventh seal as the medieval knight antonius block returns from the wild goose chase of the crusades and arrives on the rocky shore of sweden only to find the specter of death waiting for him teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students and as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight in a ghastly embrace i heard mr teszler 's tremulous voice uh oh he said this doesn 't look so good especially opera and on the first occasion that i visited his house he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to and i delighted him by rejecting cavalleria rusticana in favor of bela bartok 's bluebeard 's castle i love bartok 's music as did mr teszler and he had virtually every recording of bartok 's music and it was at his house that i heard for the first time bartok 's third piano concerto and learned from mr teszler that it had been composed in nearby asheville north carolina in the last year of the composer 's life he was dying of leukemia and he knew it marked adagio religioso he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part and clearly clearly this composition is his final statement to her it was first performed after his death it was all so beautiful whenever you hear this i will be there it was only after teszler 's death that i learned that the marker on the grave of bela bartok in hartsdale new york was paid for by sandor teszler ninety seven he heard me hold forth on human mr teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said you know doctor human beings are fundamentally good and i made a vow to myself then and there that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion i would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow and now he 's dead so i 'm stuck with my vow j napot sandor i thought my skein of hungarian mentors had come to an end but almost immediately i met francis robicsek a hungarian doctor actually a heart surgeon in charlotte north carolina then in his late seventies who had been a pioneer in tinkering away in his garage behind his house had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures beginning as an intern in budapest by collecting dutch art and hungarian painting and when he came to this country moving on to spanish colonial art russian icons and finally mayan he 's the author of seven books six of them on mayan ceramics it was he who broke the mayan codex enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the mayan script and then we paused in front of a closed with shelves from floor to ceiling and crammed on every shelf his collection of mayan ceramics now i know absolutely nothing about mayan ceramics but i wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so i said but it was not a good one it occurred to me that i should invite dr robicsek to lecture at wofford college on what else i should invite him to meet my oldest trustee who had majored in french history at yale some largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand his name is roger milliken and afterwards we convened at the president 's house with dr robicsek on one hand mr milliken on the other and it was only at that moment as we were sitting down to dinner that i recognized the enormity of the risk i had created because to bring these two titans these two masters of the universe together it was like introducing mothra to godzilla over the skyline of tokyo if they didn 't like each other we could all get trampled to death but they did they did like each other and then they got into a furious argument and what they were arguing about was this whether the second harry potter movie was as good as the first mr milliken said it was not dr robicsek disagreed i was still trying to take in the notion that these titans these masters of the universe in their spare time watch harry potter movies when mr milliken thought he would win the argument by saying you just think it 's so good because you didn 't read the but i 'll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild well yes i did conceded mr milliken aha said dr robicsek i went to the movie all by myself each in his own right and it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity no matter what the subject no matter what the cost even at a time when the keepers of the doomsday clock are willing to bet even money ninety three years from each day as if it is your last said mahatma gandhi learn as if you 'll live forever this is what i 'm passionate about it is precisely this it is this no matter how seditious it might seem this defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians robicsek teszler and bartok as it does"
