  "transcript": "northwest border of modern day slovenia thousand years later a mammoth died in southern germany but these different creatures dispersed across both time and space a bone from each of their skeletons was crafted by human hands into a flute think about that for a second imagine you 've built simple tools for hunting you 've learned how to craft garments from animal skins to keep yourself warm in the winter what would you choose to invent next it seems preposterous that you would invent the flute a tool that created useless vibrations in air molecules but that is exactly what our ancestors did now this sometimes but just as often new ideas come into the world simply because they 're fun and here 's the really strange thing many of those playful but seemingly frivolous inventions ended up sparking momentous transformations in science in politics and society take what may be the most important invention of modern times the standard story is that computers descend from military technology since many of the early computers were designed specifically to crack wartime codes or the origins of the modern computer are much more playful even musical than you might imagine the idea behind the flute of just pushing air through tubes to make a sound someone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds by pressing small levers with our the very first typewriter was originally called the writing harpsichord flutes and music led to even more powerful breakthroughs about a thousand three brothers in baghdad designed a device that was an automated organ they called it the instrument that plays itself now the organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions encoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder and if you wanted the machine to play a different song you just swapped a new cylinder in with a different code on it this instrument was the first of its kind it was programmable now conceptually this was a massive leap forward the whole idea of hardware and software becomes thinkable for the first time with this invention powerful concept didn 't come to us as an instrument of war or of conquest or necessity at all it came from the strange delight of watching a machine play music the idea of programmable machines was exclusively kept alive by music for about seven hundred years machines became the playthings of the used the same coded cylinders to control the physical movements of what were called automata an early kind of robot one of the most famous of those robots was you guessed it an automated flute player designed by a brilliant french inventor named jacques de vaucanson and as de vaucanson was designing his robot musician he had another idea you just programmed a new cylinder this was the first programmable loom another french inventor named jacquard hit upon the brilliant idea paper turned out to be much cheaper and more flexible as a way of programming the device that punch card system inspired victorian inventor charles babbage to create his analytical engine the first true programmable computer ever designed and punch cards were used by computer programmers as late as the 1970s so ask yourself this question but inventing a computer also required other harpsichord keyboards colorful patterns woven into fabric and there 's a long list of world changing ideas and technologies that came out of play the playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory new possibilities in the world around us and that seeking but thinking about play and delight this way also helps us detect what 's coming next think about it if you were sitting there in one thousand seven hundred and fifty trying to figure out the big changes coming to society in the 19th the 20th centuries automated machines computers artificial intelligence a programmable flute entertaining the parisian elite would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time it seemed like an amusement at best not useful in any serious way but it turned out to be the beginning of a tech revolution that would change the world"
