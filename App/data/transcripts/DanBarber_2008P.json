  "transcript": "i went to spain a few months ago and i had i 'm convinced there 's not a food today that 's more maligned it was outlawed in chicago for a while it 's pending here in california and just recently you risk being attacked really it happened here in san francisco to a famous chef i 'm not saying that there 's not a rationale the reasons usually just boil down to the gavage which is the force feeding basically you take a goose or a duck and you you force feed a ton of grain down its throat more grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime liver the problem for us chefs is that it 's so freakin ' delicious i love the stuff it is it makes everything else you put it with taste incredible can we produce a menu yes sure you can also bike the tour de france without steroids right not a lot of people are doing it and for good reason a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy eduardo sousa eduardo is doing what he calls natural to take advantage of when when the temperature drops in the fall geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the for the harsh realities of winter and the rest of the year they 're free to free to roam around eduardo 's and it 's shockingly not a new idea his they 've been doing it quietly ever since that is until last year he placed first for his foie gras problem as he said to me that really pissed the french off he it was all over the papers i read about it it was in le monde spanish chef accused and the french accused him spanish chef accused they implicated actually the spanish government amazingly huh couldn 't find a shred of evidence so that died down and very soon afterward new controversy it 's not foie gras because it 's not gavage he 's lying and should be disqualified articulating it now and reading about it actually if we had talked about it before this controversy i would have said that 's kind of true you know foie gras by definition force feeding it 's gavage and that 's what you get when you when you want foie gras that is until i went to right on the portugal border i saw first hand a system that is incredibly complex and then at the same time like everything beautiful in nature is utterly simple and he said to me my life 's work he repeated that about fifty times in the two days i was with him i 'm just here to give the geese what they want actually when i showed up he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone he 's really just in love with he 's at one with he he 's the goose and when i was speaking to him but sort of in the middle of my questions my excited questions because the more i got to know him and his system the more exciting this he kept going like this to me so you know i slowed down and finally by the end of the day i was like ed uar do you know like this but he was still going like this i kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper and he stopped doing this and amazingly the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when i was around get the hell away from this kid when i lowered my voice they all came right up to us right up to us like right up to here right along the fence line and fence line was amazing in itself the fence like this conception of fence that we have it 's totally backward with him the have you you fence in animals you electrify the inside he doesn 't why because he said to me that he felt like the geese and he proved this actually not just a conceit he he proved this the geese felt manipulated even though they were imprisoned in this garden of eden with figs and everything else he felt like they felt manipulated so he got rid of the electricity he got rid of current on the inside so it would protect them against coyotes and what happened they ate and he showed me on a chart how they ate about twenty percent more feed to feed their livers the landscape is incredible i mean his farm is incredible it really is the garden of eden there 's figs and everything else there for the taking extra hard land right extra difficult extra hard but over four generations he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a a tasting menu upgrades the life for these for these geese and they are allowed to take whatever they want another irony the double irony is that on the figs and the olives 's about fifty percent they 're very fair they leave the rest for me and i sell it his biggest obstacle really was the marketplace which demands these days bright yellow foie gras that 's how i 've been trained you want to look and see what what good foie gras is it 's got to be bright yellow yellow it 's the indication that it 's the well because he doesn 't force feed because he doesn 't gavage tons of corn but he found this wild plant called the lupin bush their foie gras turns yellow radioactive yellow bright yellow of the highest quality foie gras yellow i 've ever seen laughter so i 'm listening to all this you know and i 'm like is this guy for real is he making some of this up is he like you know because he seemed to have an answer for everything and it was always nature it was never him and i was like weirded out by by people who who deflect everything away from themselves because really they want you to look at themselves right but he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into working with his landscape and i hear [ clapping ] from a distance so i look over and he grabs my arm and the translator 's and ducks us under a bush as they start to go past us they 're called back and they 're called back and back and back and then they circle around and his geese are calling up now to the wild geese [ clapping ] and the wild geese are calling i look at eduardo who 's near tears looking at this and i say you 're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say come for a visit and he says the dna of a goose is to fly south in the winter right i said that i said isn 't that what they 're put on this earth for to fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm he said no no no their dna they don 't need anything more stop they mate with his domesticated geese and his flock continues imagine imagine a hog farm in like north carolina and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and how did it taste i finally got to taste it before i left he took me to his neighborhood restaurant and and the problem with saying that of course is that and i 'd like to make a i don 't have one really i was drinking this guy 's kool aid so much he could have served me goose feathers and i would have been like this guy 's a genius i 'm really in love with him at this point but this was transformative really i say to you i might not stick to this but i don 't think i 'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with eduardo but its fat had a lot of integrity and i kept i said i swear to god i tasted star anise i was sure of it and i 'm not like some super taster you know but he takes the liver he sticks them in this jar no spices what we went back out for the final tour of the farm and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity he doesn 't need salt and pepper and he doesn 't need spices because he 's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors that his geese love to gorge on i turned to him at the end of the meal and it 's a question i asked several times and he hadn 't kind of answered me directly but i said now look you 're in spain some of the greatest chefs in the world are ferran adria the preeminent chef of the world today not that far from you how come you don 't give him this how come no one 's really heard of you and it may be because of the wine or it may be because of my excitement he answered me directly and he said because chefs don 't deserve my foie gras they create a dish where all the vectors point at us with eduardo i think i really was moved and in the corner of one of these one of my notes when asked what do you think of conventional foie gras what do you think of foie gras that ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent of the world i 'm on the plane and i 'm just tearing so i did some research when i got back gotten sick of the chicken fat they were looking for an alternative and they saw in the fall that there was this natural beautiful sweet delicious fat right off the internet the pharaoh got i swear to god the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it he tasted it and fell in love with it he started demanding it and he didn 't want it just in the fall he wanted it all year round and the jews fearing for their life had to come up with an ingenious idea or at least they invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives and they provided the pharaoh with gavage liver and supposedly anyway i believe that one most of what we eat today all of it our food system that 's it 's an insult to the basic laws of nature whether we 're talking about beef cattle or we 're talking about broccoli or brussels sprouts or catfish which wholesale are going out of business whatever it is it 's a mindset that if human beings disappeared life on earth as we know it would flourish"
