  "transcript": "checked the weather or even ate a meal these many things that enable our daily lives rely either directly or indirectly on satellites entertainment and to communicate there 's agricultural and environmental monitoring but these satellites that we rely on day in and day out have a finite life they might run out of propellant they could malfunction or they may just naturally reach the end of their mission life at this point these satellites effectively become space junk cluttering the orbital environment so now you have no choice but to abandon your car where it is on the highway maybe you were lucky enough to be able to move it out of the way and into a shoulder lane so that it 's out of the way of other traffic now it 's a useless hunk of metal taking up space in a valuable transportation network thousands of smaller pieces of debris becoming new obstacles this is the paradigm of the satellite so the world 's first satellite sputnik i was launched in there were only a total of three launch attempts especially if you consider things like the possibility of 900 plus satellite constellations being launched now we send satellites to different orbits depending on what they 're needed for possibly to image the surface of earth at up to about two thousand kilometers altitude and they 'll eventually burn up probably within a couple of decades another common place we send satellites is the geostationary orbit at about thirty five thousand kilometers altitude satellites there remain in same place above earth as the earth rotates which enables things like communications or television broadcast for example and then there 's the orbit coined the graveyard the ominous junk or disposal orbits where some satellites are intentionally placed at the end of their life so that they 're out of the way of common operational orbits launched since the late and in addition to the satellites that are no longer working there 's also hundreds of thousands of marble sized debris and millions of paint chip sized debris that are also orbiting around the earth space debris is a major risk to space also to the satellites that we rely on each and every day now because space debris and junk has become increasingly worrisome there have been some national and international efforts to develop technical standards to help us limit the generation of additional debris but that 's still a really long time especially if a satellite hasn 't been working for years and the understanding is that they will be implemented through national mechanisms nor do they address the debris that 's already up there they 're only in place to limit the future now mount everest is actually an interesting comparison of a new approach to how we interact with our environments tons of rubbish left behind by climbers has started to raise concern and you may have read in the news that there 's speculation that nepal will crack down on mountaineers with stricter enforcement of penalties and legal obligations not for profits will pay climbers who bring down extra waste or expeditions might organize voluntary cleanup trips but that doesn 't mean we shouldn 't do everything in our power to protect the environments that we rely and depend on one that 's out of this world and only at servicing or active deorbiting what if there actually were international laws with teeth that enforced end of life disposal of satellites instead of moving them out of the way as a temporary and that deposit would only be returned if the satellite was disposed of properly or if they cleaned up some quota of debris or maybe a satellite needs to have technology on board to help accelerate deorbit there are some encouraging signs the uk 's launched in two thousand and fourteen for example was designed for this works for the satellite because it 's small but satellites that are higher or in larger orbits or are larger altogether like the size of school buses will require other disposal options so maybe you get into things like high powered lasers or tugging using nets or tethers as crazy as those sound in the short and then one really cool possibility is the idea of orbital tow trucks or space mechanics imagine if a robotic arm on some sort of space tow truck could fix the broken components on a satellite making them usable again or what if that very same robotic arm could refuel the propellant tank on a spacecraft that relies on chemical propulsion just like you or i would refuel the fuel tanks on our cars there 's also complex space laws and politics that we have to sort out and in space exploration there is without doubt congestion in the low earth and geostationary orbits and we cannot keep launching new satellites to replace the ones that have broken down without doing something about them first just like we but also think about the very impact that the satellites have on the environment surrounding earth and help spread the message that together we must reduce our impact earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful and our gateway to exploration it 's up to us to keep it that way"
