  "transcript": "it is interesting that in the united states the most significant health care budget goes to cardiovascular disease care whether it 's private or public there 's no comparison at all in africa where it is a major killer it is totally and that situation cannot be right we must do something about it a health status of a nation parallels development of that nation seventeen million people die every year from heart disease thirty two million heart attacks and strokes occur most of this is in developing countries and the majority is in africa eighty five percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries not in the west and yet ninety percent of the resources are in the west who is at risk that will have reason to be in africa at some point in time should be very concerned you 're having a heart attack what are you going to do europe no you will die fifty percent will die within this is what 's going on by the time you get to fifty it 's almost no one left in nigeria life expectancy is not because some people don 't survive childhood illnesses they do but they do not survive after the time that they reach about forty five years old and fifty years old and those are the times they 're most productive those are the times that they should be contributing to africa 's development you cannot guarantee the security of the african child what are the risk factors it 's very well known i 'm not going to spend a lot of time on those these are just for information hypertension diabetes obesity lack of exercise the usual suspects thirty percent of individuals have hypertension easy to treat look at the situation in mauritius in eight short years we 're here talking we cannot make the mistakes we 've made with malaria and hiv in eight short years that is something to keep in mind we can 't deal with it with situations like this this is a typical african hospital we can 't depend on the elites they go to you can 't depend on foreign aid alone here is the situation you can 't rightly it 's not their responsibility but that is not my expectation we have to look for alternative solutions i 'm here to talk to you about solutions everyone knows the problem no one knows what the solutions are we decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is everyone is ready to throw in money in terms of free money aid to developing countries talk about sustainable investment no one is interested you know we 're going to try to do it in nigeria everyone runs away let me lead you through a day in the life of the heart institute so you get a glimpse of what we do and we have twenty five positions right now all of them board certified in the usa canada or u s and we do it for about ten percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the united states additionally we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of we go for modular units units that easy to repair and because of that we do not take things we manufacture them u s that you 'll get a unit dose for two hundred and fifty dollars when we 're finished manufacturing it in house we come at a price of about two dollars we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and all these problems we 're talking about if we bring development they will all disappear technology is a great equalizer how do we make it work it and we can use expertise in a very smart way this is the way our centers are set up we currently have three locations we will be doing we hope to open in and we will do other centers this model can be adapted to every disease process all the units all the centers are linked through a switched hub to a central server and all the images are you can still be profitable we make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in i 'll lead you through to see how this happens this is at the heart institute the doctors from anywhere can log in i can call you in switzerland and we 'll make the care of the patient have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise i 'm happy to say that the things we have implemented u s practices do not have them and yet the technology is there but you know they have that we don 't have that luxury and they we form which groups record more walking distance by pedometer they will stay with it we have taken care of over including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block for those that understand cardiology complete heart block means certain death we have saved the government of jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to miami or atlanta for care and we 've hopefully saved a lot of lives we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care in the first four 's been three hundred and forty thousand dollars averaging eighty five thousand dollars a month the government will not do that because they have competing needs they need to put resources elsewhere but we can still do it people say how can you do that this is how we can do that at least four thousand rich jamaicans that were heading to miami for treatment have that they did not go to miami because of the heart institute of the caribbean and if they went to miami they will spend significantly more eight to ten times more and they feel happy spending it at home getting the same quality of care it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the we have formed a relationship so that we will train people locally who can repair not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues we 're also starting ancillary health care technology training programs training people in it gives people motivation because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program three months at the heart institute there 's been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training i received here and i think there 's been an increased interest now in particularly in echocardiography since the past two years i received training at this institution i think this aspect of training in cardiology that the heart institute of the caribbean has introduced in jamaica is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases ernest madu the lesson in this is that it can be done and it can be sustained it is not my decision my job is to make sure that every person no matter what fate has assigned to you will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life next stop is west african heart institute we will do other centers and anyone who is interested in doing it in any we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we 've we do this"
