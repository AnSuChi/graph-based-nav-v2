  "transcript": "a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of eleven million documents from a panamanian based law firm called mossack fonseca the release of these papers from panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world we get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to companies like we want an anonymous company can you give us one so you actually get to see the emails you get to see the exchanges of messages you get to see the mechanics now this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions the prime minister of iceland has resigned we 've also had news that an ally of the brutal syrian dictator bashar al assad has also got offshore companies there 's been allegations of a $ two billion money trail that leads back to president vladimir putin of russia this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a john grisham novel it seems very distant from you me ordinary people why should we care about this the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore roads and that affects this expos has been we have the world 's media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets now i think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing and hard to understand how this sort of offshore so you can have one company stacked inside another company stacked inside another company making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures it can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities journalists civil society to really understand what 's going on now that 's not because there are no rich americans who are stashing their assets offshore it 's just because of the way in which offshore works mossack fonseca has fewer american clients i think if we saw leaks from the cayman islands or even from delaware or wyoming or nevada you would see many more cases and examples linking back to americans in fact in a number of us states you need less information you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card that sort of secrecy in america has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren it has allowed scammers to rip off this is the sort of behavior that affects we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice so what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to thirteen manhattan law firms our investigator posed as an african minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the united states to buy a house a yacht a jet now what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator but it really shows the problem with the system it 's also important this is not just this is tax evasion poverty and instability and in order to tackle this this may seem like doom and gloom like there 's nothing we can do about it like nothing has ever changed like there will always be rich and powerful individuals over the last couple of years we 've seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership this issue was put on the political agenda by the uk prime minister david cameron g8 summit that was held in northern ireland in two thousand and thirteen one of the things that is sad is that actually the us is lagging behind there 's bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the house and the senate but it isn 't making as much progress as we 'd like to see so we 'd really want to see the panama leaks this huge peek into the offshore world this is a moment for we need business leaders to stand up and say secrecy like this is not good for business we need political leaders to recognize the problem and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy"
