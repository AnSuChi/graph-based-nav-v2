  "transcript": "plant is called the llareta what looks like moss covering rocks is actually a shrub comprised of thousands of branches each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it it also happens to be a relative of parsley for the past five years i 've been researching working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are two thousand years old and older and i 'm also trying to a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale i selected two thousand years as my minimum age because i wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there what you 're looking at now is a tree called jomon sugi living on the remote island and then i heard about this tree that is two thousand one hundred and eighty years old and knew that i had to go visit it i think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on and perhaps naively i was surprised to find that there isn 't even an area so what you 're looking at here is the rhizocarpon visiting greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north it was very primal and more remote than anything i 'd ever experienced before and this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences one was when i had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord only to find that the archeologists i was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found and it 's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e mail so i was literally left to my own devices but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite where the fish were so abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot long trout with your bare hands and what you 're looking at here is an aerial photo take it is the armillaria is actually a predatory fungus killing certain species of trees in the forest it 's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the humongous fungus so that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood so this strategy has served it pretty well it 's two thousand four hundred years old find this one this is at about sixty feet or eighteen meters depth and you 'll see there 's some damage to the surface of the coral that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it though luckily they lost interest before killing it but that being said we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen what looks like a forest is actually imagine that it 's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system so what you have is one giant interconnected genetically identical individual it also happens to be male and in theory immortal laughter this is a clonal the vegetation zone is actually this is the fortingall yew no i 'm just kidding this is the fortingall yew but i put that slide in there because i 'm often asked if there are any animals in the project and aside the oldest living tortoise so nowhere near two thousand and then you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern iceland that reached four hundred and five it died in the lab as they were determining its age so that being said it 's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild and there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around and we saw a number of them and this is most likely the oldest it 's around two thousand and it 's called the sagole and the baobabs in particular are a great example of this you can see that this one has so the baobabs as they get older tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out and this can create great natural shelters for animals but they 've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses including a bar and this brings me to another favorite of mine i think because it is just so unusual this plant is called the welwitschia and it it 's a primitive conifer you 'll and what looks like two big heaps of leaves is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time i spoke to a biologist at the kirstenbosch botanical garden in capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from and his thought was that if you travel around namibia you see that there are a number of petrified forests and the the logs are all and yet there 's no sign of where they might have come from so and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment this is what i think is the most poetic of the so i spoke to a botanist at the pretoria botanical garden who explained that certain species of trees have adapted imagine that it 's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed the tree can easily recover these also tend to grow clonally the oldest of which is thirteen thousand years old if you 've been in the american west you know the creosote bush is pretty and what 's happening is it 's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape and it 's one again that interconnected root system making it one genetically identical individual well i think they 're friends and it 's a little bit older than twelve thousand years and you see it has that similar circular form and there 's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it live on bureau of land management land and that 's very different from being protected in a national park in fact this land is designated for recreational all terrain vehicle use this is siberian actinobacteria which is between four this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life and what they found by doing research into the permafrost was this bacteria and what that means is that it 's not dormant it 's actually been living and growing for half a million this is a map that i 've put together of the oldest living things so you can get a sense of where they are you see they 're all over the world the blue flags represent things that i 've already photographed and the reds are places that i 'm still trying to get to you 'll see also there 's a flag on antarctica i 'm trying to so i probably have about two more years left on this project on this phase of the project but after five years i really feel like i know what 's at the heart of this work the oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future they 've survived for millennia millennia in desert in the permafrost at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean and they can 't just get up and get out of the way it 's my hope that by going to find these organisms that i can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the thank you"
