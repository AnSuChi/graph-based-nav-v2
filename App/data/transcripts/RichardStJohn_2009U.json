  "transcript": "why do so many people reach success and then fail one but then we get there we figure we 've made and it doesn 't take long to go downhill because it happened to me but then i stopped because i figured oh you know i made it i can just sit back and relax but then i stopped i 'm good enough i don 't need to improve any more reaching success i was was pretty good at coming up with good ideas because i did all these simple things that led to ideas but then i stopped because i figured i was this hot shot guy and i shouldn 't have to work at ideas they should i couldn 't come up with any ideas and suddenly i was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent when i should have been talking to my clients but then i got into stuff that i didn 't love soon a black cloud formed over my head and here i was outwardly very successful but inwardly very depressed but i 'm a guy i knew how to fix it i bought a fast car it didn 't help i was i can buy anything i want but i 'm not happy i 'm depressed 's true what they say and i didn 't believe it until it happened to me but money can 't buy happiness he said no but it can buy prozac and he put me on i couldn 't care less if clients ever called so they took their money and their projects well it didn 't take long for business to drop like a rock because with no employees there was nobody for me to manage so i went back to doing the projects i but in the end and i woke up one day and and i said i don 't need prozac anymore and threw it away and haven 't needed it since"
