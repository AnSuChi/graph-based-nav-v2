  "transcript": "ten years ago it was a routine training jump like many more i 'd done since i became a paratrooper twenty seven years before we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early you do some routine refresher training and then you go to put on your parachute and he 's an experienced nco in parachute operations he checks you out he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your he 's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well then you sit down and you wait a little while because this is the army then you load the aircraft and then you stand up and you get on and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this in a line of people and you sit down on and you wait a little bit longer because this is the air force teaching the army how to wait and it 's painful enough now and i think it 's designed this way it 's painful enough so you want to jump you didn 't really want to jump but you want out so you get in the aircraft you 're flying along and at twenty minutes out these jumpmasters start giving you commands they give twenty minutes that 's a stand up and then you hook up and you hook up your static line and at that point you think hey guess what i 'm probably going to jump there 's no way to get out of this at this point and it was pretty nice outside so nice air comes flowing in and then when it 's time to go a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes go the first guy goes and you 're just in line and you just kind of lumber to the door jump is a you 're caught in the slipstream the first thing you do is lock into a tight body position head down in your chest your arms extended put over your reserve parachute you do that because twenty seven years before and i wasn 't going to test the hypothesis if you don 't get an opening shock you don 't get a parachute you 've got a whole new problem set but typically you do typically it opens and of course boom you 're under a canopy and you say this is good and you really can 't decide where you hit very much because they pretend you can steer but you 're being delivered so you look around where you 're going to land you try to make yourself ready and then as you get close you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line so that it 's not on you when you land and you prepare to do a parachute landing fall now the army teaches you to do five points of performance the toes of your feet your calves your thighs your buttocks and it 's this elegant little and that 's not going to hurt in 30 some years of jumping i never did one i always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window and as soon as i hit the first thing i did is i 'd see if i 'd broken anything that i needed and i 'd ask myself the eternal question why didn 't i go into banking and then i 'd see another paratrooper a young guy or girl and they 'd have pulled out their m4 carbine and they 'd be picking up their they 'd be doing everything that we had taught them and i realized that if they had to go into combat and i was hooked again on the importance of what i did so now 11th two thousand and one and when we drop zone everything had changed and what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very very real but things had changed i was a 46 year old brigadier general but things changed so much that i was going to have to make some significant changes and on that morning i didn 't know it and i also was raised with personal examples of leadership and i was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful they didn 't lie cheat steal or abandon their comrades and i still believe real leaders are like that but in my first twenty five years of career i had a bunch of different experiences one of my first battalion commanders i worked in his battalion for eighteen months and the only conversation he ever had with lt mcchrystal was at mile eighteen and my company did a dawn attack you know the classic dawn attack you prepare all night move to the line of departure and we get wiped out i mean wiped out immediately the enemy didn 't break a sweat doing it they put a big screen up and they take you through everything and then you didn 't do this and you didn 't do this etc and i saw my battalion commander because i had let him down and i went up to apologize to him and he said stanley i thought you did great and in one sentence he lifted me put me back on my feet and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure when nine eleven came mcchrystal sees a whole new world but everything we do is in a different context more importantly the force that i led was spread over more than twenty countries i 've got to use video teleconferences i 've got to use chat i 've got to use email i 've got to use phone calls i 've got to use everything i can not just for operating alone thousands of miles from me and i also have to build we had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations an emerging opportunity came didn 't have time to get everybody together convince them that this was the mission didn and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force rebuild their confidence me and them and them and me entirely new requirement steely eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons in reality much of the force i led looked exactly like you and so instead of giving orders now building consensus and you 're building a sense of shared purpose i went down to to be with a ranger platoon on an operation in afghanistan and on that operation a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team and then at the end i did what i often do with a force like that i asked where were you on nine eleven and one young ranger in the back his hair 's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold afghan wind i was in the sixth grade and it reminded me and yet he has different experiences in many cases a different vocabulary a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than i do and many of the and yet we need to have that shared sense it also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics so how does a leader and it 's a brand new leadership challenge and it forced me to become a lot more transparent a lot more willing to listen a lot more willing to be from lower and yet again you 're not all in one room then another thing there 's an effect and how is he and he said sir he 's fine thanks for asking i said where is he now and he pointed at the screen wife in a firefight in real time and you can 't do anything about it think about knowing that over time and it 's a new cumulative pressure on leaders and you have to watch and take care of each other i probably learned the most about relationships the sinew which hold the force together i grew up much of my career in the ranger regiment and every morning in the ranger regiment you may know one line of it it says i 'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy and it 's not a mindless mantra and it 's not a poem it 's a promise every ranger promises every other ranger no matter what happens no matter what it costs me if you need me i 'm coming and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger and so the organizational relationship that bonds them and i learned personal relationships were more important than ever we were in a difficult operation in afghanistan in two thousand and seven and an old friend of mine that i had spent many years at various points of my career with godfather to one of their kids he sent me a note just in an envelope that had a quote from sherman to grant i knew if i ever got in a tight spot that you would come if alive and having that kind of relationship for me turned out to be critical at many points in my career and i learned that you have to give that in this environment because it 's tough i hope it 's not over i came to believe that a leader isn 't good because they 're right they 're good because they 're willing to learn and to trust this isn 't easy stuff it 's not like that electronic abs machine where fifteen minutes a month you get washboard abs and it isn 't always fair and it hurts and it"
