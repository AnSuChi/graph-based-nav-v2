  "transcript": "i didn 't always make my living from music for about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university this was my day job and i love telling people i did this for a job because everybody always wants to know who are these freaks in real life hello i handed them a flower and some intense eye contact and if they didn 't take the i threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away so i had the most profound encounters with people especially lonely people who looked like they hadn 't talked to anyone and and we would sort of fall in love a little bit and my eyes would say thank you i see you and their eyes would say nobody ever sees me thank you i would get harassed sometimes people would because it made me fear that i was somehow doing something shameful i had no idea how perfect a real education i was getting for the music business on this box for the economists out there you may be interested to know i actually made a pretty predictable income which was shocking to me given i had no regular customers but pretty much sixty bucks on a tuesday ninety bucks on a friday it was consistent and as we started touring i really didn 't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people because i loved it so after all of our shows we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us and i would track down local musicians and artists and they would pass the hat and then they would come in and join us onstage so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird random circus guests so i would need a piano to practice on and an hour later i would be at a fan 's house this is in london food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us this is in seattle this is a library in auckland on saturday i tweeted for this crate and hat because i did not want to schlep them from the east coast and they showed up care of this dude chris from newport beach i once tweeted where in melbourne can i buy a neti pot because i do a lot of couchsurfing everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with clearly making it the better option my crew once pulled our van up to a really poor miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was family were all undocumented immigrants from honduras and that night her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom and i lay there thinking and in the morning her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a bible and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken english your music has helped my daughter so much this is this and i tweeted for a crash pad and at midnight i 'm on the lower east side and it occurs to me i 've never actually done this alone i 've always been with my band or my crew is this what stupid people do and they 're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath and i have had thousands of nights like that and like that i maintain i once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get and as usual the band was psyched but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn 't bring himself to go out there it felt too much like begging and i recognized his fear of is this fair and our music is a cross between punk and cabaret it 's not for everybody maybe it 's for you we sign and there 's all this hype leading up to our next record and it comes out and it sells about twenty five thousand copies in the first and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $ ten bill and he says i 'm sorry i burned your cd from a friend i become the hat after my own gigs but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people and unlike the guy in the opening band i 've actually had a lot of practice standing there bad because i saw it work so i fought my way off my label and i asked my crowd to catch me and the goal was one hundred thousand dollars my fans backed me at nearly one point two million which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date and you can see how many people it is it 's about twenty five thousand people and the media asked amanda the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy how did you make all these people pay for music and the real answer is i didn 't make them i asked them and through the very act of asking and when you connect with them people want to help you it 's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists they don 't want to ask for things but and i got a lot of criticism online after my kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices specifically for asking musicians and this was a doctored image that went up of me and this hurt in a really familiar you 're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling get a job because they weren 't and they couldn 't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them now let me tell you if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers especially if those strangers are drunk german people this was a ninja should i show me celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a the internet and the content that we 're freely able to share on it are taking us back it 's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough i see them as trust but the perfect tools aren 't going to help us if we can 't face each other and give and receive fearlessly but more important to ask without shame my music career so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about and i think when we really see each other which is how do we make people pay for music what if we started asking how do we let people pay for music"
