  "transcript": "it 's a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people 's minds i 'm talking about your language of course instead when you speak you 're actually using a form of telemetry not so different from the remote control device for your television it 's just that whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light your language relies on pulses discrete pulses and just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else 's brain to suit your interests and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that merely by uttering a sound according to that story early humans now god angered at this attempt to usurp his power destroyed the tower and this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there 's something worth now these chimpanzees are using tools and we take that as a sign of and if they really were intelligent why would they crack open nuts with a rock why wouldn 't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts that somebody else had already cracked open for them now the reason the chimpanzees don 't do that is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call social learning they seem to lack the ability to learn from others by copying or imitating or simply watching as a result they can 't improve on others ' ideas or learn from others ' mistakes benefit from others ' wisdom and so they just do the same thing over and over and over again we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanzees would be doing the thing with the same sticks for the termites and the same rocks to crack open the nuts the homo erectus did but if we look at the now if we make some guesses about how long homo erectus lived what their generation time was that 's about forty thousand generations of parents to offspring and other individuals watching in which that hand axe didn 't change it 's not even clear that our very close genetic relatives okay so what this tells us is that contrary the surprise really is that all of the other animals really cannot do that at least not very much and even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it something from a barnum & bailey we can learn we can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do we can then choose from among a range of options the best one and this cumulative cultural adaptation anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives i mean the world has changed out of all proportion my microphone our species can make stuff we can even make the stuff of life as i just said all the stuff around us it turns out that some time around two hundred thousand years ago when our species first arose and acquired social learning but the future course of the entire world and most importantly for this it 'll tell us why we have language and the reason that dilemma arose is it turns out that social learning is visual theft if i can learn by watching you i can steal your best ideas and i can benefit from your efforts without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them if i can watch which lure you use to catch a fish or i can watch how you flake your hand axe to make it better and maybe even catch that fish before you do and in any species that acquired it it would behoove you to hide your best and we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring one of those options was that we could have retreated into small family groups because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge would flow just to our relatives and small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck so if we 'd chosen that path our evolutionary path would have led into the forest and been a short one indeed choosing this option would mean that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom would become available to any one individual than would ever arise from within an individual family or an individual person on their own we chose the second option and language is the result language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation for reaching agreements for striking deals and for and you can see that in a developing society that was beginning to acquire language not having language would be a like a bird without wings and we take this utterly for granted because we 're a species that is so at home with but you have to realize that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in are utterly dependent upon language but you 're hopeless at making the the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached two other people you know are very good at making the wooden so what you do is so what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads and you walk up to the one that can 't speak okay now replay this scene now and you 're approaching the one who has language you put down your arrowheads and say i 'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows i 'll split you fifty fifty the other one says fine looks good to me we 'll do that we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we couldn 't have before we acquired it and this is why our species has prospered around the world while the rest of the animals that 's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extract if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual theft is true any species that acquires it should show an explosion and this is exactly what the archeological record shows now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to and so we prospered in a way that no other animal has language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved it is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised even bizarre but the real puzzle and irony is that the greatest density of different languages on earth is found where people are most tightly packed together if we go to the island of papua new guinea we can find about eight hundred to one thousand distinct human languages different human languages spoken on that island alone and he said to me oh no they 're far closer together than that and so it seems that we use our language not just to cooperate but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside and we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups now i can 't speak for you but it seems to be the case that we don 't have sex with people we can 't talk to now we have to counter that though against the evidence we 've heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the neanderthals and the denisovans okay this tendency we have this seemingly natural tendency we have towards isolation towards keeping to head first into our modern world this remarkable image is not a map of the world in fact it 's a map of our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time and that communication that connectivity around the world that globalization now raises a burden because these different languages impose a barrier as we 've just seen to the transfer of goods and ideas and technologies and wisdom and they impose a barrier to cooperation and nowhere do we see that more clearly than in the european now think of the absurdity of this situation if and in two thousand and seven alone and i 'm sure there are more recent figures something on the order of one point three million pages were translated into english alone alone if language really is the conduit of our cooperation the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas in our modern world we and that question is whether in this globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages to and we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization there are lots and measuring things weighing them and measuring their length but the metric system is winning there are lots and lots of ways of measuring time but a really bizarre our modern world now is confronting us with a dilemma and it 's the dilemma that this chinese man faces who 's language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language and yet he is sitting at his blackboard his actions suggest to us it might be inevitable that we have to confront the idea was also shared in the same form in neanderthals as us do we have any idea how we could have defeated neanderthals if if they also had language is a very good question so many of you will be familiar with the idea that there 's this gene called foxp2 that seems to be implicated in some ways in the fine motor control that 's associated with language the reason why i don 't believe that tells us that the neanderthals had language is here 's a simple analogy but it 's not a ferrari now the simple answer then is that genes alone don 't all by themselves determine the outcome of very complicated things like language what we know about this foxp2 and neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths who knows but that doesn 't tell us they necessarily had language mr"
