  "transcript": "and you 're on the outside you 're at home you 're like the raspyni brothers where you 've got your and and it 's everything you hoped it would be it 's exciting and there 's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it 's over and you want to go back and do it again so within the subject of creation and optimism and if you put creation and optimism together you 've got two choices that you can talk about you can talk about creationism which i think wouldn 't go down instead of a z and i think that 's what i 'd like to talk about today but any kind of conversation about architecture which is in fact what you were just talking about what was going on here setting up at the present time can 't really happen without a conversation about this because what do you do when presented with an opportunity to and our own opportunity rather an brought architecture into focus in a way that i don 't think people had thought of in a long time and made it a subject for common conversation i don 't remember in my 20 year career of practicing and writing about architecture a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning these are just not things we talked about very often it 's talked about all the time at the point where you and so now we 're going to think about architecture in a very different way today there it is looks like that there 's the world trade center site on the front cover they 've made a selection they 've chosen a project by daniel libeskind the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic as you see here he was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of new york was forced to go oh i 'm really sorry we screwed up instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities let 's bring in and so we got this or we had a choice of that oh stop clapping a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it now i don 't know what you think but i think this is a pretty stupid decision but that 's what we 're going to do but i want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that american architecture represents and that these two things talk and that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything that there is a large technical answer that can solve all problems be they social be they physical be they i mean romantic in the sense of there are things larger and grander than us so in the american tradition the difference between the technocratic and the romantic would be the difference between thomas jefferson 's cartesian grids spreading across the united states that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the united states as a a bowing to the in jefferson 's time current popular philosophy of or now which would you rather be a grid and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time i mean it goes on in our private lives too every single day we all want to go out and buy an rather than the real zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle why do you want to do that why do we all want to do that i even in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger sort of more romantic image of where we are so we 're going to go straight into this can i have the lights off for a moment i 'm going to talk about two architects very very briefly that represent the the current split architecturally between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today one very young one a little more mature this is the work of a firm called shop and what you 're seeing here it 's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world it 's sort of a little movie this is just the outline of it and you can see does it look like a regular building no it 's actually non orthogonal it 's not up and down square rectangular anything like that that you 'd see in a normal shape of a building the computer revolution the technocratic technological revolution has allowed us to what 's interesting about it is not the shape what 's interesting about it is how it 's made how it 's made a brand new way to put buildings together something called mass customization no it is not an oxymoron what makes the building expensive in the traditional sense is making they all want to save money by building the same thing five hundred times mass customization works by an architect manufacture these parts the computer then talks to a machine a computer operated machine a cad cam machine that can make a zillion different changes at a moment 's notice because the computer is just a machine it doesn 't care instead of sending someone working drawings which are those huge sets of blueprints that you 've seen your whole life what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions like you used to get when you were a child when you bought little models that and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off site and delivered on a truck to the site to that builder and a set of these instruction manuals just simple bolt a to b and they will be able to put them together here 's the little drawing that tells them how that works these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of ps1 which is a museum in brooklyn new york as part of their young architects summer series and they said well it 's summer what do you do in the summer you go to the beach what do you get you get sand dunes so let 's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune they took photographs they fed the photographs into their computer program and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into at their instructions using standard software with slight modifications piece of wood to be cut all of which were delivered by flat bed on a truck and hand assembled in forty eight hours by a team of eight people only one of whom had ever seen the plans before and here comes dune scape coming up out of the courtyard and there it is fully built there are only sixteen different pieces of wood it has its own built in swimming pool very very cool it 's got little dressing rooms and cabanas where lots of interesting things went on all summer long lest you think that this is only for replacing the bridge that used to go across west street that very important pedestrian connection between the city of new york and the redevelopment of the west side they were asked to design using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts a couple of struts like this some exterior cladding they were able to create that using the same technology here we 're going to walk across the bridge at night it 's self lit you don 't need any overhead lighting so the neighbors don 't complain about metal halide lighting in their face here it is going across and there down the other side and you get the same kind of grandeur now let me show you quickly the opposite if i may this is the work of david rockwell from new york city whose work you can see out here today it 's to seduce you into something that you can do into something that will please you something that will lift your spirits something that will make you feel as if are in another world such as his nobu restaurant in new york which is supposed to take you from the clutter of new york city every single surface of this restaurant is white it 's all this is happening by itself it 's all about sensuality it 's all about touch rosa mexicano restaurant where he transports us to the shores of acapulco up on the upper west side with this wall of cliff divers it 's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn 't have felt good before it 's about bringing nature to the inside"
