  "transcript": "so this is the leading killer of women it 's a closely held secret for reasons i don 't know in addition to making this personal so we 're going to talk about your relationship with your heart and all women 's relationship with their heart we 're going to wax into the politics because the personal as you know is political and not enough is being done about this and as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign this is what we need to do now with heart so where we used to think of heart disease as being a man 's problem primarily which that was never true but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and ' 60s and it was in all the textbooks it 's certainly what i learned when i was training and one of the things that you see is that male line the mortality is going down down down down down and you see the female line since the gap is widening more and more women two three four times more women dying of heart disease than men and that 's too short of a time so what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies which had been developed in men by men for men in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer and the breast cancer campaign again this is not a competition we 're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis now sometimes when people see this i hear this gasp we often can 't think of a young woman who has heart disease i 'm going to tell you why heart disease kills people often very quickly so the first time heart disease strikes in women half of the time it 's sudden cardiac death no opportunity to say good bye no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy no opportunity to help her pick out a wig and that is the forty years that women have advocated nancy reagan stood up and said i 'm and it was okay to talk about it and then physicians have gone to bat we 've done the research we have effective therapies now women are living longer than ever and it 's time we owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women as barbara depicted in one of her amazing movies portrayed a young woman who wanted an education and she wanted to study the talmud and so how did she get educated then she had to impersonate a man she had to look like a man she had to make other people believe that she looked like a man and she could have the same rights that the men had right around that time in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up up up up up she wrote an editorial in the new england journal of medicine and said the yentl syndrome mortality is not going down it 's going up and she questioned she hypothesized is this a yentl syndrome they don 't look like that male pattern heart disease that we 've spent the last fifty years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics they don 't get detected they don 't get the benefit of all the modern medicines doctor healy then subsequently became the first female director of our national institutes of health and this is the biggest biomedical enterprise and it funds a lot of my research it funds research all over the place so a tremendous fund of knowledge despite again that so many people told her not to do it it was too expensive and the women aren 't worth it she was like nope sorry women are worth it well there was a little piece of that women 's health initiative that went to national heart lung and blood institute which is the cardiology part of the nih and we got to do the wise study and the wise stands for women 's ischemia syndrome evaluation and i have chaired this study for the last fifteen years it was a study to specifically ask what 's going on with why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease so in the wise fifteen years ago we started out and said well wow there 's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that and our colleagues in washington d c had recently published that when women heart attacks and die compared to men who have heart attacks and die and again this is millions of people happening every day women in their fatty plaque and this is their coronary artery so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle women erode men explode you 're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology so i 'll describe the male pattern heart attack first hollywood heart attack ughhhh horrible chest pain ekg goes pbbrrhh and they go up to the cath lab and boom boom boom doesn 't completely fill with clot symptoms are subtle ekg findings are different female pattern so we picked up on that and we said you know we now have the ability to look inside human beings with these special catheters called ivus intravascular ultrasound and we said we 're going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is actually probably different and deposited differently than men and because of the the common knowledge of how women and men get fat when we watch people become men get fat so we said look women look like they 're pretty good about putting kind of the garbage away smoothly putting it away men just have to dump it in a single area so we so the yellow is the fatty plaque and panel a is a man and you can see it 's lumpy bumpy he 's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries panel b is the woman very smooth she 's just laid it down nice and tidy laughter and if you did that angiogram which is the red you can see the man 's disease so fifty years of honing and crafting these kind of hard to see that female pattern disease so that was a discovery now so we are working now on a non invasive again these are all invasive studies ideally you would love so this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging we 're doing this at the cedars sinai heart institute in the women 's heart center we selected this for the research this is not in your community hospital but we would hope to translate this and we 're about two and a half years into a five year study this was the only modality that can see the and that is microvascular obstruction the syndrome the now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction or obstruction the second reason we really liked mri is that there 's no radiation so unlike the cat scans whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation we say do we really need that test but this is an area of active inquiry where actually studying women is going to advance the field for women and men what are the downstream consequences then heart disease is not recognized despite these good treatments that we know so she looks like barbara in the movie and when you have female pattern and you look like a woman as barbara does here with her husband life saving treatments and those little red boxes are deaths and why we think the yentl syndrome actually is is explaining a lot of these gaps if you ask what is the big difference between women and men physiologically why are there women because women so we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs which is one of the things that we 're trying to do with stem cell therapy these are female and male stem cells or do you want these guys that look like they 're out to lunch and some of our investigative teams have demonstrated that female stem cells and this is in animals and increasingly we 're showing this in humans do better than male stem cells going into a male body one of the things that we say about all of this female physiology because again as much as we 're talking about women and heart disease women do on average have better longevity than men so this is not a zero sum game in anyway okay and remember paths crossed in and eighty four and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease what has happened in the last fifteen years with this work so just like the breast cancer story doing research getting awareness going it works you just have to get it going now are we happy with this we still have two to three more women dying for every man and i would propose with the better longevity that women have so this is where we are but we have a long row to hoe we 've worked on this for fifteen years and i 've told you we 've been working on male pattern heart disease for fifty years so we 're thirty five years behind and we 'd like to think it 's not going to take thirty five years and so what do we need to do you now hopefully have a more personal relationship with your heart women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns the women are very good about getting mammograms now and women do fundraising women participate they have put their money where their mouth and it 's political so i implore you to join the red dress campaign in this fundraising but heart disease kills a whole bunch more so if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge we have a lot of lives to save so thank you for your attention"
