  "transcript": "i 'm interested in how many are three to twelve years old try not to go extinct that 's it people ask me a lot in fact one of the most asked questions i get is why do children like so that 's sort of the theme big different and gone the title of my now i assume that we remember dinosaurs and there 's lots of different shapes lots of different kinds a long time ago back in the early they went out and gathered them up and this is an interesting story every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had so if the museum in toronto went out and collected so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs and some scientists were sitting around and they thought what in the world look at these dinosaurs they 're all big where are all the little ones laughter and they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it where are the go to a museum you 'll see see how many baby dinosaurs there are people assumed and this was actually a problem people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs if they had juvenile you 'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur and it comes down to a couple of things first off and scientists like to name dinosaurs everybody likes to have their own and so every time they found something that looked a little different they named it something different and what happened of course is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs a light went on in somebody 's head dr peter dodson at the university of pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs which is different than the way he used or any of the birds that have crests on their grow to about eighty percent adult size before the crest starts to grow so allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth you would think they were two different animals so this was a problem and peter dodson pointed this out using some duck billed dinosaurs then called hypacrosaurus and he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it it would have a crest about half the size of the adult but the actual sixty five percent had no crest at all so this was interesting so this is this is where people taken that taken peter dodson 's work and gone on with that then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have and so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur or any animal is a young one or an older one but cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do as you can imagine because in museums bones are precious you go into a museum and they take really good care they 're very well taken care of they don 't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside so they don 't normally let you do that but so that 's what i do if you cut open a little dinosaur it 's very spongy inside like a and if you cut into an older dinosaur it 's very massive you can so what i want to do is show you these in north america in the northern plains of the united states and the southern and so we will evaluate them and that 's sort of what i 've been doing so my students my staff we 've been now as you can imagine cutting open a leg bone is one thing but when you go to a museum and say you don 't mind if i cut open your dinosaur 's skull do you and we want to look at these three first so these are dinosaurs that are called and the assumption is that they 're related like cousins or whatever but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are pachycephalosaurus has a big and then stygimoloch another dinosaur from the same age lived at the same time and then there 's this thing called dracorex so no dome nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike but they did look at these three and they said these are three different dinosaurs and dracorex is probably the most primitive of them and the other one is more primitive than the other it 's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out but if you line them up if you just take those three skulls and just line them up pachycephalosaurus is the largest one and one would think that should give me a clue laughter but it didn 't give them a clue because scientists like to name things so i mean so it is going to get bigger if you cut open stygimoloch it is doing the same thing the dome that little dome is growing really fast it 's inflating very fast what 's interesting is which means they 're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger and if we look at pachycephalosaurus pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and so just with these three dinosaurs as a scientist we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal of course means we have ten primary dinosaurs to deal with the 1800s before two thousand no one had ever seen a juvenile triceratops so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum and everybody says it 's because i have a little museum when you have a little museum you look at the triceratops you can see it 's changing they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do and then because the juveniles are in my collection i cut them open and the middle size one is really spongy but what was interesting was the adult triceratops was also spongy and this is a skull that is two meters long but there 's another dinosaur that is found in this formation except it 's bigger and it 's called torosaurus but it 's got these big holes in its a triceratops and a torosaurus can 't possibly be the same animal because one of them 's bigger than the other one and it has holes in its frill and i said well do we have any juvenile torosauruses and they said well no but it has holes in its frill so one of my graduate students looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in triceratops and of course it 's open in torosaurus so he found the transitional ones so now we know that torosaurus is actually a grown up when we name anything the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out so triceratops if you 've heard the news a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong they thought torosaurus should be kept and triceratops thrown out but that 's not going to so we look at the bone histology the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile or at least a subadult and the other one is is is an adult and we have an ontogeny and we get rid of anatotitan so we can just keep doing this and the last one is t rex so there 's these two dinosaurs they had a good question they were looking at them and they said one 's got seventeen teeth and the biggest one 's got twelve teeth and that doesn 't make any sense at all because we don 't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older so it must be true they must be different so we cut into them and sure enough nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone it i have four t rexes so but i didn 't have to cut any of them really because i just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had twelve teeth and the next smallest one had thirteen and the next smallest had fourteen and of course nano has seventeen and we just went out and looked at other people 's collections and we found one that real easy to say that tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus and therefore we can take out another dinosaur so and that 's a good number that 's a good number to go extinct i think now as you can imagine this is not very popular with they 're not happy with this thank you very much"
