  "transcript": "came into the forest under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously she was the wife of an even more famous brahmin to watch her better the one eyed monkey climbed onto the tree just then with a loud bang the heavens opened and the god indra jumped into the clearing a sekhri ah hah the woman paid him no heed then indra disappeared he realized at once what had happened so she retold events exactly as they had vishnu gave his judgment the god indra has sinned in that he has sinned against and performed the sacrifice of the horse and so it transpired that a horse was killed a god was made and a one eyed monkey was left very confused at what we humans call justice in india there is a rape every three minutes in india only twenty five percent of rapes and of these twenty five percent that come to a police station convictions are only in four percent of the that 's a lot of women who don 't get justice look around you look at your own countries there is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes it 's mostly aboriginals who are in jail if you 're in india it 's either muslims or adivasis our tribals the naxalites if you 're in 's mostly the blacks always get to tell their truth as the truth so have we all become i have told this story close to five hundred and fifty times in audiences in forty countries to school students to black tie dinners at the smithsonian and so on and so forth and every time it hits something now if i were to go into the same crowd and say i want to lecture you about justice and injustice thank you very much we have other things to do and that is the astonishing power of art because it breaks through your prejudices breaks through everything that you have as your mask that says i am this i am that i am that no it breaks through those and it reaches somewhere where other things don 't and in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change we need a language that reaches through hitler knew it he used wagner to make all the nazis feel wonderful and aryan they also know the power of the arts when i was a young child my mother who was a choreographer came upon a phenomenon that worried her and she created a dance piece which then prime minister nehru saw he came to talk to her and said what is this about she told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call dowry dance many years later when i was working with the director peter brook in the mahabharata playing this feisty feminine i had similar experiences big fat black mamas in the bronx used to come and say hey girl that 's it and then these trendy young things in the sorbonne would say madame draupadi on n 'est pas feministe mais a a and then aboriginal women in africa would come and say this is it and i thought this is what we need so what do they do they drink the water they know is dirty they get cholera they get diarrhea they get jaundice and they die have not been able to provide clean water well somebody and it was a simple idea it was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help most houses in asia and india have a cotton garment why aren 't governments blaring this on television why isn 't it on every poster across the third world and here is one of the ways we get it to people while universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at whether it 's so why are we not doing something to actually that problem on a day to day basis what are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we and that there are other ways of actually here is one such way one of the gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can 't even afford to give them food has been used across the world to talk about social issues a few years ago we had a film called rang de basanti which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change in venezuela one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called crystal and when onscreen crystal got breast so why is it that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world we need a more just world why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers that we can reach what i need to say to the planners of the world the governments the strategists is you have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake it needs to be the yeast because any future planning if two thousand and forty eight is when we want to get there unless the arts are put with the scientists with the economists with prepare for the future badly we 're not going to get there and unless this is actually internalized it won 't happen so what is it that we require what is it that we need we need to break down our vision of what planners are of what the correct way of a path is and to say all these years of trying to make a better world and we have failed there are more people being raped there are more wars there are more people dying of simple things so once there was a princess who whistled beautifully her father the king said don 't whistle her mother the queen said hai don 't whistle but the princess continued whistling the years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman who whistled even more beautifully her father the king said who will marry a whistling princess her mother the queen said who will marry a whistling princess he invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and i am going to go to each of these young men and i am going to ask them if they defeated correctly and if somebody answers that shall be my wish so she went up to each and said do you accept that i have defeated you"
