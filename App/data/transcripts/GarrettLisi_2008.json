coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal each coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps these polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question we can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors or what he would tell us that our question was completely stupid these corals can be kind of mean you see and i have surfing scars to prove that but this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him that he was in all these other locations but experiencing them as separate individuals and it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities just like a coral schrdinger and his cat the cat likes this version better in this setup schrdinger is in a box with a radioactive sample branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not but in the other branch of reality he remains alive these realities are experienced separately by each individual as far as either can tell the other one doesn 't exist it 's as if each of us like schrdinger here are a kind of coral the mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales it can be summed up in a single sentence but this does not mean everything happens the rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can what physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced what they are and how this balance works in this machine a beam of protons and and antiprotons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a we can 't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized but physics does tell us what particles can be produced these particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and antiproton any particles more massive than this energy limit aren 't produced and remain invisible to us this is why this new particle but before talking about what we might see let me describe the particles we already know of most of us are familiar with electrons a lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around but the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino with no electric charge and a very tiny mass in contrast the up and down quarks have very large masses and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms and have antiparticle partners that carry opposite charges these familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses these matter particles all the electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons rather unimaginatively the weak force that interacts only with left handed matter the strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge called color charge and come in three different varieties red green and blue you can blame murray gell mann for these names they 're his fault which interacts with matter via its mass and spin the most important thing to understand here is that there 's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces these four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has but we 're pretty sure exists is the higgs particle and i 'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk now if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges there are two hundred and twenty six that 's a lot of particles to keep track some beautiful patterns emerge the so when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton it has a total electric charge of plus one hypercharge and weak charge the electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their this is called the unified electroweak model and it was put together back in the reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the higgs particle it makes the we can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero all four charge directions at this point anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero for example this weak force particle and its antiparticle can be created in a collision in further interactions the charges must always balance one of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an antineutrino and these three still add to zero total charge nature always keeps a perfect perfect balance so these patterns of charges are not just pretty which has this nice hexagonal symmetry in a strong interaction a strong force particle interacts with a colored quark such as this green one to give a quark with a different color charge we can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force when we include these each matter particle has two different spin charges spin up and spin down so they all split and give a nice pattern in we can rotate this pattern in six dimensions and see that it 's quite pretty this pattern some of these particles are at the very limit of what we 've been able to reach with experiments from this pattern we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales the way the universe works at these tiny scales is very beautiful we want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe and we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we 'll see when experiments reach higher energies so there 's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges which is not very symmetric could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken similar to how the higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism when we introduce a new direction and then we can rotate it in with the others we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions this particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory this is the way theories of unification work a physicist looks for larger more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset the larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen which should act a lot like the weak force only weaker the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six dimensional charge space as the first generation these particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges they sit on top of one another in the standard charge space then we can then we can spin these in eight dimensions and see what the whole pattern looks like related to the first generation by a symmetry called triality this particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics it 's a pattern of the largest exceptional lie group e8 this lie group is a smooth curved shape with two hundred and forty eight dimensions each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape one small part of this e8 shape can be used to describe the curved space time of einstein 's general relativity explaining gravity the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales the pattern of this shape living in eight dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape as we spin it we can see many of the we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis there are twenty gaps where new particles should be two of which have been filled by the it 's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable and this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new in one thousand six hundred and twenty three galileo wrote this which stands continually open to our gaze is written in the language of mathematics without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it circles and other geometrical figures the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth but it 's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure beautiful geometry joined with quantum mechanics this mathematics describes our universe as a growing e8 coral and as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the large hadron collider we may be able to see whether nature this process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in e8 pattern that will be very very cool if the lhc finds new particles but they don 't fit this pattern well that will be very interesting but bad for this e8 theory and of course bad for me personally pretty bad this theory and others like it are long shots one does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won 't end up being true about that 's what doing theoretical physics is like there are a lot of wipeouts in this regard new physics theories are a lot like start up companies it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn 't working out but in science if something isn 't working you have to toss it out and try something else now the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life best i can to live a balanced life laughter i try to balance my life equally between physics love and surfing my own three charge directions a very beautiful place now it 's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how i managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full time employment i 'm going and this is another that 's because this used to be my home and office on maui but not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love living a nomadic existence has been hard at times but it 's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that i 've been happy with it allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out thank you very much 's got a few people at least excited is because if you 're right it brings gravity and quantum theory together so are you saying that we should think of the universe at its heart that the smallest things that there are are somehow i mean is there a scale to it at the smallest scale right now the pattern i showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics and that 's the one that i said we knew for certain and that shape has remarkable similarities high dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience and that that would would be what explains all these in terms of much smaller strings vibrating i know you don 't like string theory vibrating inside it how should we think of an electron so what 's happening is as the shape is moving over space time it 's twisting and the direction it 's twisting as it moves is what particle we see it would be ca the size of the e8 shape how does that relate to the electron i feel like i need that for my picture is it bigger is it smaller gl as far as we know electrons are point particles so the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is all possibilities are expanding and developing at once and this is why i use the analogy to coral and in this way the way that e8 comes in is it will be as a shape that 's attached at each point in the space time and as i said the way the shape twists the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface is what the elementary particles are themselves it doesn 't really matter it 's evoking a kind of sense of wonder and i certainly want to understand more of this but thank you so much for coming that was absolutely fascinating"
