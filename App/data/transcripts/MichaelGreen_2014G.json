  "transcript": "a young man delivered a report to the united states congress still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today the lives of everyone on this planet that young man wasn 't a politician he wasn 't a businessman a civil rights activist or a faith leader he was that most unlikely of heroes his name was what we know best as gross domestic product gdp gdp has defined and shaped our lives for the last eighty years and today i want to talk about a different way to measure the success of countries but first we have to understand how gdp came to dominate our lives kuznets ' report was delivered a moment of crisis the u s economy was plummeting into the great depression so what kuznet 's report gave them was updated year by year ' invention was found to be so useful it spread around the world and now today every country produces gdp statistics but in that first report kuznets himself delivered a warning it 's in the introductory chapter on page seven he says the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above it 's not the greatest sound bite in the world it 's not a measure of our well being and it shouldn 't be a guide to all decision making but we have ignored kuznets ' warning we live in a world where gdp is the benchmark of success in a global economy our politicians boast when gdp goes up markets move and trillions of dollars of our societies have become engines to create more gdp but we know that gdp is flawed it counts bombs and prisons as progress it can 't count and it has nothing to say about fairness or justice we need a better way to measure our societies a measure based on the am i safe do i live in a society where i 'm not discriminated against is my future and the future of my children prevented from environmental there have of course been efforts in the past to move beyond gdp but i believe that we 're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution we 're ready because we 've seen in the financial crisis of two thousand and eight how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray we 're ready because today we have the technology to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to it 's a whole new way of looking at the world the social progress index begins by defining what it means to be a good society the first is does everyone have the basic needs for survival food education information health and sustainable environment and then third does every individual have access to a chance to pursue their goals and dreams and ambitions free from freedom from discrimination and access to the the world 's most advanced knowledge and for each of these twelve components we have indicators to measure how countries are performing not indicators of effort or intention but real achievement but what you want to know is who 's top don 't you laughter i knew that i knew that i knew that okay higher is better and then just for comparison just for fun on the horizontal axis is gdp per capita so the country in the world with the highest social progress i 've never been maybe next year new zealand has a higher gdp than chad well made but let me show you two other countries and then here 's senegal but the same there we go lots of dots now obviously i can 't do all of them so a few highlights for you the highest ranked g7 country is canada but who cares at least we beat the french and then looking at the emerging economies top of the brics pleased to say china tucked away on on the right hand side you will see a dot of a country with a lot of gdp but not a huge amount of social progress that 's kuwait just above brazil is a social progress superpower my slide is getting a so this shows the average relationship between gdp and social progress the first thing to notice is that there 's lots of noise around the trend line and what this shows what this empirically demonstrates is that gdp is not destiny risks of less so what this tells us is that if poor countries can get a little bit of extra gdp and if they reinvest that in and then we see it flattening out each extra dollar of gdp is buying less and and with more and more of the world 's population living on this part of the curve it means gdp is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development of brazil here 's brazil social progress of about seventy out of one hundred brazil 's above the line brazil is doing a reasonably good job of turning gdp into social progress but where does brazil go next it 's less than half a plan it 's possible to so it becomes more like new zealand and what that means is that brazil needs to prioritize social progress in its development plan and see that it 's not just growth alone with our here in brazil we launched the first subnational social progress index we did it for the amazon region it 's an area the size of europe twenty four million people one of the most deprived parts of the country and with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country imazon and other partners from government business and civil society and this is just the beginning you can create a social progress contrary to the way we sometimes talk about it gdp was not handed down from god on tablets of stone it 's a measurement tool invented in the 20th century to address the challenges of the aging obesity climate change and so on we need new tools of measurement new ways of valuing progress in people 's lives"
