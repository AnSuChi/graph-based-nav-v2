  "transcript": "this is an interview with a difference on the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words what i did was i asked bill and melinda to dig out from their archive some images that would help explain some of what they 've done do do a few things that way so we 're going to start when and where was this and who is that handsome man next to you melinda gates with those big glasses huh and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see the savanna it was incredible bill had never taken that much time off from work but what really touched us actually were the people and the extreme poverty we started asking ourselves questions does it have to be like this and at the end of the trip we went out to zanzibar and took some time to walk on the beach which is something we had done a lot while we and we 'd already been talking about during that time that the wealth that had come from microsoft would be given back to society but it was really on that beach walk that we started to talk about well what might we do and how might we go about it ca so given that this vacation led to the creation of the world 's biggest private foundation it 's pretty expensive as vacations go i think we were excited that there 'd be a phase of our life where we 'd get to work together and figure out how to give this money back at this stage we were talking about the poorest and could you have a big impact on them were there things that weren 't being done there was a lot we didn 't know our navet is pretty incredible when we look back on it but we had a certain enthusiasm that that would be the the phase the post microsoft phase would be our our which bill always thought was going to come after he was sixty so he hasn 't quite hit sixty yet so some things change along the we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world and we kept saying to ourselves well that can 't be in the u s you just go down to the drug store and so we started gathering scientists and started learning about population learning about vaccines learning about what had worked 've got a big pot of money and a world full of so many different issues how on earth do you decide what to focus on bg well and countries that were really stuck because level of death and parents would have so many kids that they 'd get huge population growth and that the kids so that was our global thing and then and we saw that and everything the foundation does is focused there ca so i asked each of you to pick an image that that you like that illustrates your work and melinda this is what you picked what 's this about mg so i one of the things i and i kept hearing from women over and over and over the more i traveled i want to be able to use this shot i would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines and they would bring the conversation around to but what about and i would come back and talk to global health experts and they 'd say oh no contraceptives are stocked in in the developing world well you had to dig deeper into the reports and this is what the team came to me with which is to have the number one thing that women tell you in africa they want to use stocked out more than two hundred days a year explains why women were and i got to the clinic and there was nothing there and so condoms were stocked in in africa because of all the aids work that the u s and others supported but women will tell you over and over again i can 't negotiate a condom with my husband i 'm either suggesting he has aids and i need that tool because then i can space the births of my children and i can feed them and have a chance of educating them ca melinda you 're roman catholic and you 've and on the abortion question on both sides really how do you navigate that mg so i think that 's a really important which is we had backed away from contraceptives as a global community we knew that two hundred and ten million women were saying they wanted access to contraceptives even the contraceptives we have here in the united states and we weren 't providing them because of the political controversy in our country and i kept looking around trying to find the person that would and i shouldn 't let that controversy be the thing that holds us back we used to have consensus in the united states around contraceptives and so we got back to that global consensus and actually raised two point six billion dollars around exactly this my graph has numbers on it i really like this graph this is the the number of children who die before the age of five every year and what you find is really a phenomenal success story which is not widely known that we are making incredible progress we go from twenty million not long after i was born to now we 're down to about six million so this is a story smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year that was eradicated so that got down to zero measles was killing a couple million a year that 's down to a few hundred thousand is a chart where you want to get that that we can actually accelerate the progress the last decade that number has dropped faster and use the very understanding of these things and get the delivery right that we can perform a miracle ca i mean you do the math on this and it works out i think literally to thousands of kids ' lives saved every day compared to the on it 's a kid one kid at a time ninety eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters and yet people 's charity when they see a natural disaster are wonderful it 's incredible how people think okay that could be me and the money flows these causes have been a bit invisible now that the millennium development goals and various things are getting out there we are seeing some increased generosity goal is to get this well below a million which should be possible in in our lifetime ca maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big sad face to to get engaged i mean you 've used it in your letter this year you used basically this argument to say that aid contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken that actually it has been effective take there is some aid that was well meaning and didn 't go well there 's some venture capital investments that were well meaning and didn 't go well you shouldn 't just say okay because of that this is a bad endeavor you should look at what was your how are you trying to uplift nutrition and survival and literacy we can do better than venture capital i think including big hits like this ca traditional wisdom is that it 's pretty hard for married couples to work together how have you guys managed had a lot of women say to me i really don 't think i could work with my husband that just wouldn 't work out you know we enjoy it and we don 't and we don 't travel together as much for the foundation actually as we used to bill was working at microsoft we have more trips where we 're traveling separately but i always know when i come home bill 's going to be interested in what i learned whether it 's about women or girls or something new about the vaccine delivery chain or this person that is a great leader i 'm really interested and i think we have a really collaborative you were basically largely running the show six years ago i guess bill came on full time so moved from microsoft and became full time that must have been hard adjusting to there was way more angst for them than there was for me about bill coming i was actually really excited i mean bill made this decision even obviously before it got announced in two thousand and six and it was really his decision but again it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea yes the foundation employees had angst about that eleven o 'clock you 're away from work what comes up what 's the argument bg i had it with steve ballmer as microsoft got bigger and now melinda in even stronger equal ways is the partner so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to which groups are working well so there 's a lot of collaboration i can 't think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or so bill can look at the big data and say i want to act based on these global statistics for me i come at it from intuition i meet with lots of people on the ground and bill 's taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match and i think what i 've taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand can you actually deliver that vaccine can you get a woman to accept those polio drops in her child 's mouth because the delivery piece is every bit as important as the science so i think it 's been more a coming to over time towards each other 's point of view and quite frankly the work is better because of it ca so in vaccines and polio and so forth you 've had some amazing successes we do a lot of drug work or vaccine work that you know you 're going to have maybe a few of those will work out we were very nave certainly i was about a turns out it took fortunately we found out that if you go kill the sand flies you probably can have success there but we spent five years you could say wasted five years and about sixty million on a path that turned out to have very modest benefit the story of what 's gone right there is quite a long and complex one there any failures that you can talk about mg well i would say a huge lesson for us out of the early work is we thought that these small schools were the answer and small schools definitely help they bring down the dropout rate they have less violence and crime in those schools but the thing that we learned from that work and what turned out to be the fundamental key is a great teacher in front of the classroom if you don 't have an effective teacher in the i don 't care how big or small the building is you 're not going to change the trajectory of whether that student will be ca so melinda this is you and your eldest daughter jenn and we did something very different which is we decided to go spend two nights and three days with a family anna and sanare are the parents they invited us to come and stay in their boma and the difference between just going and visiting for half a day or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was profound and so let me just give you one explanation of that and as i talked to anna in the kitchen we cooked for about five hours in the cooking hut that day and as i talked to her she had absolutely planned and spaced with her husband the births of their children but they had decided to get married they clearly had respect and love in the relationship their children their six children the two in the middle were twins thirteen a boy and a girl named grace and at night though when all the lights went out in rural tanzania and there was no moon that night the first night and no stars and jenn came out of our hut with her rei little headlamp on grace went immediately and got the translator came straight up to my jenn and said when you go home can i have your headlamp so i can study at night ca oh wow mg and her dad had told me how afraid he was that unlike the son who had passed his secondary exams because of her chores she 'd not done so well and wasn 't in the government school yet he said i don 't know how i 'm going to pay for her education i can 't pay for private school and she may end up on this farm like my wife so they know the difference that an education can make in a huge profound way ca i mean bringing up three children when you 're the world 's richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art what 's been your approach bg well i 'd say overall the kids get a great education but you 've got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they 're going to go and do and our philosophy has been to be very clear with them most of the money 's going to the foundation and help them find something they 're excited about we want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they and so far they 're fairly diligent excited to you 've obviously guarded their privacy carefully for obvious reasons i 'm curious why you 've given me permission to show this picture now here at ted mg well it 's interesting as they get older they so know that our family belief is about responsibility and i think paul farmer is probably going to put it but they really care deeply about the mission of the foundation too ca we read an article long actually before we got married where warren buffett talked about that and we 're quite convinced that it wasn 't a favor either to society or or to speaking of warren buffett something really amazing happened in two thousand and six when somehow your only real rival for richest person in america suddenly turned around and agreed to give eighty percent of his i guess there 's a long version and a short version of that we 've got time for the short version bg all right well warren was a close friend he was going to have his wife suzie and he said ca tweet that bg if he 's got somebody who is doing something well and is willing to do it at no charge it has been unbelievable it 's allowed us to half the resources we have come from warren 's you 've pledged that by the time you 're done more than or ninety five percent of your wealth will be given to the foundation you and warren have been going around trying to persuade other billionaires and successful people to pledge to give what more than half of their assets how is that going bg well we 've got about one hundred and twenty people who have now taken this giving pledge the thing 's great is that we get together yearly and talk about okay do you hire staff what do you give to them we 're not trying to homogenize it i mean the beauty of philanthropy is this mind blowing diversity people give to some things we look and go wow but that 's great that 's the role of philanthropy is to pick different approaches including even in one we need more experimentation but it 's been wonderful meeting those people sharing their journey to philanthropy how they involve their kids where they 're doing it differently and it 's been way more successful than we expected now it looks like it 'll just keep growing in size in the in the years ahead having people see that other people are making change with philanthropy i mean these are people who have created their own businesses put their own ingenuity behind incredible they can change the world and they start to see others doing it and saying wow i want to do that with my own money to me that 's the piece that 's incredible ca it seems to me it 's actually really hard for some people to figure out even how to remotely spend that much money on on something else there are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people i 'm curious can you and you can 't take it with you and if it 's not good for your kids let 's get together and brainstorm about what we can be done the world is a far better place because of the philanthropists of the and the u s tradition here which is the strongest is the envy of the world and part of the reason i 'm so optimistic is because i do think philanthropy is going to grow and take some of these things government 's not just good at working on and discovering and and shine some light in the right direction ca dent both in that problem and certainly in the perception of that problem is that a fair comment bg oh yeah if you take from the most wealthy and give to the least wealthy it 's good it tries to balance out and that that 's just mg but you change systems in the u s we 're trying to change the education system so it 's just for everybody and it works for all students i really think that most people here and many millions around the world are just in awe of the trajectory your lives have taken and the the spectacular thank you so much for coming"
