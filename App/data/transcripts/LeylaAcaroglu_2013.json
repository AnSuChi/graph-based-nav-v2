  "transcript": "and you get given the option for a plastic or a paper shopping bag okay let 's think of why it 's reusable in some cases it 's recyclable so when people are looking at the plastic bag it 's likely they 're thinking of something like this which we all know is absolutely terrible and we should be avoiding at all expenses these kinds of environmental damages but people are often not thinking of something like this is the other end of the spectrum when we produce materials we need to extract them from the environment and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts and i and it 's how you use the material that dictates the environmental impact so what happens is we have to rely on some sort of intuitive framework when we make decisions so i like to call that intuitive framework our environmental folklore it 's either the little voice at the back of your head so when you 've picked the paper bag or when you 've bought a fuel efficient car but how do we know if we 're actually reducing the net environmental and this is really hard because we have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed society we have the industrial systems which is essentially the entire economy and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system and i would argue the most important the ecosystem but the choices that we make in every single job that we have no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order has an impact on all of these systems and the thing is that we have to find ways if we 're actually going to address sustainability of interlocking those complex systems and making better choices that result in net environmental gains so we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face and that 's where this process called life cycle thinking comes in and we use this scientific process called life cycle assessment or in america you guys say life cycle analysis in order to have a clearer picture of how everything that we do in the technical part of those systems affects the natural environment and at every the things that we do have an interaction with the natural environment and we can monitor how that interaction is actually affecting the systems and services that make life on earth possible and we 've busted a bunch of myths so to start with and it 's used a lot i think in our conversation when we 're talking about sustainability and that 's the word biodegradability now biodegradability is a material property is not a definition of environmental benefits allow me to explain when something natural its little carbon molecules that it stored up as it was growing are naturally released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide most of the things the waste that we produce end up in landfill it 's got no oxygen it 's tightly compacted and hot those same molecules they become methane and methane is a but we need to be smart about this we need to identify how we can start to leverage because right now what people do is they turn around and they say let 's ban plastic bags we 'll give people paper because that is better for the environment but if you 're throwing it in the bin and your local landfill facility is just a normal one then we 're having what 's called a double negative i and so i 'm absolutely fascinated by consumer goods and how the consumer goods that we have kind of become immune to that fill our lives now america has this amazing ability to keep growing refrigerators in the last few years they 've grown one cubic foot on average i mean i have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years all right and so what happens is we waste more food and as i was just explaining food waste is a problem in fact here in the forty percent of food purchased for the home is wasted i don 't want to make it so simplistic but the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this and one of the features of is the crisper drawer you all got crisper drawers the drawer that you put your lettuces in lettuces have a habit of going soggy in the crisper drawers don 't they okay so this is a problem people these poor little lettuces are getting thrown out left right and center because the crisper drawers are not designed to actually keep things crisp okay you need a tight environment you need like an airless environment to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally but the crisper drawers they 're just a drawer with a slightly better seal anyway i 'm clearly obsessed don 't ever invite me over because i 'll just start going through your refrigerator and looking at all sorts of things like that but essentially this is a big because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system not only do we have that impact i just explained at the end of life but we actually have had to grow that lettuce the life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical we 've had to clear land we 've had to plant seeds phosphorus fertilizers nutrients water sunlight all of the embodied impacts in that lettuce get lost from the system which makes it a far bigger environmental impact we could start with the crisper drawer and the size for those of you in the room who do design fridges that would be great the problem is imagine if we actually started to reconsider how sign of modernity but we actually haven 't really changed the design of them that much since the but essentially they 're still big boxes cold boxes that we store stuff in so imagine if we actually really started to identify these problems and use that as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant design solutions that will solve those imagine if we designed fridges that halved that another item that i find fascinating is the electric tea kettle which i found out that you don 't do tea kettles in this country really do you but that 's percent of households in the united kingdom own an electric tea kettle usually ask me two things they 'd say leyla how do i make it technically efficient because obviously energy 's a problem with this product or how do i make it green how do i make the materials green well i 'd say you 're looking at the wrong problems because the problem is with use it 's with how people use the product sixty five percent of brits admit to over filling their kettle when they only need one cup of tea all of this extra water that 's being boiled requires energy and it 's been and they 're so ubiquitous you don 't even notice they 're this guy over here though he does he 's named simon simon works for the national electricity company in the u k he has a very important job of monitoring all of the electricity coming into the system he 's also watching television because everybody turns their kettles on at the same time so imagine if you designed kettles you actually found a way to solve these system failures because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system just because the product hasn 't thought about the problem that it 's going to have when it exists in the world now i looked at a number of kettles available on the market and found the minimum fill lines so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there was between two and a five and a half cups of water just to make one cup of tea so and this is what i products products systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front now this is a technology arena so obviously these things are quite popular but i think if we 're going to keep designing buying and using and throwing out these kinds of products at the rate we currently do which is astronomically high every single year one point five billion mobile phones roll off production and some companies report their production rate as being greater than the human birth rate one hundred fifty two million phones were thrown out in the u s last year only eleven percent were recycled i 'm from australia we have a population of twenty two million don 't laugh and it 's been reported that twenty two million phones are in people 's drawers we need to find ways of solving the problems around this because these things are so complicated they have so much locked up inside them gold did you know that it 's actually cheaper now to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones than it is out of a ton of gold ore and e waste is reported or electronic waste is reported by the and because we don 't see the ramifications of the choices that we make as designers as businesspeople as consumers so we need to find smarter so imagine if when you bought your mobile phone your new one because you replaced your old one after fifteen to eighteen months is the average time that people replace their phones by the way so if we 're going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing then we should be looking at closing so you design the product to solve the problem design for disassembly design for light weighting we heard some some of those kinds of strategies being used in the tesla motors car today but understanding the system and then looking for viable consumer demand alternatives is how we can start radically altering the sustainability agenda because i hate to break it to you all consumption is the biggest problem but design is one of the best solutions these kinds of products are everywhere and i say actually start to innovate i 'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative but in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter as a criteria for fueling because as i 've just demonstrated with these simple products so we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do if you just had paper or plastic obviously reusable is far more beneficial then the paper is worse and the paper is worse because it weighs four to ten times more than the plastic and when we actually compare from a life cycle perspective a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home is not done with a kilo of each material it 's done with a very small amount of plastic and quite a lot more paper because functionality defines environmental impact and i said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco materials i say everything we design and produce in the economy or buy as consumers is done so for function we want something therefore we buy it so breaking things back down and delivering sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing everything all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life and i 'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently who i work with a senior designer i said how come you 're not doing sustainability recently i pitched a sustainability project to a client and turned and he said to me ' i know it 's going to sell more but we 're not pioneers because pioneers have arrows in their backs ' i think we 've got a roomful of pioneers and i hope there are far more pioneers out there because we need to solve these problems thank you"
