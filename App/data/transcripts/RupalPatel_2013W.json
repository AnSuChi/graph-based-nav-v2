  "transcript": "i 'd like to talk today about a powerful and fundamental aspect of who we are our voice each one of us has a unique voiceprint that reflects our age our size even our lifestyle and personality in the words of the poet longfellow the human voice is the organ of the soul i 'm fascinated by how the voice is produced and i have an idea for how it can be engineered that 's what i 'd like to share with you i 'm going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize professor stephen hawking what you may not know is that same voice may also be used by this little girl who is unable to speak because of a neurological condition and that 's because there 's only a few options available there are two point five million americans now that 's millions of people worldwide including professor hawking who uses an american accented voice this lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when i was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago and i recall walking into an exhibit hall and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices different devices but the same voice and literally hundreds of individuals a handful of voices voices that didn 't fit their bodies we wouldn 't dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man i 'm going to play you now a sample of someone who has two people actually who have severe speech listen to how they sound they 're saying the same utterance so what i wanted to do next is i wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and what he 'd been doing is building personalized voices for people by putting together these are people who had lost their voice later in life so we decided to do exactly that we set out with a little bit of funding from the national science foundation to create now before i get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it i need to give you a real quick speech science lesson okay so first we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development children sound different from teens who sound different from adults 've all experienced this fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract these are the chambers of your head and neck and actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels so the combination of source and filter is how we produce speech and that happens in one individual now i told you earlier that i 'd spent a good part of my career and what i 've found is that even though their filters were impaired and i 've been documenting for years so when i realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity i had this idea and borrow the filter we can get a voice that 's as clear as our surrogate talker that 's the person we borrowed the well you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate it 's not such an ominous thing being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances the process goes something like i love to sleep the sky is blue without clouds and the idea is not for her to say everything that the target is going to want to say but the idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language speech you have the better sounding voice you 're going to have once you have those recordings what we need to do is we have to parse these recordings into little snippets of speech one or two sound combinations sometimes even whole words that start populating a dataset or a database we 're going to call this database a voice bank we can now say any new utterance like i love chocolate everyone needs to be able to say that fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance voice i love chocolate rp so that 's speech synthesis it 's called concatenative synthesis and that 's what we 're using that 's not the novel part what 's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman i met her when she was nine and then we had to have samantha produce some utterances what she can produce are mostly vowel like sounds but that 's enough for us to extract her source characteristics what happens next is best she 's six she calls it mixing colors to paint voices it 's beautiful it 's exactly that samantha 's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate i can 't wait to use my new voice with my friends across her face when she heard that voice for the first time and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices but there 's so much more work to be done for samantha her surrogate came from somewhere in the midwest a stranger who gave her the gift of voice i 'm so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have i imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life different sizes different ages coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities to do that as a as a way to bring together those who want to join us as voice donors as expertise donors in whatever way to make this vision a reality they say that giving blood can save lives well giving your voice can change lives all we need and as little as a vowel i want to end by circling back to the human side that is really the inspiration for this work about five we built our very first voice for a little boy named william she said this is what william would have sounded like had he been able to speak and then i saw william imagine carrying around someone else 's voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice imagine that this is what william said"
