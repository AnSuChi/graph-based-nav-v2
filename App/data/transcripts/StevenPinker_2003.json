  "transcript": "and i would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that the book is called the blank slate and that all of its structure comes from socialization culture parenting experience 20th century here are a few quotes indicating that man has no nature from the historian jose ortega y gasset the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none from the late scientist stephen jay gould and some of them just come from common sense as many people have told me over the years anyone who 's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents it doesn 't all come from the outside oh and anyone who and there are also think increasing results from the scientific study of humans that indeed we 're not born blank slates one of them from anthropology is the study of human universals if you 've ever taken anthropology you know that it 's a kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other but if you instead look at what is common to the world 's cultures you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world 's 6 000 odd cultures the anthropologist donald brown has tried to list them all and they range from aesthetics genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured this is a recent study by the neurobiologist paul thompson and his colleagues in which they using mri measured the distribution of gray matter that is the the outer layer of the cortex in a large sample of pairs of people they coded correlations in the thickness of gray matter in different parts of the brain using a false color scheme in which and any color other than purple indicates a statistically this is what happens when you pair people up at random by definition two people picked at random can 't have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex this is what happens in and as you can see large amounts of the brain are not purple showing that if one person has a thicker and here 's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their dna namely clones or identical twins and you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter now these aren 't just differences in anatomy like the shape of your ear lobes but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by charles addams separated at birth the mallifert twins meet accidentally as you can see there are now the cartoon is not such an exaggeration because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities and this happens in every pair of identical twins separated at birth ever studied but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth my favorite example is a pair of twins one of whom was brought up as a catholic in a nazi family in germany the other brought up in a jewish family in trinidad when they walked into the lab in minnesota they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists and both of them liked to now but when you administer given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question why should it have been such an appealing notion well there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial the foremost is that if we 're blank slates then by another political fear of human nature is that we can perfect mankind the age old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness prejudice and violence well in the book i argue that these are in fact non sequiturs and just to make a long story short first of all the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness and so when thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal he did not mean we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are clones and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to even if we were born with certain ignoble motives they don 't automatically lead to ignoble behavior that is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts and some of them can inhibit others for example there 's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history so even if people did have impulses towards and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them in the book i and a number of other hot buttons hot zones chernobyls third rails and so on including the arts cloning crime free will education there were certain risks in taking on and here are some of the reactions that i got better get a security camera for your house job offers or positions in scholarly societies tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio there was indeed reason to to be nervous and there were moments in which i did feel nervous knowing the history of what has happened to people who 've taken controversial there are many cases some of which i talk about in the book of people who have been threatened with criminal prosecution for stumbling across or arguing about controversial findings left handers are on average more susceptible to disease more prone to accidents and have a shorter lifespan it 's not clear by the way since then whether that is an accurate pretty soon they were barraged with coming from irate were literally afraid to open their mail because of the the night is young but the book has been out for half a year and none of the dire professional consequences has taken place i exiled from the city of cambridge but what i wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the 80 odd reviews that the blank slate has received i 'll just put that list up for a few seconds and see if you can guess which reaction in it 's not gender it 's not marxism it 's not nazism they are the arts and parenting so let me tell you what aroused such irate let me start with the arts i note that among the long list of human universals that i presented a few slides ago are art there is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we visual arts decoration of surfaces and bodies appears to be a human universal the telling of stories dance poetry found in all cultures and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies a preference for symmetrical forms the use of repetition now and i have a collection probably ten or fifteen headlines from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time i 'll give you a couple of representative quotes we can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline that the standards of culture are lower than they were and a more recent one dance is dying that 's from robert brustein the famous drama critic and and director in the but by any standard there are entirely new art forms and new media many of which you 've heard over these few days by any economic standard the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing as you can tell from the of opera tickets by the number of books sold by the number of books published the number of musical titles released the number of new albums and so on the only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres one of them is in the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras where most of the repertory is before one thousand nine hundred and thirty or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums now they 're kind of a national indeed are in decline well here 's a diagnosis they didn 't ask me but by their own admission they need all the help that they can get and i would like to suggest that it 's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature a famous quotation can be found if you look on the web you can find it in literally scores of english core syllabuses in or about december one thousand nine hundred and ten human nature changed a paraphrase of a quote by virginia woolf and there 's some debate as to what she actually meant by that but it 's very clear looking at these syllabuses that it 's used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries or millennia 20th century were discarded the beauty and pleasure in art probably a human universal or commercial barnett newman had a famous quote that the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty which was considered bourgeois or tacky and here 's just one example i mean this is perhaps a representative example of here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the indeed in movements of modernism and post modernism architecture and planning without ornament human scale green space attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition laughter let me give just you an example to back up that last statement but here there one of the most famous literary and here is an example of one of her analyses the move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in and marked a shift from the form of althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects well argument in the blank slate was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century although not the arts in general have disdained beauty pleasure clarity insight and style people are staying away from elite art and criticism well this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book someone asked me whether i stuck it in in order to deflect i won 't but it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many well the other hot button is parenting and the starting point is the for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex now here is here is a representative quote from a besieged mother i 'm overwhelmed with parenting advice i 'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so i can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they 'll grow up to be large motor play small motor play i feel like i could devote my life to figuring out what to play with my kids i think anyone who 's recently been a parent can sympathize with this this mother they don 't control for heritability they measure some correlation between what the parents do how the children turn out and assume a causal relation that the parenting shaped the child parents who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be articulate parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up to be violent and so on and very few of them control for the possibility that parents pass on genes for increase the chances a child will be articulate or violent and so on the genetically controlled studies have some sobering results remember the mallifert twins separated at birth then they meet in the patent office remarkably similar wrong identical twins or any siblings who are separated at birth everything that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect a complementary finding from a completely different methodology is that adopted siblings reared together the mirror image of identical twins reared apart they share their parents their home their neighborhood don 't share their genes end up not similar at all ok two different bodies of research with a similar but in part only in part by their genes in part by their culture the culture of the country at large and the children 's own culture namely their peer group as we heard from jill sobule earlier today that 's what kids care about chance events as you live your life"
