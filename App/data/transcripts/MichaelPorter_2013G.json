  "transcript": "all aware that the world today is full of problems we 've been hearing them serious problems climate change deforestation not enough food not enough healthcare pollution there 's problem after problem and i think what really separates this time from any time i can remember in in my brief time on earth is the awareness of these problems we 're all very aware why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems that 's the question i 've been struggling with coming from my very different so why are we having so and really is there any role for business and if so what is that role i think that in order to address that question we have to step back and think about how we 've understood and pondered both the problems and the solutions to these great social challenges that we face now i think many have seen business as the problem or at least one of the problems in many of the social challenges we face you know think of the fast food industry the drug industry the banking industry you know this is a low point in the respect for business and rightly so in many cases there 's a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing that actually have made the problem worse so this perspective is perhaps justified well we 've tended to see the solutions in terms of ngos in terms of government in terms of philanthropy indeed the kind of unique organizational entity of this age is this tremendous rise of ngos and enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these and many of us here are deeply involved in that i 'm a business school professor but i 've actually founded form a nonprofit that was the way we 've thought about how to deal with these issues even a business school professor has thought about it that way we have decades of experience we 're not winning problems still seem very daunting and very intractable and any solutions we 're achieving are small solutions we 're making incremental progress if we cut all the complexity away we have the problem we can make progress we can show benefits we can show results we can make things better we can 't make a large scale impact why is that because we don 't have the resources there 's simply not enough money to deal with any of these problems at scale there 's not enough philanthropic donations to deal with these problems the way we 're dealing with them now we 've got to and the scarcity of resources certainly in the advanced world today with all the fiscal problems we face if it 's fundamentally a resource problem well there i think the answer is very clear they 're in business all wealth is actually created by business business creates wealth when it meets needs it 's meeting needs at a profit that 's where all the resources come but only business can create them and business creates them when it 's able to meet a need at a profit the resources are overwhelmingly generated by business the question then is how do we tap into this how do we tap into this business generates those resources when it makes a profit that profit is that small difference between but that profit why because that profit allows whatever solution we 've created to be infinitely scalable one hundred million self sustaining that 's what business does when it makes a profit well one line of thinking is let 's take this profit and redeploy it but again this path that we 've been on is not getting us where we need to go i started out as a strategy professor and i 'm still a strategy i started seeing something that had a profound impact on me and my whole life and the view in business has historically been that actually there 's a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance the conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit by causing a social problem the classic example is pollution reducing pollution is expensive therefore businesses don 't want to do it therefore business makes more money if they don 't have a safe working environment that 's been the conventional wisdom a lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom they resisted environmental improvement they resisted workplace improvement that thinking one after another and actually the more i tried to address them myself personally in a few cases through nonprofits that i was involved with the more i found actually that the reality is the opposite business does not profit from causing social problems actually not in any fundamental sense the deeper we get into these issues the more we start to understand that actually business profits from solving from social problems that 's where the real profit comes let we 've learned today that actually reducing pollution and emissions is generating profit it saves business more productive and efficient it doesn 't waste resources having a safer working environment actually and avoiding accidents accidents are expensive and costly issue by issue by issue we start to learn that actually there 's no trade off between social progress and economic efficiency in any what we 've found is actually health of employees is something that business should treasure because the deeper work the new work the new thinking on the interface between social problems is actually showing that there 's a fundamental deep particularly if you 're not thinking in the very short run in the very short run you can sometimes fool yourself into thinking that there 's fundamentally opposing goals but in the long run ultimately we 're learning in field after field that this is simply not true so how could we tap into the power of business we could tap into this enormous resource pool and this organizational capacity partly because of people like you who have raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade we see organizations like dow chemical leading the revolution away from trans fat and saturated fat with innovative new products we see companies like the brazilian forestry company fibria that 's figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare you see companies like cisco that are training so far four million people in i t skills there 's a fundamental opportunity for business today and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business and the question is how can we get business thinking to adapt this issue of shared value that 's shared value but it 's a higher kind of capitalism it 's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be meeting important needs not incrementally competing for trivial differences in it 's finding those opportunities it 's real it 's happening but in order to get this solution working we have to now change how business sees itself and this is thankfully underway we 're now seeing companies embrace this but we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have ngos and government working in partnership with the new ngos that are really moving the needle are the ones that have found these partnerships that have found these ways to collaborate the governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the shots and government has many ways in which it could impact we can change the world i 'm seeing it i 'm i 'm feeling it young people i think my harvard business school students are getting it if we can break down this sort of divide this unease this tension this sense that we 're not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems we can break this down and we finally i think can have solutions thank you"
