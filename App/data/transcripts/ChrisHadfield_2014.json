  "transcript": "and why did you do it i know what the most dangerous thing is that i 've ever done because nasa does the math you look back to the first five shuttle launches the odds the odds were still now that we look back about one in so it 's a really interesting day when you wake up at the kennedy space center and you 're going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you 're either going to be floating effortlessly gloriously in space or you 'll be dead you go into at the kennedy space center heroes got dressed in that neil armstrong and buzz aldrin got suited in to go ride the apollo rocket to the moon and i got my pressure suit built around me and it 's normally predawn lit up by the the huge xenon lights is your spaceship the crew is is sitting in the astro van sort of hushed almost holding hands looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger we ride the elevator up and we crawl in on your hands and knees into the spaceship one at a time and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back and and suddenly what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real something that i dreamed in the astronaut business the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle it 's the most complicated flying machine ever built and in the astronaut business we have a saying which is there is no problem so bad that you can 't make it worse and so you 're very conscious in the cockpit you 're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through and as the time gets closer and closer this excitement like this happens it is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things you are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself it 's shaking you so hard you can 't focus on the instruments in front of you it 's like you 're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there 's a foot in the small of your back and you 're in a after two minutes those solid rockets and it 's as if you 're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you 've never accelerated you get lighter and lighter the force gets on us heavier and heavier it feels after about eight minutes and forty seconds or so the engine shut off and we 're alive it 's an amazing experience but why would we take that risk why would you do something that dangerous in my case the answer is fairly straightforward was inspired as a as a youngster that this was what i wanted to do i watched the first people walk on the moon and to me it was just an obvious thing i want to somehow turn myself into that how do you deal with fear versus danger and having the goal in mind thinking about where it might lead directed me to a life of of looking at all of the the small details to allow this to become possible to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million pound creation that 's going around the world at five miles a second eight kilometers a second around the world sixteen times a day with experiments on board that are teaching us allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means to be able to look down and have if your jaw could drop it would the and you see because of the speed a sunrise or a sunset every forty five minutes for half a year and the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk you are in a spaceship that is your spacesuit and you 're going space with the world looking at the world turn beside you it 's roaring silently with with color and texture as it pours by if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything it 's unfathomable blackness with a into and you are holding on with one hand one link to the other seven billion people and i was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went and i didn 't know why suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and and i couldn 't figure out why why my eye wasn 't working i but unfortunately without gravity so you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge and now i was completely blind outside so what 's the scariest thing you 've ever done maybe it 's spiders a lot of people are afraid of spiders i think you should be afraid of spiders spiders are creepy and they 've got long hairy legs necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the and how do you know and so a spider lands on you and you go through this great spasmy attack because spiders are scary but then you could say well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not i don 't know are there brown recluses here so if you actually you find out that in the world there are about fifty thousand different types of spiders and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of fifty thousand and if you 're in canada because of the cold winters here in b c there 's about seven hundred and twenty seven hundred and thirty different types of spiders and there 's one one that is venomous and its venom isn 't even it 's just kind of like a nasty sting and that spider not only that but that spider has beautiful markings on it it 's like i 'm dangerous i got a big radiation symbol on my back you 're walking along you are never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you spider webs like this it doesn 't build those it builds them down in the corners and its a black widow because the female spider eats the male the next time you walk into a spiderweb you don 't need to panic and go with your caveman reaction the danger is entirely different than the fear well next time you see a spiderweb have a good look make sure it 's not a black widow spider and then walk into it and then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one just a little bit of fluffy stuff it 's not a big deal and the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug or or a and then i guarantee you if you walk through one hundred spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior your caveman reaction and you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb or or into your grandma 's attic or whatever into and you can apply this to anything if you 're outside on a spacewalk and you 're blinded and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs we knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs and not just and even if you 're blinded your natural i can talk scott parazynski is out here with me he could come over and help me we actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to i could find we finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside jeff got some and now we use 's no more tears which we probably should 've been using right from the very beginning laughter but the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger where is the real risk what is the real thing that you should be afraid of not just a generic fear of bad things where you could see the the hardpan south of the sahara or you can see new york city or the unconscious gingham of eastern europe fields or the great lakes as a collection of small small puddles you can see the fault lines of san francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear you see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened so that it allows you to"
