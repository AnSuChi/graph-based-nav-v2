  "transcript": "if you ask people about what what part of psychology do they think is hard and you say well what about thinking and emotions most people will say emotions are terribly hard they 're incredibly complex they can 't i have no idea of how they work but that 's not the hard part so here 's a list of problems that come up one nice problem is what do we do about health the other day i was reading something and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the west and there was a little study about people who don 't handshake and because they must be hiding and the people who avoid that have thirty percent less infectious disease or something or maybe it was thirty one and a quarter percent i 've had to and i think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease and the single best way is and then of course you have to do something about how to moderate that so that anybody can poverty how do we make 're lots of problems to worry about anyway the question i think people should talk about and it 's absolutely taboo is how many people should there be and i think it should be about one hundred million or and then notice that a great many of these problems disappear if you had one hundred million people properly spread out preferably where you can 't see it and it will rot or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it and there 's these cube by using nanotechnology i suppose and there 's one solution that 's probably only a sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out but so you can skip the grandparent and great grandparent stage and go right to the and you have forty six people and you give them a scanner or whatever you need and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best or she and i suppose you could let each group of forty six parents have fifteen children wouldn and then the children would get plenty of support and nurturing and mentoring and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy and there 's this great novel that arthur clarke wrote twice called against the fall of night and the city and the stars they 're both wonderful and largely the same except that computers happened in between and arthur was looking at this old book and he said well that was wrong the future must have some computers so in the second version of it but and you let a few million of them out at a time a person comes out they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do and then when it 's time to go back for a billion years or a million i forget the numbers don 't matter and you get to think about yourself and your memories and before you go back into suspension you edit the plot of the book is that there 's not enough diversity and in the novel a particular one named alvin is created and he says maybe this isn 't the best way and wrecks the whole system i think the big problem is that we 're not smart enough therefore we have to build super intelligent machines like hal as you remember at some point in the book for two thousand and one hal realizes that the universe is too big and grand and profound for those really stupid astronauts if you contrast hal 's behavior with the triviality but we 're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face either in abstract mathematics or in figuring out economies or balancing the world around and nobody knows how hard that is but we 'll probably find out in a few years you see there 's two forks in the road we know that and nobody lives more than one hundred and twenty years but lots of people now live to ninety or one hundred unless they shake hands too much or something like that and so maybe if we lived two hundred years we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to and as i said we don 't know how hard that is it might be after all most other mammals live half as and in the case of the primates we have almost the same genes we only differ from chimpanzees in the present state of knowledge which is absolute hogwash what i think is that the gene counters don 't know what they 're doing yet whatever you do don 't read anything about genetics that 's published within your lifetime or something and we can live two hundred and i doubt that it 's several hundred so this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists you know an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind and because what about the consequences and of course we 're not responsible for the consequences of what we 're doing now are we like all this complaint about clones and yet two random people will mate and have this child and both of them have some pretty rotten genes and the child is likely to come out to be average which by chimpanzee standards is very good indeed then we can 't let them have and so there won 't be any workforce and one of the things laurie garrett pointed out and others have is that that doesn 't have people of working age is in real trouble and things are going to get worse because there 's nobody to educate the children or to and when i 'm talking about a long lifetime of course i don 't want somebody who 's two hundred years old to be like our image of what you know there 's about four hundred different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions nobody knows how most of them work in detail but we do know that and so if you think of yourself as as a sort of city with a hundred resources then when you 're afraid for example you may discard your long range goals but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal you throw everything else away you become a monomaniac all you care about is not stepping out on that platform so i see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability emotion is not something added to thought an emotional state is what you get when you remove so thinking of emotions as the opposite of as something less than thinking is immensely productive and i hope in the next few years to show that this will lead to smart machines and i guess i better skip all the and therefore there 's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that types of obstacles so you see it 's almost like a pavlovian we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories where you say how do people learn how to react to including designing a huge messy system with thousands of ports we 'll end up again with the central problem of psychology not what are the situations but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies how do you learn them how do you connect them up how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and and so forth so rule based systems and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem some problems are good for neural nets we know that others neural nets are hopeless on them and i won 't tell you"
