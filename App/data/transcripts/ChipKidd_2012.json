  "transcript": "i did that for two reasons but the main reason i did it is that that 's what happens to me when i 'm forced to wear a lady gaga skanky mic i 'm used to a stationary mic it 's the sensible shoe of public address but you clamp this thing on my head and something happens i just become skanky and i 'm already ladies and gentlemen it all sort of started as a benign mistake like penicillin but upon arrival there and i was incredibly lucky soon it had occurred to me what my job was my job was to ask this question what do the stories look like because that is what knopf is it is the story factory one of the very best in the world we bring stories to the public the stories can be anything but they all have one thing in common they all need to look like something why to give you a first impression of what you are about to get into but also manages a very careful balance between the two now listen up and he covered up the picture and he said you either say this but you don 't do this because this is treating your audience like a moron and they deserve better and lo and behold soon enough i was able to put this theory to the test on two books that i was working and the second was a biography of marlene dietrich now the hepburn book was written in a very conversational style it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you and so we did this so there you are pure content and pure form side by side no fighting i live and work in new york city where there are plenty of dinosaurs and i checked out the and i bought a book and i was particularly taken with this page of the book now and i put it in a photostat machine and i taped it over the photostat with a piece of scotch tape stop me if i 'm going too fast and then i took a rapidograph pen explain it to the youngsters and i just started to i had no idea where i was going but at some point i stopped when to keep going would seem like i was going too far and what i ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being we 're in the middle of the process and then i just threw some typography on it very basic stuff slightly suggestive of public park signage and even back that was a relief to see that pour out of the machine i miss michael and sure enough somebody from mca universal calls our legal department well they used it and i was thrilled we all know it was an amazing movie and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon but not too long ago i came upon this on the web but whoever it is i can 't help but thinking they woke up one day like oh my god that wasn 't there last night from my head to my hands to his leg that 's a responsibility and it 's a responsibility that i don 't take lightly the book designer 's responsibility is threefold to the reader to the publisher i need to read that david sedaris is one of my favorite writers and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony and the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image he wanted to explore what was underlying that for me it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of but when you do you don 't get what you expect you get something that goes much deeper than that and david especially loved this design because at book signings which he does a lot of he could take a magic marker and it 's about his time in rehab in his 20s he was a hotshot ad executive and as mad men has told us a raging alcoholic he did not think so however but his coworkers or this was always going to be a typographic solution what i would call the opposite of type one hundred and one what does that mean usually on the first day of introduction to typography you get the assignment of select a word and make it look like what it says it is so that 's type one hundred and one right very simple stuff this is going to be the opposite of that i want this book to look like it 's lying to you desperately and hopelessly the way an alcoholic would the answer was the most low tech thing you can imagine i set up the type i printed it out on an epson printer with water soluble ink taped it to the wall and presto then when we went to press the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running and she said to the man behind the counter guy behind the counter said i know lady they all came in that way now that 's a good printing job a book cover is a distillation it is a haiku if you will of the story this particular story by osama tezuka and it 's eight volumes in all but the best thing is when it 's on your shelf you get a shelf life moving from one age to the next all of these solutions but once the book designer has read the text then he has to be an interpreter and a translator this story was a real puzzle this is what it 's about all right so i got a collection of the paintings together and i looked at them and i deconstructed them and i put them back together and so here 's the design right and so here 's the front but the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf they 've been discovered by the sultan he will not be pleased try experiencing that on a kindle get me started seriously the comfort of a little bit of humanity do you know what john updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from alfred a knopf he 'd smell it and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages now i am all for the ipad but trust me smelling it will get you nowhere now the apple guys are texting develop odor emission plug in laughter and the last story i 'm going to talk about is quite japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway when she gets to the bottom she can 't help but feel that all of a sudden she 's entered a new but different and so but now we merge them so this is on a which is the opposite and the object itself invited exploration interaction consideration and touch this debuted at number two on the new york times best seller list this is unheard of both for us the publisher we 're talking a 900 page book that is as weird as it is compelling and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a german shepherd to explode not exactly jackie collins eight printings and still going strong so even though we love publishing as an art so that 's my story to be continued what does it look like it can it does and it will but for this book designer"
