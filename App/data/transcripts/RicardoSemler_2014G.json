  "transcript": "i call them my terminal days my wife fernanda doesn 't like the term but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it and i kept thinking one day i could be sitting in front of a doctor who looks at my exams and says ricardo things don 't look very good you have six months or a year to live and you start thinking about what you would do with this time and you say i 'm going to spend more time with the kids i 'm going to visit these places i 'm going to go up and down mountains and places and i 'm going to do all the things i didn 't do when i had the time but of course we all know these are very bittersweet whatever it is i was going to do think about the opposite of work we many times think it 's leisure and you say ah i need some leisure time and so forth but the fact is that leisure is a very busy thing you go play golf and tennis and you meet people and you 're going for lunch and you 're late for the it 's a very crowded thing that we do the opposite of work you realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money we have very little time so we started thinking about that as a company for the last thirty years this is a complicated company with thousands of employees hundreds of millions of dollars of business that makes runs four thousand atms in brazil does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands so this is not a simple business we looked at it and we let 's devolve to these people let 's give these people the retirement the whole issue of how we distribute our graph so now if you were going to be a violinist which you probably weren 't you go and do this on wednesday and what we found we thought and so why are we building these headquarters is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid and big and important but we 're dragging you two hours across town because of it so we started asking questions one by one we how do we find people we 'd go out and try and recruit people and we 'd say look when you come to us we 're not going to have two or three interviews and then you 're going to be married to us for life that 's not how we do the rest of our lives so come have your interviews anyone who 's interested in interviewing you will show up and then we 'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that instead of just filling out the little items of whether you 're the right person and then come back spend an afternoon spend a whole day talk to anybody you want make sure we are the bride you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads we don 't want anyone to be a leader in the company if they haven 't been interviewed and approved by their future subordinates everyone gets evaluated anonymously as a leader and so if they don 't have seventy eighty percent of a grade they don 't stay and we started asking other questions we said things like why what do they need to know how much people make somewhere else in a similar business so we started having in the cafeteria and this is twenty five years ago we don 't want to know how many holidays go to the one that 's closest to your house to the customer that you 're going to visit today don 't tell us where you are and thankfully one of them has retired the question we were asking was the main thing i was looking for in the terminal days and in the company which is we 've come from an age please go to the beach don 't create a problem for us for manufacturing for application then we have to buy new companies we have to buy our competitors we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets so go to the beach and start again on monday applause so the process is looking for wisdom in the process of course we wanted people to know everything and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things so our board had two seats open with the same voting rights for the first two people who showed up and so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board this process where am i supposed to sit how am i supposed to work where am i going to be in five years ' time so we set up a foundation which now has for eleven three schools where we started asking the same questions how do you redesign school for wisdom it but the fact is that the teacher 's role is entirely obsolete going from a math class to biology to and we put together people including people who like education people like and two ministers of education in brazil and we said if we were to design a school from scratch what would it look like and so we created this school which is called lumiar and one of them is a public school and lumiar says the following let 's divide this role of the teacher into two one guy we 'll call a tutor a tutor in the old sense of the greek the kid but please don 't teach because the little you know compared to google we don 't want to know keep that to yourself and it could be their profession or not so we bring them to school teach these kids whatever you really believe in so we have violinists teaching math we how do we measure ourselves so there 's a place for music and literature etc but also for grammar the very so that 's a big part of what we do and we 'd say you put the rules together and then you decide what you want to do with it so can you all hit yourself on the head sure for a week try and then they have which means they can and do suspend and expel kids so that not playing school they really decide and then in this same because this is not constructivist or montessori or something it 's something where we keep the brazilian curriculum with six hundred tiles of a mosaic which we want to expose these kids to by the time they 're seventeen and the kids are in groups that don 't have an age category so the six year old kid who is ready for that with an 11 year old that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have in the schools and they have a zero to one hundred percent grading which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours until we know thirty seven percent of the way we 'd like them to be on this issue so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it and so the the courses are world cup soccer or building a bicycle and people will sign up for a building a bicycle now try to build a bicycle without knowing that pi is three point so this is lost and that 's what we try to do there which is i accumulated a lot of money when i think about now is the time to give back well if you 're giving back you took too much i keep thinking of warren buffet waking up one day and finding out he has thirty billion dollars more than he thought he had and he looks this and he says i 'll give it to someone who really needs this i 'll give it to bill gates and look you 're a silly guy because you would have four point one times more money today if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go i taught and the first time around i saw these tombstones and these wonderful people who 'd done great things and i thought what do i want to be remembered for and i did another stroll around and the second time another question came to me which did did me better which was why do i want to be remembered at all and that i think took me different places we had a big pit this hundreds and hundreds of articles and dvds everything there was and that did two things one it freed our five kids from following in our steps our shadow they don 't know what i do which is good and which is good i 'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days and some people would say oh so now you have this time these terminal days and so you go out and do everything no we 've been to the beaches so we 've been to samoa and maldives and mozambique so that 's i 've spent fifty nine days on the back of a camel from chad to timbuktu i 've gone to the magnetic north pole on a dog sled so we 've been busy i don 't feel retired at all and so i 'm writing a new book we started three new companies in the last i 'm now working on getting this school system and so i 've been trying for ten years to get the public system to take over this school rationale much as the public schools we have which has instead of forty three out of one hundred and i think what this leaves us as a message for all of you i think is a little bit like this we 've all learned how to go on sunday night to because the first why you always have a good answer for the second why it starts getting difficult by the third why you don 't really know why you 're doing what you 're doing what i want to leave you with is the seed and the thought as a result of that and over time i hope that with this and that 's what i 'm wishing you you 'll have a and yet so your ideas are so radical how in business for example these ideas have been out for a while probably the percentage of businesses that have taken some of them is still quite low are there any times you 've seen some big company take on one of your ideas and you 've gone or netflix does a little bit of this and that but but the fact is that it takes a leap of faith about losing control and almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith it will have to come from kids and other people who are starting companies in a different way ca so that 's the key thing from your point of view the evidence is there in the business point of view this works but people just don 't have the courage to rs they don 't even have the incentive it 's a quarterly report if you 're not good in ninety days you 're out so you say here 's a great program that in less than one generation and the guy says get out of here is the problem what you 're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound everyone so you 've got actual evidence now that the kids so far going through your system there 's a dramatic increase how do we help you move these ideas forward suddenly you find people there 's a group in japan which scares me very much which is called the they 've invited me i 've always been scared to go dutch companies and it doesn 't matter this will find its own place and i 'm afraid of the other one which says this is so good you 've got to do this let 's set up a system and put lots of money into it and then people will you have asked extraordinary questions your whole life it seems to me that 's the fuel that 's driven a lot of this do you have any other questions for for us for ted for this group here rs i always come back to variations of the question that my my son asked me when he was three we were sitting in a jacuzzi and he said dad why do so when you spend time in a company in a bureaucracy in an organization and you 're saying boy how many people do you know who on their death beds said boy i wish i had spent more time at the office so there 's a whole thing of having the courage not in a week not in two months not when you find out you have something to say let me do something else and it will be okay it will be much better than what you 're doing if you 're stuck in a process ca so that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end this penultimate day of ted ricardo semler"
