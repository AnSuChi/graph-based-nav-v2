  "transcript": "that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing and when we have overwhelming problems and i think this is what we 've done with climate change i would put to you that it 's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem we 're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it and the reason why is that we live on a planet that rapidly urbanizing that shouldn 't be news to any of us however it 's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization in order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy it may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy so if we 're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet we need to look somewhere else for the solution the solution in fact may be closer to hand than we think because all of those cities we 're building every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants we tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing i choose to turn this light switch on but really enormous amounts of our energy use are are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in i won 't show you very many graphs today but if i can just focus on this one for a moment it really tells us a lot of what we need to know which is quite simply that if you look for example at transportation a major category of climate emissions there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air and the correlation of course is that denser places tend to have lower emissions which isn 't really all that difficult to figure out if you think about it basically we substitute and we 're basically using mobility to get the access we need but when we live in a denser suddenly what we find of course is that the things we need are close by and since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable and it is possible of course to increase the density of the communities around us some places are doing this with new eco districts developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods which is nice work if you can get it reweaving the urban fabric that we already have so we 're talking about things like development really sharp little changes to where we have buildings where we 're developing urban retrofitting creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there increasingly we 're realizing that we don 't even need to densify an entire city what we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don 't drive as much and so on and that can be done by and we find that when we do that we can in fact have a few places that are really hyper dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results now we may find that there are places that are really really dense and still hold onto their cars but the reality is that by and large what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect where people simply stop driving as much and increasingly more and more people if they 're surrounded by places that make them feel at home give up their cars altogether and this is a huge huge energy savings because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just and when you layer that over with the even more access suffused into spaces some of it 's transportation access this is a mapnificent map that shows me in this case how far i can get from my home in thirty minutes using public transportation and it told me to go via guernsey it did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths though but the technologies are getting better and we 're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation and as we just heard earlier of course we 're also learning how to put information on dumb objects things that don 't have any wiring in them at all we 're learning how to include in these systems of notation part of what we 're finding with this is that what we thought was the major point of manufacturing and consumption how we really live best in dense environments what we 're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things i do too the average home power drill is used somewhere between six and twenty minutes in its entire lifetime depending on who you ask and so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit our cities i would put to you are stockpiles of these surplus capacities and while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them is a far smarter way to go and in fact even space itself is turning into a service we 're finding that people can share the same spaces do stuff with vacant space buildings are becoming bundles of services so we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on like heating cooling things that we avoid spending energy on so we light our buildings with daylight we cool them with breezes we heat them with sunshine in fact when we use all these things what we 've found is that than the alternatives now when we look at being able to slash our our product use slash our transportation use slash and if we 're going to really truly become sustainable cities we need to think a little differently this is one way to do it this is vancouver 's propaganda about how green a city they are and certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that sustainable city is covered in greenery so we have visions like this we have visions like this we have visions like this now all of these are fine projects but they really have do they for instance capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use energy intensive do they perhaps include green infrastructure so that we can take runoff and water that 's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by for example connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities and that it 's a darn good thing because right now our economy by and large operates as paul hawken selling it in the present and calling it gdp but have unlimited possibilities as well thank you very much"
