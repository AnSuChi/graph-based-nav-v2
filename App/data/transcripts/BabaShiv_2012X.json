  "transcript": "my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer stage iib now looking back the most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits these were very painful for my wife understandably so the most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us should it be a mastectomy should it be a lumpectomy and these were being thrust upon us by the doctors now you could ask this question why were the doctors doing this a simplistic answer would be the doctors are doing this because i think that is too simplistic these are well meaning doctors some of them have gone on to become very good friends it 's best to be in control it 's best to be in the driver 's seat and we were certainly in the driver 's seat making all these let me tell you if some of you have been there it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience which got me thinking i said is there any validity to this this whole adage that when you or are there contexts where we 're far better off taking the passenger 's seat and have someone else drive for example a trusted financial advisor and since so i want to tell you that what you 're going to do in the study is if you 're wondering why i 'll tell you why in a few seconds from now you are going to solve a series of puzzles and i 'm going to show you examples of these puzzles why because it makes a lot of sense in order to solve these puzzles effectively it needs to be alert for which caffeine is very good simultaneously it needs to be calm not agitated calm for which chamomile is very good now comes the so everyone here will be group a everyone out here will be group folks what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to show you these two teas and i 'll go ahead and ask you to choose your tea so you can choose whichever tea you want you can decide what is your mental state ok you 're going to be in the driver 's seat i 'm going to give you one of these two teas and keep in mind i 'm going to pick one of these two teas at random for you so if you think about it this is an extreme case scenario because in the real world anyone in the audience want to take a stab gave the answer as a participant we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise because we want these puzzles to be difficult these are tricky puzzles because your first instinct is to say tulip so these have been calibrated so you have thirty minutes now to solve these fifteen puzzles now the question we 're asking here is in terms of the outcome the number of puzzles solved will you in the driver 's seat you could decide which tea you would choose or would you be better off in terms of the number of puzzles solved and across a series of studies is that you the passengers even though the tea was picked for you at random will end up solving more puzzles than you the drivers we also observe observe and that is you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles you 're also putting less juice into the task and so on how do we know that well we have two objective measures one is what is the time on average you 're taking in attempting to solve these puzzles you will spend less time compared to you second you have thirty minutes to solve these are you taking the entire thirty you will be more likely to give up before the thirty minutes elapse compared to you so you 're putting in less juice and therefore the outcome fewer puzzles solved that brings us now to why does this happen and under what situations when would we see this pattern of results where the passenger is going to show better more favorable outcomes compared to the driver it all has to do with when you face what i call the inca it so if you think about it in this particular puzzle task it could happen in investing in the stock market very volatile out there it could be the medical situation the feedback here is immediate whether you 're solving the puzzles or not the deck was stacked against you in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles for example very early on in the treatment things are negative the feedback before things become positive right it can happen in the stock now the added one apart from this immediacy negative so what do you do you know what i should have chosen the other tea that casts your decision in doubt the confidence you have in the performance the and this can happen in the medical domain if you think about it right a patient in driver 's seat for example less juice which means and therefore there are times when you 're facing the inca when the feedback is going to be concrete and you have the sense of agency where you 're far better off thank god is that so but one thing i didn 't mention was was my wife and i decided that we would take the passenger 's seat and"
