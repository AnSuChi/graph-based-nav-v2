  "transcript": "i 'm a filmmaker for the last eight years i have dedicated my life to documenting the work of israelis and palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful when i travel with my work across europe and the united states one question always comes up why aren 't palestinians using nonviolent resistance the challenge i face when i hear this question is that often i have just returned from the middle east where i spent my time filming dozens of palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from israeli soldiers and settlers these leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region yet most of you have probably never heard about them this divide between what 's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad so i 'm here today to talk about the power of attention the power of your attention gaza and elsewhere but today case study is going to be palestine i believe that what 's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence but for us to start paying attention to those who already are allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called budrus because israel announced it would build a separation barrier and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village through inspired local they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening let me show you some brief clips so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground created a solution to terror when i first heard about the story of budrus i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago in two thousand and three what was even more surprising was the fact that budrus was successful the residents which is the internationally yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories this silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow or even survive in palestine violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause if violent actors are the only ones constantly getting and attracting international attention to the palestinian issue it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums the tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it but that 's true for adults too in fact the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today in the course of taking my film i have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation the community was facing a very similar plight to budrus they were going to be surrounded lose a lot of their lands they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention so we organized a screening a week later the organizers say that the villagers upon seeing the story of budrus documented in a film felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing so they kept on going the leaders of this movement have been using budrus and the solidariot movement show that even a now imagine the power that big media players could have in jerusalem neighborhoods like sheikh jarrah and silwan the nonviolent leaders valued and effective in their work i believe that the most important thing is is to understand that if we don 't pay attention they are invisible and it 's as if they never happened but i have seen first hand that if we do they will multiply if they multiply their influence will grow in the overall conflict and theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation let 's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere"
