  "transcript": "called the human immune system you 're pitching this product to a i think we all know at least one bob right how would that go i can see from your face that you 're having some problems with this don 't worry i know it 's very complicated i don 't want to take you through the i just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product first of all it cleverly uses redundancy by having millions of copies of each component leukocytes white blood cells natural killer cells the components don 't really matter the point is that together this diversity of different approaches can cope with more or less anything that evolution has been able to throw up and the design is completely modular you have the surface barrier of the human skin you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted i can see i 'm losing you bob but stay with me because here it 's able to actually develop targeted antibodies to threats that it 's never even met before in case the product is embedded embedded in the larger system of the human body and it works in complete harmony with that system to create this unprecedented level of biological protection so bob just tell me honestly what do you think of my product and i sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone into your presentation blah blah blah didn 't they teach you 80 20 it overreacts makes things up as it goes along and is actually designed for somebody else 's benefit i 'm sorry to break it to you but i don 't think this one is a winner i think we 'd actually end up with a more efficient immune system and efficiency is always important in the short term who could say no to that unfortunately there 's one very tiny problem and that is that the user of this product you or i would probably die within i first became interested when i was asked a very unusual question by the ceo of a global tech company and the question what do we have to do to make sure that our company lasts one hundred years a seemingly innocent question but actually it 's a little trickier than you might think considering that the average us public company now can expect a life span of only thirty years that is less than half of the life span that its employees can expect to enjoy now the probability that your company will not be around in five year 's time on average is now a staggering thirty two percent that 's a one in three chance let 's come back to our tech ceo 's question where better to turn for advice than nature that 's been in the business of life and death for longer than any company professor of biology and mathematics at princeton university and we asked ourselves the question what makes these systems resilient and enduring and what we found from redundancy we also found them being very characteristic of like the roman empire and the catholic church believe it or not we also went on to look at business and found that these very same properties also characterized businesses that were resilient and long lived and we noted their absence from ones which were short lived let 's first take a look at what happens when the corporate immune system collapses it 's one of the oldest temples in japan japan was not yet building temples and this korean artisan went on to found a in fact it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world so how is kong gumi doing today it borrowed very heavily during the bubble period of the japanese economy to invest in real estate and when the bubble burst and it was taken over tragically after forty generations of very careful stewardship by the kong family kong gumi succumbed to a spectacular lapse in the ability to apply a principle of prudence speaking of company failures we 're all familiar the company that declared bankruptcy in january two thousand and twelve much more interesting however is the question why did fujifilm same fujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry material science and optics ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals to medical systems to biomaterials some of these diversification attempts failed it was able to adapt its portfolio sufficiently fujifilm survived because it applied the principles of prudence diversity and adaptation the only plant the ultimate test of resilience car production ground to a screeching halt how was it then that toyota was able to recover car production how was this possible toyota managed its network of suppliers in such a collaborative manner fill the missing braking valve capacity and have car production come online again toyota applied the principles of modularity of its supply network embeddedness in an integrated system and the functional redundancy to be able to repurpose smoothly existing capacity but we do read in the newspaper every day about companies succumbing how is it then that the consumer optics giant essilor is able to avoid technology disruption and even profit from it essilor carefully scans the competitive environment for potentially disruptive technologies it acquires those technologies very early before they 've become expensive or competitors have mobilized and it then develops those technologies itself even at the risk of failure or the risk of self disruption essilor stays ahead of its game and has delivered spectacular performance for over forty years by using the principles of prudence ok if these principles are so powerful you might be thinking why are they not commonplace in business why do we not use these words every day well change has to first start in the mind if we think back to our pitch to bob we use what i call mechanical thinking we analyze problems we construct we stress efficiency and short term performance now don 't get me wrong this is a splendidly practical and effective way of addressing relatively simple challenges in relatively stable environments it 's the way that bob and probably many of us myself included process most it was a pretty good mental model for business overall until about the when the conjunction of globalization and a revolution in technology and telecommunications made business far more dynamic and unpredictable i think in addition to the mechanical thinking we now need to master the art of biological thinking as embodied by our six principles we need to think more modestly and subtly about when and how we can shape rather than control it 's a little like the difference between throwing a ball and releasing a bird the ball would head in a straight line probably towards the intended target and the bird certainly would not so what do you think sounds a little impractical a little theoretical perhaps not at all every small entrepreneurial company naturally thinks and acts biologically why because it lacks the resources to shape its environment through brute force it lacks the scale to buffer change and it 's constantly thinking about the tough odds for a start up to survive but along the way somewhere many have lost this ability to think and act biologically they need to rejuvenate their ability to think biologically in order to survive and thrive in today 's environment so let 's not just think about short term performance every company i know spends plenty of time thinking about the central question of strategy how good is our competitive game thank you very much"
