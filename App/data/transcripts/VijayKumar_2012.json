  "transcript": "good morning i 'm here today to talk about autonomous flying beach balls no agile aerial robots like this one i 'd like to tell you a little bit about the so these robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles they 're not even autonomous many of these vehicles are operated by flight crews operators of sensors and mission coordinators and so we retrofit these with sensors and processors the robot i 'm holding in my hand is this one so let me give you just a very quick if you increase the speed of each of these rotors inclined to the horizontal then it would accelerate in this to get it to tilt there 's one of two ways of doing it so in this picture you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower and when that happens if you spin opposite pairs of rotors so one of the advantages of this design is when you scale things down the robot naturally becomes agile and there are lots of physical parameters that change as you reduce r which governs angular so this should be clear in these videos on the bottom right you see a robot performing a and it shows you how robust the control is no matter how you throw it the robot recovers and comes back to him so why build robots like this well robots like this have many applications you can send them inside buildings like this as first responders you can also use them for applications like so one of the problems with these small robots so you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads shortly after the earthquake so robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings to assess the damage after natural disasters or sent into reactor buildings to map radiation levels b so this gets a little challenging because the dynamics of this robot are quite and so what the robot does is it plans what we call so these minimum snap trajectories in this flat space are then transformed back into this complicated and in the first video you 'll see the robot going from point a to point b through an intermediate point the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory so these are circular trajectories where the robot pulls about two g 's here you have overhead while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop and we get our robots to do that so another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it and then does this pirouette this two and a half so one difficulty and so here we looked to nature so i want to show you a clip of carrying an object so this is actually a piece of fig actually you take any object coated with fig juice and the ants will carry it back to the nest so these ants don 't have any central coordinator but because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object so this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have so when we have a robot which is surrounded by neighbors and let 's look at robot i and robot j what we want the robots to do is to monitor the separation between them as they fly so again the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands one so this also has to be done in a decentralized way their actions only on local information what they sense from their neighbors so what i want to show you next they 're monitoring their neighbors they can be planar formations they can be three dimensional formations so again these robots come really close together as you can see in this come within inches of each other they 're able to maintain stable flight so once you know how to fly in formation you can actually pick up objects cooperatively so this just shows that we can double triple robots ' strength by just getting them to team with neighbors as you can see here one of the disadvantages of doing that is as you scale things up so if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing another application i want to show you again this is in our lab this is work done by quentin lindsey so his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures so his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up when and where to place it so in this video you see and it 's sped up ten fourteen and all quentin has to do is to give them a blueprint of the design that he wants to build so all these experiments you 've seen thus far all these demonstrations have been done with the help of motion capture systems so what happens when you leave so this furniture and it then figures out where its position the coordinate system is defined based on the robot where it is and what it 's looking at so i want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by frank shen and professor nathan michael so the robot then figures out what the features are it builds the map it figures out so this robot is actually being commanded remotely by frank so suppose i were to send this into a building and i had no idea what this building looked like i can ask this robot to go in but it 's figuring out what the best point b is at every time so i have to conclude with something focused on entertainment who created this video so before i play this video i want to tell you that they created it in the last three days and of course it 's made exclusively for ted two thousand and twelve twelve let 's watch live watch"
