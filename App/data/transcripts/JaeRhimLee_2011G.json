  "transcript": "so some of you may know about the chemical bisphenol a it 's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that 's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics so bpa mimics the body 's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems and it 's everywhere a recent study found but it 's just one chemical the center for disease pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury first don 't become a cannibal and third our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins so what happens and this includes five thousand pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year and in a traditional it 's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition we deny death poison the living and further harm the science and culture the infinity burial project an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies the infinity burial project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the infinity mushroom leaving clean compost but i learned it 's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom i also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms so i thought maybe i could train an army of i 'm collecting what i shed or slough off my hair skin and nails i pick the best feeders to become infinity mushrooms so when i die the infinity mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it all right so for some of you this may be really really out there i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food cultivating the infinity mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet it 's a step it 's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture a concept that was developed by an entomologist timothy myles the infinity mushroom is a subset of decompiculture i 'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation once it 's completed i plan to integrate the infinity mushrooms into a number of objects first a burial suit infused with mushroom spores i 'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit it 's covered with a crocheted netting i 'm also making a decompiculture kit a cocktail of capsules that contain infinity mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects or not a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms i wanted to cultivate this perspective so i formed the decompiculture society a group of people called decompinauts seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the infinity mushroom the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture a radical of death and decomposition accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment as the research on environmental toxins confirms we came from dust and will return to dust we see that the survival of our species i believe thank you"
