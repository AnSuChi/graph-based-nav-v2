  "transcript": "and that 's not a joke we really do so come up afterwards and i 'll show you how to play a lobster so actually i started working on what 's called the mantis shrimp a few years because they make sound this is a recording i made of a mantis shrimp and while that 's an absolutely fascinating sound it actually turns out to be a very difficult project and while i was struggling and i started to think well maybe it will while listening to their sounds to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes and so today i 'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike work that i 've done in collaboration with wyatt korff and roy caldwell so mantis shrimp come in two varieties and he catches things that go by overhead so a quick strike like that and if we slow it down a bit this is the mantis shrimp the same species and you can see it 's just a really spectacular exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that i had offered it now the other type of mantis shrimp and these guys open up snails for a living and so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good play it one more time he wiggles it in place tugs it with his nose and smash and a few smashes later so the smasher raptorial appendage and so the first question that came to mind was well how fast does this limb move because it 's moving pretty darn fast and so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time and then a bbc crew came cruising through the biology department looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology and so we struck i said well if you guys rent the high speed video system that could capture these movements you guys can film us it 's very new technology it just came out about a year ago that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light and low light is a critical issue with filming animals because if it 's too high fry them so and the snail 's wired to a stick so he 's a little bit easier to set up the shot and yeah i hope there aren 't any and as you 'll notice it 's still pretty gosh darn fast the whole limb extends out the body flexes backwards just a so what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from ten meters per second all the way up to twenty three meters per second and for those of you who prefer miles per hour that 's over and this is really darn fast in fact it 's so fast we were able to add a new point so our first surprise so that was really cool and very unexpected so you might be wondering well how do they do it and actually this work was done in the 1960s by a famous and what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what 's called a catch mechanism or click mechanism and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that and nothing happens and once the muscle 's contracted completely everything 's stored up the latch flies upward and and a very short time for the limb to fly out but then i took a trip to backstage of the national museum of natural history is one of the world 's best collections of preserved mantis this is serious business for me so this what i saw on every single mantis shrimp limb whether it 's a spearer or a smasher is a beautiful saddle shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb and it 's surrounded by membranous areas and those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible and this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while and then we did a series of calculations and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring there needs to be some kind of and the output of the system this must be and then if you take a look at the video it 's a little bit hard to see it 's outlined in yellow the saddle is outlined in yellow you can actually see it extending so we 've had very solid evidence showing that that because it 's a very strong surface in compression it has curves in two directions one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface so it 's very well known to to engineers not as well known to biologists it 's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry because it requires very little material to build this type of surface and it 's very strong so if you 're going to build a thin gold structure it 's very nice to have it in a shape that 's also known to architects and one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it 's he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that 's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points and all of these are the same principles that apply to the saddle shaped spring in stomatopods in biological systems it 's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it so very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds and interestingly this turns out the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid a load cell measures forces and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it and when this crystal is squeezed the electrical properties change and it which in proportion to the forces that go in so these animals and so this is this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell and we were able to get some force measurements out and again we were in and i 've clocked these animals generating well two hundred pounds of force and again i think this will be a world record i have to do a little bit more background reading but i think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal of a given per body mass so really incredible forces and again that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system things i 'm making this very easy this is actually a lot of work and i got all these force measurements and then i went and looked at the force output of the system and this is just very simple time is on the and that was what really got me puzzled but there 's a really large second peak half a millisecond later you 'd expect a second peak for other reasons but not half a half a millisecond later again going back to those high speed videos there 's a pretty good hint of what might be going on there 's that raptorial appendage there 's the heel and it 's going to swing around and hit the load cell and what i 'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on the surface of the load cell as the limb comes and i hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light audience wow sheila patek and what that is is cavitation and cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds and so here it is in the stomatopod and again this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon because it destroys boat propellers people have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn 't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it just like these pictures show so this is a potent force in fluid systems and i have to give full credit to the bbc cameraman tim green for setting this shot up because i could never have done this in a million years one of the benefits of of working with professional cameramen you can see it coming in and an incredible flash of light and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail slowed down extremely to extremely slow speeds and again we can see it in slightly different form there and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring but the extremes of the fluid dynamics and they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail so really fascinating double whammy so to speak from these animals so one question i often get after this talk so i figured i 'd answer it now is well what happens to the animal but one of the convenient things about being an arthropod and they build a new limb and it 's no very convenient solution to that particular problem so i 'd like to end on sort of a wacky note laughter maybe this is all wacky to to folks like you i don 't know so the saddles that saddle shaped spring has actually been well known to and there 's actually a spectacular and this is quite interesting to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on and i think one explanation for this could be going back to and they 're literally unable to strike or they will this is for real and what they do is up until that time period when they can 't strike they become really obnoxious and awful and they strike everything in sight it doesn 't matter who or what and the second they get into that time point when they can 't strike any more their legs around and it 's one of the classic well established fact of these animals that they actually bluff they can 't actually strike but they pretend to and so i 'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike or their strike force and something about the time period in the molting cycle so sort of an interesting so to conclude i mostly want mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators wyatt korff and roy caldwell who worked closely with me on this and also the miller institute for basic research in science which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time and for that i 'm very grateful thank you very much"
