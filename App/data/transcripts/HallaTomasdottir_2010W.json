  "transcript": "and i could basically come out here and say only good things about us but in the last couple of years we 've become infamous for a couple of things first of course the economic meltdown it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on ebay then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of none of your media got it right which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin who you see in the picture in the spring of two thousand and seven just over a year before the economic why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit and i 'm not here to say that men are to blame but i can surely tell you that in my country much like on wall street and the city of london and elsewhere men and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems so we decided a bit fed up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn 't sustainable to found a financial services firm based on our values values and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance raised quite a few eyebrows in iceland we weren 't known as the typical so it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients and although i want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that and also there 's a factor of luck and timing and we will not invest in things we don 't understand but in two thousand and seven at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures it was quite opposite to the reckless we also believe in telling it as it is using simple language that people understand telling people about the and we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence it is actually people that make money and lose money not excel spreadsheets we believe in profit plus positive social and environmental benefits when we invest it 's the female trend and it 's the sustainability trend that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men it is actually about women being different from men bringing different values and different ways to the table so what do you get you get better europe looks pretty bad right now and many would say that you in america are heading for some more trouble as well now that we 've had all that happen and we have all this data out there telling us that it 's much better to have diversity around well i 'll give you my straight talk about this but i have days that i 'm full of doubt have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us einstein said that this was the definition of insanity hoping that this time it 's not going to collapse upon us i want to see more revolutionary and they are going to start voting with their wallets and i want to tell you when i first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society i was seven it happened to be my mother 's birthday october and nothing worked five years later iceland elected vigdis finnbogadottir as their president first female to become and at one of the campaign sessions she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn 't become president and even half a woman because she came back not just because of his crappy behavior but she came back i 'm actually not going to breastfeed the icelandic nation i 'm going to lead it so i 've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced but i 've come to conclude lately that it isn 't like that we are not the same and it 's great because of our differences we create and sustain life so we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge the final thought i want to leave with you is that fed up with this tyranny of either or choices in life either it 's men or it 's women so let 's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there and let 's start thinking about"
