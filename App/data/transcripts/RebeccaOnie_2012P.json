  "transcript": "but was paired with this and over the course of nine months i had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income families in boston but he hasn 't paid his rent of course because he 's paying for his hiv medication and just can 't afford both wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning and we always won because the they were already in so i called barry and with his blessing in october walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at boston medical center i never forget the tvs played this endless reel of cartoons the doctors it seemed never really had enough time for all the patients try as they might and over the course of six months i would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question if you had unlimited resources what 's the one thing you would give your patients and i heard the same story again and again a story we 've heard hundreds of times since then the real issue is that child is living with twelve other and i don 't even have any help so health leads was born of these conversations a simple model where doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well trained college student advocates who work side by side so eighteen months ago i got this email that changed my life and the email was from dr jack geiger who had written to congratulate me on health leads and to share as he said a bit of historical context in and so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them and they sent this bureaucrat down to tell geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care to which geiger famously and logically responded the last time i checked my textbooks the specific therapy for malnutrition was food so but the truth is i was devastated and i have doctors telling me on how is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients and especially low income patients healthy that we didn 't use it if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system why don 't we just do it these questions in my mind are not hard because the answers are complicated they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves my belief is that it 's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for but that doesn 't change my belief that all of us share a similar set of desires that if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare that it keep us healthy and the way i think about this is that healthcare is like any other system it 's just a set of choices that people make what if we decided to make a different set of choices they will be used to realize our aspiration so that 's where health leads we started with the prescription pad a very ordinary piece of paper and we asked not what do patients need to get healthy antibiotics an inhaler medication so just a few miles from here at children 's national medical center when patients come into they 're asked are you running out of food at the end of the month do you have safe housing but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient using health leads like any other the problem is once you get a taste of what it 's like to realize your aspiration for could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption so now at harlem hospital center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for health leads our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities so on the one hand this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record and on the other hand it 's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool but in my world it 's called reduced obesity and it 's called healthcare they sit we all just sit there forever waiting how did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting if airports can become shopping malls surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room and that 's what health leads has tried to the waiting room became the place where health leads turned your heat back on and of course all of this requires a broader workforce but if we 're creative we already have that too we know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren 't enough that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining health just takes more time it requires a army of community health unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using google now lest you think it improbable that a college volunteer can make now we may think that 's good or bad but in either case it 's real and health leads is based on the presumption that for too too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities college sports teams say we 're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we 're going to measure your performance and your team 's performance and if you don 't measure up or you don 't show up we 're going to cut you off the team but we 'll make huge investments in your training and development and we 'll give you an and people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it so our feeling is if it 's good enough for the rugby team it 's good enough for health and poverty demands significant time builds a cohesive team and measures results a kind of teach for america for each of those has at least twenty thousand college students new york alone has half a million college students and this isn 't just a sort of short term workforce to connect patients to basic resources it 's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who 've spent two three four years in the clinic waiting room and they leave with the conviction the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care but for three years as an undergraduate she was a health leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at they think their work is done when i write a prescription i think can the family read the prescription do they have insurance to fill the prescription those are the questions i learned at health leads not in medical school now none of these solutions the prescription pad the electronic medical record the waiting room the army of college students are perfect but they are ours for the taking simple examples of the vast healthcare resources that if we reclaimed and redeployed could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare and i knew i had to tell jeff purcell my attorney that i needed to leave and i was so nervous because i thought and i sat down with him and i said jeff i have this idea that we could mobilize college students to address patients ' most basic health needs but he said this when you have a vision you have an obligation to realize that vision you must pursue that vision and i have to say i was like whoa i believe that but by how rarely we needed them and most of all i believe that when we measure healthcare thank you"
