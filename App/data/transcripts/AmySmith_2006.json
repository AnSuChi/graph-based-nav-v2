  "transcript": "it 's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world it addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet which is malnutrition no it 's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires acute respiratory infections caused by this can you believe that i find this shocking and somewhat appalling can 't we make cleaner burning cooking i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of of carbon nanotubes so i 'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro tubes which is charcoal so this is a picture of rural percent deforested it leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the throughout the nation a couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths that 's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil so the rains come they go down the rivers and now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this people need to cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it it 's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage they know perfectly well but they have no other choice fossil fuels are not available and solar energy doesn 't cook the way that they like their food prepared and so this this is what they do you 'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it so not surprisingly there 's a lot of effort that 's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels about four years ago i took a team of students down to haiti and we worked with peace corps volunteers there this is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked and the idea was that you could take waste paper you could compress it and make and one of the things that they found was they didn 't burn so it was a little discouraging to the students right here you can see it says us peace corps and while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his and so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level you see these all over haiti as well they 're small scale sugar mills and the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called bagasse it has no other use it has no nutritional value so they don 't feed it to the animals it just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with so over the next couple of years students so you start with the so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes and conveniently one of my students was from ghana and so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava is indeed grown in haiti under the name of manioc tapioca manioc cassava it 's all the same thing a very starchy root and you can make a very thick sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes so we charbon or charcoal institute and these that 's right so i 'm actually an instructor at mit as well as and these are the briquettes that we made now i 'm going to take you to a different continent this is india and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in india it 's cow dung and more than in haiti this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with so we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal making technology there well unfortunately they didn 't have sugarcane and they didn 't have cassava but that didn 't stop us and we did side by side tests and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung and you can see that it 's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel and in fact it heats the water a lot thus far but one of the things that we found was when we did side by side comparisons with wood charcoal it didn 't burn as long and the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking so we so we went back to mit we took out the instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it and at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this we also had community partners in haiti working to develop the process to improve it and make it more and after some time we developed low cost press that allows you to produce charcoal which actually now burns not only so now we 're in a situation where we have a product which is actually better than what you can buy in haiti in the marketplace which is a very wonderful place to be in haiti alone about thirty million trees are cut down every year there 's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of in addition the revenue generated from that charcoal is two hundred and sixty million dollars that 's an awful lot for a country like haiti with a population of eight million and an average income so this is where we 're also moving ahead with our charcoal project and one of the things that i think is also interesting is i have a a friend up at uc berkeley who 's been doing risk analysis and he 's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal and he 's found that worldwide you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel that 's remarkable but up until now there weren 't ways to do it without cutting down trees but now we have a way that 's using an agricultural waste material if you can imagine such a thing here it is so what is this this is corncobs turned into charcoal and the beauty of this is that you don 't need to form briquettes it comes ready made this is my $ one hundred laptop right here so we can pass these around they 're fully functional field tested ready to roll out and i think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology is that the technology transfer is compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder this comes pre briquetted and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life ok so anyway and this is i think a perfect example of what robert wright was talking about in those but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products they can generate income from they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren 't making their own so this is a project that i just find extremely exciting and i 'm really really looking forward to see where it takes us so when we talk about now the future we will create one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in and now i don 't actually mean the world that we live in i mean the world i mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand and where when you work ten hours a day you 're still only earning sixty dollars in a month i mean the world where women and children spend forty billion hours a year fetching water that 's as if the entire workforce of the state of california worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water it 's a place where for example if this were india in this room only three of us would have a car if this were afghanistan only one person in this room would know how the use the internet if this were zambia and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a these are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for these are the issues that we need to be training our engineers our designers our business people our entrepreneurs to be facing these are the solutions that we need to find i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address one of them is creating technologies but there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own and we need to think about how we can do that effectively we need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems so we need to create this future thank you can maintain their own water systems know when they 're working know when they treat them etc we 're also looking at systems one of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that ca do you need to find or venture capitalists or what do you need to take what you 've got and get it to scale as it 's a difficult thing it 's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income so you can 't use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward and we 're a pretty small staff"
