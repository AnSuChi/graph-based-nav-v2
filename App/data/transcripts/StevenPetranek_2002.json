  "transcript": "cosmology are really extraordinary to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works than but there was something else that i 've noticed as those changes were taking place as people were starting to find out that hmm yeah there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy the science writers and editors i shouldn 't say science writers i should say people who write about science and at first it all seemed a little fantastical to me but i began to take a lot of them seriously and then september eleven happened and i thought ah god i can 't go to the ted conference and talk about how the world is going to end and that got me into a discussion with some other people other scientists about maybe some other subjects and one of the guys i talked to who was a neuroscientist said you know i think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up michael 's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can 't have a solution if you don 't have a we found them which leads me to a videotape of a president bush press we must pay it sp i agree with the president he wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year a two trillion dollar federal budget which will land us back into deficit spending real fast the only threat we face there are really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we 're in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism and what could 've happened on september eleven that if we took ten billion dollars from that two point one three of that budget and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems i 'm going to talk to you about the vast majority could be solved i hope you find this both fascinating i 'm fascinated by this kind of stuff i gotta admit to me these are richard 's cockroaches i hope you take some of this stuff away with you and when you have an opportunity to be influential so let 's start number ten we lose the will people around the world are getting better medicine we 're falling apart the world health organization now estimates that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed and the world health organization also says that depression is the soon genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of one hundred as a normal lifespan a female child born tomorrow on average median will live to age eighty three our life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes we don 't really have mental health insurance in this especially in clinically depressed people you ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist we know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with and we know just an amazing amount more about the through nih and national science nsf moving on number nine don 't laugh ten years ago you couldn 't have found an astronomer well very few astronomers in the world who would 've told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we found three the count now is up to eighty we 're finding about two or three a month and as carl sagan insisted there must be billions and billions in the universe in a few years nasa is going to launch four or five telescopes out to jupiter where there 's less dust and start looking for earth like planets it 's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in and the chance that some of it isn 't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea remember we 've only been an advanced civilization an industrial civilization if you would for two hundred years although every time i go to pompeii i 'm amazed that they had the a mcdonald 's on every street corner too so i don 't know how much civilization really has progressed since ad seventy nine but and i don 't believe there are any aliens on the earth or anything like that but suck up our oceans for the hydrogen and swat us away like flies we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it we can look at our own history the late physicist gerard o 'neill said advanced western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with even in those cases where every attempt was made to protect and guard the primitive civilization if the aliens come visiting so what are the solutions to this thank god you can all read it may seem ridiculous but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them how much energy and money and you 're going to hear more from me about this we have to become an we have to colonize the milky way and that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point it 'll if we 're trying to be an advanced civilization the journal science and we want to tell you they 're not in trouble they 're near collapse many other ecosystems on earth are in real real the rain forest collapses the problem with with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly that we don 't know they 're really in trouble until it 's almost too late we need to know earlier and we need to and with the kind of computing power we have now there is as i say some of this going on but it needs money national science foundation needs to say secondly we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet and start moving them around there 's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the georges bank let it recover you all remember ted kaczynski the unabomber one of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world a lot of very sober minded physicists believe it or not have had exactly the same thought this spring there 's a collider at brookhaven on long island it 's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes they are expecting they expect them to evaporate i hope they 're right other collider experiments there 's one that 's going to take place next summer at cern have the possibility of creating something called strangelets which are kind of like antimatter whenever they hit other matter they destroy it in japan in canada but there 's talk of building very we need to we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics and what should be done in particle physics but we need some secondly we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth we have and it 's constantly bombarded and in my opinion we don 't spend enough time number six biotech disaster it 's one of my favorite ones because we 've done several stories on bt corn bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer especially when all those taco shells were taken and somebody should 've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily but the thing that 's alarming is a couple of months ago in mexico in mexico this brings back a skepticism that has gone that literally could destroy the world 's food supply in very short order so what do we do about that this is an amazingly unregulated field when the starlink disaster happened there was a battle between north pole goes to the south south pole goes to the north and vice as this occurs is that we lose our magnetic field around the earth and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun that this we 're gonna fry oh by the way we 're overdue it 's been seven hundred and eighty thousand years since this happened so it should have happened about four hundred and eighty thousand years ago oh and here 's one other thing scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five maybe we 're in the throes of it one of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the earth is is that we there 's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that 's going to come online in about six or seven years that gets us into the low atmosphere very we need to learn how to repair and replenish the earth 's ozone giant solar flares solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the sun that bombard the earth with high speed subatomic particles we get a flare from the sun that causes havoc with but the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our sun and they 've found that a number of them when they 're about the age of our sun brighten by a factor of as much as twenty and they think these are super flares millions of times more powerful than any flares we 've had from our sun so far side to it in studying stars like our sun we 've found that they go through periods of diminishment when their total amount of energy that 's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent one percent doesn 't sound like a lot but it would cause one hell of an ice age here so what can we do about this start terraforming mars this is one of my favorite subjects i wrote a story about this in life magazine in rocket science but it 's not hard rocket science is probably there and you just literally have to send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of mars and spit out the oxygen the problem is it takes three hundred years to terraform mars there 's no reason why we shouldn 't start now number three isn 't this stuff cool a new global epidemic people have been at war with germs ever since there have been people and from time to time the we had a flu epidemic in the united states that killed twenty million people that was back when the population the bubonic plague in europe in the middle ages killed one out of aids is coming back ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency we 've all the worst possibility is that a very simple germ like staph for which we have one antibiotic that still works mutates and we know staph can do and will sweep through there was a massive so what can we do about it it is nuts we give antibiotics every cow every lamb every chicken they get antibiotics every day all you know you go to a restaurant you eat fish i got news for you it 's all farmed you know you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it 's a wild fish cause they 're not going to tell we 're telling the germs out there how to fight us is a real disaster we have a real major there is money number two my favorite ten years ago or fifteen years ago really you walk into an astronomy convention and now if you went into one of those conventions and you said well i don 't think our comprehension of the way the universe works is really has just gained and they are black holes and they are gobbling up everything around them most of them should be in orbit around something but and also space is incredibly vast so even if you but it only it only has to get close about a billion miles away one of these things and for three months out of the year the surface temperatures go up to one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty for three months out of the year they go to fifty below zero what can we do about this and this is my scariest and finally number one the important thing to remember here this is piece of a comet exploded over siberia and flattened forests for maybe one hundred miles it had the effect of about one thousand hiroshima bombs astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years in we were in that that spot six hours earlier a small asteroid say a half mile wide would touch off firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up carl sagan 's nuclear winter thing an asteroid five miles wide where are they that 's where pluto is it 's in the kuiper belt there are about one hundred thousand balls of ice and rock comets really out there and they regularly take a little spin in towards the sun and pass reasonably close to us of more concern i think is the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter the folks at the sloan digital sky survey told us last fall they 're making the first map of the universe three dimensional map of the universe that there are probably seven hundred thousand asteroids between mars and jupiter that are a half a mile big or bigger so you say yeah well andrew can you put that chart up you 'll notice that the chance of an now look at the one right below that passenger aircraft we spend an awful lot of money and we 're not spending hardly anything nasa 's spending three million dollars a year three million bucks that is like pocket change and when at spending three million dollars a year and even then they claim they 'll only have about eighty percent of them catalogued comets are a tougher act we don 't really have the technology to predict but we would have lots of time you 'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of amateur part two of the solutions a year ago we did an amazing thing we sent a probe out to this we have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid it 's not a big deal now the trouble with just sending a bomb out but we don 't really have anything big enough but we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it slowly after a period of time push it into a different trajectory which if we 've done our math right this is just a matter of finding ' em going there and doing something about it i know your head is spinning from all this stuff"
