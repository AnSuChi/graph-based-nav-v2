  "transcript": "living on less than one dollar a day snobbish expensive education i was all set to be a diplomat teacher doctor all laid out i don 't look it but i was the indian national squash champion for three years laughter the whole world was laid out for me everything was at my feet i could do nothing wrong and then i thought out of curiosity i 'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like so i went to what was called the worst bihar famine in india and i saw starvation death people dying of hunger for the first time it changed my life i came back home told my mother i 'd like to live and work in a village mother went into a coma the whole world is laid out for you the best jobs are laid out for you and you want to go and work in a village i mean is there something wrong with you i said no i 've and i wanted to give something back in my own way no money no security no prospect i said i want to live and dig wells for five years wells for five years you went to the most expensive school and college in india and you want to dig wells for five years she didn 't speak to me for but then i was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have which are never brought into the mainstream and i thought i 'd start a barefoot college what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college i elders came to me and said are you the education system in india makes you look look at paris and new delhi and what are you doing in this village is there something wrong actually start a college only for the poor they said please don 't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college so it 's the only college in india where if you should have a ph d or a master 's you are disqualified to come you have to be a cop out or a wash out or a dropout you have to have a dignity of labor you have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service so we started and we redefined professionalism confidence and belief a water diviner is a professional a traditional midwife is a professional a traditional bone setter and we thought that these people should come into and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal it needs to be used needs to be applied needs to be shown to the world outside so the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of mahatma you 'll come to the barefoot college that is where we want you to try crazy ideas whatever idea you have come and try battered bruised you start again it 's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher you don 't need a paper to hang on the wall to show so when i said that they said well show us what is possible what are you doing this is all mumbo jumbo if you can 't show it on the ground so we built the first barefoot college in it was built by twelve barefoot architects who can 't read and write built on $ one worked there they got the aga khan award for architecture in two thousand and two but then they suspected but the barefoot architects actually constructed the college we are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ fifty thousand because they didn 't believe us and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the barefoot architects of tilonia what can you build in this place he had one look at the soil and said forget it no way no water rocky soil and i said okay i 'll go to the old man in village and say ' what should i grow in this spot ' he looked quietly at me and said you build this you build this you put this and is what it looks like today and all the women said clear out the men should clear out because we don 't want to share this technology with the men this is waterproofing the roof it is a bit of jaggery a bit of urens and a bit of other things i don 't know but it actually doesn 't leak it hasn 't leaked all the power comes from the sun forty five kilowatts of panels on the roof and everything works off the sun for the next twenty five years so long as the sun shines we 'll have no problem with power but the beauty is that is was installed by a priest a hindu priest who 's only done eight years of primary schooling he knows more about solar than anyone i know anywhere in the world guaranteed but the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women illiterate women they 're so precise to the last inch they can make that cooker and we have sixty meals twice a day of solar cooking we have a dentist she 's a grandmother illiterate who 's a dentist she actually looks after the teeth of seven thousand children barefoot technology no engineer no architect thought of it but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs if we have four years of drought we still have water on the campus because we collect rainwater because they have to look after animals so we thought of starting a school at night for the children because the night schools of tilonia over seventy five thousand children citizenship how you should measure your land what you should do if you if your animal is sick this is what we teach in the night schools but all the schools every five years we have an election between six to fourteen year old children and they elect a prime minister the prime minister is twelve years old she has a cabinet a and they actually monitor and supervise one hundred and fifty schools for seven thousand children she got the world 's children 's prize five years ago and she went never seen turned to me and said can you ask this child where she got her confidence from she 's only twelve years old and she 's not dazzled by anything turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said please tell where the percentage of illiteracy is very high we use puppetry you have he actually raises money solves my disputes if there 's tension the attendance must not drop these puppets are made out of recycled world bank reports we 've covered all over india from ladakh up to bhutan and we asked this woman this because there 's no place it was all snowed up on both sides and we asked this woman what was the benefit you had from solar electricity and she thought for a minute and said it 's the first time i can see my husband 's face in winter one lesson we learned and they all want a certificate all across the globe you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate why because they want to leave the village so we came up with a great solution train grandmothers what 's the best way of communicating in the world today afghanistan for the first time and we picked three women and said we want to take them to india they said impossible they don 't even go out of their rooms and you want to take them to india i said i 'll make a concession i 'll take the husbands along as well so i took the husbands along of course the women were much more intelligent than the men six months and in six months they can this woman went back and set up a workshop the first village ever to be solar electrified in afghanistan [ was ] by the three women this woman is an extraordinary grandmother fifty five years old and she 's solar electrified two hundred houses for me in afghanistan and they haven 't collapsed she actually went and spoke to an engineering department in afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between ac and dc he didn 't know we went to and we did the same thing all these women sitting at one table from eight nine countries all chatting to each other not understanding a word because they 're all speaking a different language but their body language is great i went to and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night comes across this village comes back goes into the village says there 's a solar electrified village in sierra leone he said no half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day what 's the story so he summoned me and said can you train me one hundred and fifty grandmothers and one hundred and fifty grandmothers i knew which woman i would like to take the community got together and said take these two women up on the mobile she went like a grandmother she walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she and she was a star and when i went back six months later i said where 's your husband for solutions within and listen to people they have the solutions in front of you they in the world i 'll end with a quotation by mahatma gandhi first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you"
