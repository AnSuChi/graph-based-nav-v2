  "transcript": "so raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness yeah and raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness in humans as we heard from dr insel this morning psychiatric disorders like autism depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of if you 're concerned about a cancer diagnosis biopsies and blood tests in two thousand and thirteen if you 're concerned about a depression diagnosis you go to your doctor and what do you get a questionnaire now as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine but that can 't be the answer because these drugs actually don 't work all that well a lot of people won 't take them or stop taking them because of their unpleasant side effects these drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block some of it will dribble into the right place but a lot of it will do more harm than good now an emerging view that you also heard about from dr insel this morning is that psychiatric disorders are mood and affect well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion it 's just that we don 't tend to think about it that way rather they 're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry it 's helpful to work on what we biologists call model organisms animals like fruit flies and laboratory so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron and we find that a behavior is blocked we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient in this way by doing this kind of test we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits but can an organism like a fruit fly which is it 's a great model organism it 's capable of charles darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors as he wrote in on the expression of the emotions in man and animals and my eponymous colleague seymour benzer believed it as well seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila here at caltech in the ' 60s as a model organism seymour recruited me to caltech in the late but how do we actually find out whether that 's true or not now in humans we often infer emotional states 's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies it 's kind of like landing on mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out how do i find out if they have emotions or not what can 's not so easy so three important ones that i can think of are gradations in intensity and valence tears pour down so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic and what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puff o mat several puffs in a row they became somewhat hyperactive so we quantified this behavior using and what this quantification showed us is that upon experiencing a train of these air puffs the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent long lasting and also appears to be graded make the state last for a longer period of time so we decided to use our puff o mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant there are repositories where you can it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor that 's right flies like people have dopamine and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and i have dopamine plays a number of important functions and adhd we tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn 't happen when we take it away so when we take away the dopamine receptor and the flies take longer to calm down from that we infer that the normal increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate dea license we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do and that 's also reminiscent of so slowly i began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder now individuals afflicted with adhd also have learning disabilities is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies as seymour showed back in the 1970s flies like songbirds as you just heard are capable of learning shown here in blue if you pair that odor with a shock then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the well if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies they don 't learn their learning score is zero they flunk out of caltech so that means that these flies have two abnormalities or phenotypes as we geneticists call them that one finds in now what 's the causal relationship if anything between these phenotypes and a final possibility is that there 's no relationship all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in adhd but in flies we can actually test this and the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies but they still can 't learn but they 're still hyperactive it 's acting to but these kinds of results should at a bag of chemical soup we can do that we"
