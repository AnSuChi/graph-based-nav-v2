  "transcript": "silicon valley is obsessed with disruption the panhandle in florida and this last us presidential election was the mother of all disruptions politics is personal pouring into the streets in record numbers in record time the election has done to family holiday dinners what uber has done to new york city any cardio benefit i get is instantly obliterated when i read another presidential tweet on the headline scroll even my secret pleasure of studying the italian painters have been infected by politics even stalk the old masters this is my desk with a postcard exhibition of some famous and obscure paintings mostly from the italian now art used to provide me with a necessary break from the hurly burly of politics in my daily work at the aclu but not anymore and the crowd was chanting this is what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like and there i was holding my sign and my umbrella in the rain and i flashed on an old painting that first captivated me many years ago i struggled to remember the different pieces of an actual painting of good and bad government it was almost like the old master was taunting me you want to know what democracy looks like and so i did in ambrogio lorenzetti finished a monumental commission in the governing council chamber of siena 's palazzo pubblico it 's a painting that speaks to us even screams to us today art is a lie that makes us pablo picasso once said and as we search for the truth about government we should keep ambrogio 's work not a lie during lorenzetti 's time the political legitimacy of italian but there had been enormous unrest in the two decades leading up to the commission siena 's political leaders who would literally govern under the eyes of these allegorical figures were lorenzetti 's intended audience he was cataloging the obligations of the governing you can spend years studying these frescoes some scholars have i 'm hardly an art historian the majestic figure here in the middle is dressed in siena 's colors and he personifies the republic itself lorenzetti labels him now surrounding commune are his advisors she 's looking up at the figure of wisdom who actually supports her scales of justice holds a string that comes off the scales of justice that binds her to the citizens making them all compatriots in the republic when good government rules peace doesn 't break a sweat now but i really love the small stuff along another wall lorenzetti illustrates the effects of good government on the real and everyday lives of ordinary people with a series of delicious little details crops are being sown crops and livestock are being brought to market in the city builders raise a tower people attend a law lecture a ted talk of the 14th century whose banner reads everyone shall go forth freely without fear now what 's amazing about these images from eight hundred years ago is that they 're familiar to us today we see what democracy looks like we experience the effects of good government in our lives just as lorenzetti did in his life and ruling over bad government is not the commune he has horns he obviously spends a lot of time on that hair justice shackled her scales have been severed now surrounding the tyrant lorenzetti illustrates the vices that animate bad government avarice is the old woman clutching the and a fisherman 's hook to pull in her fortune and lorenzetti warns us against narcissistic leaders who are guided by their own ego and vanity on the tyrant 's right is cruelty lulls us into a false sense of security and then poisons a republic fraud with the flighty wings of a bat on the tyrant 's left you see division she 's dressed in siena 's colors si and no are painted on her body she uses a carpenter 's saw to chop her body in half and the stone and knife in the remainder of the fresco lorenzetti and we see it the farms abandoned many are in flames and in the sky above is not the winged figure whose banner reads none shall pass along this road without fear of death today the audience for lorenzetti 's frescoes is not the governing the individual who stands in front of his allegories and walks away with insight who even tyranny and we must act the right to protest the right to assemble freely the right to petition one 's government these are obligations we have to disrupt we have to disrupt our lives so that we can disrupt the amoral accretion of power by those who would betray our values we and we the people must raise justice up and we have a choice we could either paint ourselves into the worst nightmare of lorenzetti 's bad government or we can stay loud that is what democracy looks like you spoke to many people passionately here i 'm sure there are other people here who 'd say look shouldn 't you give him a chance anthony romero i think we have to recognize the legitimacy of him as president and when so many of the policies that we 're all equal under the law that we 're not judged by the color of our skin or the religion we worship we have to contest those values even as we recognize and honor the fact that our democracy rendered us a president who is championing those values you 're making other arguments as well and we recently were and we even wrote a blog that unfortunately when we talked about the fact that even donald trump has free speech rights as president and an effort to hold him accountable for incitement of violence at his marches or his rallies is unconstitutional and un american and when you put that statement out there to a very frothy base that always is very excited for you to fight donald trump and then you have a new one even the president that we don 't like and that 's our job ca anthony you spoke to so many of us so powerfully thank you so much"
