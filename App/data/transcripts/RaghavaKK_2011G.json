  "transcript": "it 's a little quirky and silly it 's called little kids do with their parents you can make the baby poop you can do but you know i have a problem with children 's books i think they 're full of propaganda at least an indian trying to get one of these american books in park slope forget it it 's not the way i was brought up so i said i 'm going to counter this with my own propaganda if you notice carefully it 's a homosexual couple bringing up a child you and you have a lesbian couple sisters and i am and i 'd go at the end of the day to a traditional hindu house which was probably the only hindu house in a predominantly islamic neighborhood i celebrated every religious function in fact when there was a wedding in our neighborhood all of us would paint our houses for the wedding i remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani laughter we all had to fast during it was a very beautiful time but i must say i 'll never forget when i was thirteen years old in the 16th century i was affected by this communal unrest my little my work is inspired by events such as this even in my gallery shows i try and revisit historic events like babri i have another idea it 's a children 's book and you get the british perspective you have to separate fact from bias right but they 're playing geopolitics they 're playing out and my argument [ is ] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage after all children 's books are manuals on parenting so you better give them children 's books that teach them perspectives and conversely only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different i can 't promise my child a life without bias we 're all biased but i promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives thank you very much"
