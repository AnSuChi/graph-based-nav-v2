  "transcript": "this is the venue where as a young man some of the music that i wrote was first performed it was remarkably a pretty good sounding room with all the uneven the nature of the room meant that words could be understood the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood the sound system was kind of decent and there wasn 't a lot of reverberation in the room so the rhythms could be pretty intact too pretty concise this is tootsie 's orchid lounge in nashville the music was in some ways different but in structure and form very much the and so the bands at tootsie 's or at cbgb 's had to play loud enough i 've played the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that exciting but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i didn 't sound all that great in some of those halls we managed but sometimes those halls didn 't seem exactly suited do i write stuff for specific rooms do i have a place a venue in mind when i write is that a kind of model for creativity do we all make things with a venue a context there 's no big room to the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification and it would be a mess in a context like this this is a gothic cathedral and it actually improves it this is the room that bach it 's not as big as a gothic cathedral so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate he can very innovatively this is the kind of rooms that mozart wrote in i think we 're in like one thousand seven hundred and seventy somewhere around there they 're smaller even less reverberant so he can write really frilly music the audience in these opera houses when they were built they used to yell out they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do at cbgb 's and places like that if they liked an aria they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately and that was an opera it 's smaller than this but wagner made an innovation he wanted a bigger band he wanted a little more bombast so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more obviously this kind of thing became popular the halls got bigger carnegie hall 's fair sized it 's larger than some of the other symphony halls and they 're a lot more reverberant than this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or so those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren 't in but because of the reverberation in those rooms like carnegie hall the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural according to scott joplin that the dancers really liked and they 'd say play that part again so the bands started to improvise and a new form of music was born these are played mainly in small rooms shouting and drinking so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that same thing goes true for that 's the beginning of the century for the it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century when this became and this was microphones enabled singers in particular and musicians and composers to completely change the kind of music that they were writing so far a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music but singers like frank sinatra could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone other singers and he 's singing right into your ear he 's whispering into your ears the effect is just electric it 's like the guy is sitting next to you whispering who knows what into your ear so and they no longer have to be exactly the same and there 's jukeboxes in bars where you don 't even need to have a band there doesn 't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever systems are good people began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems and as with jazz so the early hip hop guys would loop certain sections mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies and another new form of music was born basketball arenas and hockey arenas musicians who ended up there did the best they could they wrote what is now called arena rock which is situation and in some ways the music that they 're writing for this place works perfectly so there 's more new venues one of the new ones is the automobile i grew up with a radio in a car but now that 's evolved into something else the car is a whole venue i would say is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it but it works great in the car has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high end and the voice there 's one other kind of new venue presumably this is just for christian music laughter in some ways it 's like carnegie hall or when the audience had to hush up because you can now hear every single detail in other ways it 's more like the west african music because if the music in an mp3 player gets too quiet i think so i asked myself this adaptation that we do and according to david attenborough and some other people birds do it too their calls tend to be high pitched so that they don 't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor and birds like they tend to have a buzzing sound clip savannah and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and other birds like this tanager and the tananger primarily the form at least to fit and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls and if we write software to fit existing operating systems is that how it works but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something and i 'm saying well the passion 's still there but the vessel that it 's going to be injected into and poured into that is instinctively and intuitively created first we already know where that passion is going thomas frank says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests that voters like a lot of us assume that if they hear something that sounds like it 's sincere that it 's coming from the gut that it 's passionate that it 's more authentic so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion they stand a better chance of the passion the joy are mutually exclusive maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds we adapt the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much"
