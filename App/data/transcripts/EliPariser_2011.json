  "transcript": "and the journalist was asking him why is this so important and zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in africa and i want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when i was growing up it meant and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society so i first noticed this in a place i spend a lot of time my facebook page i 'm progressive politically big surprise but i 've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives i like hearing what they 're thinking about and what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on and it was noticing that actually i was clicking more on my liberal friends than on my conservative friends ' links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so facebook isn 't the only place that 's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web google 's doing it too if i search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time even if you 're logged out one engineer told me there are fifty seven signals that google looks at everything from what kind of computer you 're on to what kind of browser you 're using there is no standard and you know the funny thing about this is that it 's hard to see you can 't see how different your search results are from anyone else 's but a couple of weeks ago i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt so here 's my friend and here 's my friend daniel 's screen shot so it 's not just google and facebook huffington post the washington post the new york times all flirting with personalization in various ways and this this moves us very quickly but not necessarily what we need to as eric schmidt said it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them and i think if you take all of these filters together you take all these algorithms you get what i call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is and what 's in your filter bubble and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don 't decide what gets in and more importantly you don 't actually see so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at netflix and they were looking at the netflix queues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out so iron man zips right out and waiting for superman can wait for a really long time what they discovered was that in our netflix queues there 's this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched rashomon but right now we want to watch ace ventura for the fourth time so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they 're mainly looking at what you click on first and instead of a you can end up surrounded by information junk food and they controlled the flows of information but that 's not actually what 's happening right now what we 're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers and the thing is that the algorithms don 't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they 're going to decide what we get to see and what we don 't get to see then we need to make sure that they 're not just keyed to relevance we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable and fifteen it 's not like newspapers then people noticed that they were doing something really important that in fact you couldn 't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn 't get a good flow of information but it got us through the last century and we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they 're writing i know that there are a lot of people here from facebook and from google larry and people who have helped build the web as and i 'm grateful for that but we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn 't because i think we really need the internet to be that thing we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives and it 's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one"
