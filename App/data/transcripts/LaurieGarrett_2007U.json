  "transcript": "the first question is why do we need to even worry about a pandemic threat what is it that we 're concerned about when i say we i 'm at the council on foreign relations we 're concerned in the national security community and of course in public health community it 's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere all the time all over the world and that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you so a plague outbreak in surat india becomes not an obscure event but a globalized event a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand to be capable of handling things indeed an outbreak would be multiple katrinas at once our big concern at the moment is a virus called in the mid 1990s but we didn 't know about at the end of last christmas only thirteen countries had seen h5n1 but we 're now up to fifty five countries in the world have had this virus emerge in either birds or people or both in the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the americas it 's one of the most lethal things we 've seen in circulation in the world and we 've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers with the result that there 's cover up there has been this centralized event in a place called lake chenghai china two years ago the migrating which made the species range broaden dramatically so that birds going to siberia to europe and to africa carried the virus which had not previously been possible we 're now seeing outbreaks in human populations tiny outbreaks occasional clusters the virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families if you will of the h5n1 viral tree with branches in them and with different attributes that are worrying so what 's concerning us well first of all at no time in history have we succeeded in making in a timely fashion a specific vaccine for more than two hundred and sixty million people it 's not going you 've heard about the vaccine we 're stockpiling but nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real outbreak so one thought is after nine eleven when the airports closed our flu season was h5n1 spreading from human to human the virus has mutated to be a human to human transmitter let 's shut down the airports huge supercomputer analyses done of the likely effectiveness of this show that it won 't buy us much time at all and of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans for example all masks are made in china how do you get them mobilized around the world if you 've shut all the airports down so it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive we 're worried because this virus unlike any other flu we 've ever studied can be transmitted by eating we 've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats and now also domestic pet dogs and in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu seizures central nervous system disorders partial paralysis this is not your normal garden variety flu it mimics what we now understand about reconstructing and we don 't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease the result is that what kills you the virus directly but your own immune system we have seen human to human transmission in at least three clusters fortunately involving very intimate contact still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk now well the governments are going to do something and we have spent a lot of money most of the spending in the bush administration has actually been more related to the anthrax results and bio terrorism threat but a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level to look at infectious diseases end result only fifteen states have been certified to be able to do mass distribution of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic the states would run out of hospital beds in the first week maybe two weeks let 's everybody run around and play your role most of these people don 't actually know what their job will be and the bottom line major thing nobody knows the chain of command if it the federal government says it 's a guy called the principle federal officer who happens to be with tsa the government says the federal responsibility will basically be about trying to keep the virus out which we all know is impossible and then to mitigate the impact primarily on our economy everything is about your town where you live well how good a city council you have how good a mayor you have that 's who 's going to be in charge most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called tamiflu which may or may not be helpful i 'll get into that of available vaccines and any other treatments and masks and anything that 's been stockpiled and you 'll have massive competition now we did purchase a vaccine you 've probably all heard about it made by so here 's where the decisions come in in order to minimize the spread between households by household cats dogs and so on what do we do when we don 't have any containment rooms with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers to take care of patients these are in hong kong we have nothing like that here what about quarantine the sars epidemic in beijing quarantine did seem to help we have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the united states and some states have differential policies county by county six weeks they had all what they found was the core functions you know you still sort of had banks but you couldn 't get bankers we don 't know how important hand washing is for flu shocking since we know we won 't have enough masks because we don 't make them in america anymore they 're bingo they got sars it wasn 't flying microbes if you go online right now you 'll get so much phony baloney information you 'll end up buying this is called and tamiflu you 've probably heard of this drug made by hoffmann la roche patented drug there is some indication that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak should you take tamiflu for a long period of time well one of the side effects is suicidal ideations making matters worse and here is the other interesting thing when a human being ingests tamiflu only twenty percent is metabolized appropriately to be an active compound in the human being the rest thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing and in egypt in person to person transmission so russia has actually stockpiled enough for ninety five percent of all russians we 've stockpiled enough for thirty percent when i say enough that 's two weeks worth and then you 're on your own because the pandemic is going to last for eighteen to twenty four months some of the poorer countries that have had the most have built up stockpiles they 're already expired they and so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations all over america every city county state did their own thing and the rules in some the pandemic circulated three times in eighteen months in the absence of commercial air travel the second wave was the mutated super killer wave and in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers but by the time the second wave hit it took such a toll among the healthcare workers that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines overall we lost seven hundred thousand people the virus was one hundred percent lethal to pregnant women and we don 't actually year olds it was likened to the plague we don 't actually know how many people died the low ball estimate is thirty five million this was based on european and north american data a new study by chris murray at harvard shows that if you look at the databases that were kept by the brits in india there was a among the indians so so are we ready as a nation no we 're not and i think even those in the leadership would say that is the case that we still have a long ways to go so what does that mean for you well the first thing is i wouldn 't start building up personal stockpiles of anything well if you think it 's going to last eighteen going to buy eighteen months worth of masks for every single person in your family so then how can you tell who in your family has the flu if everybody is taking tamiflu you begin to realize how limited the tamiflu option might be everybody has come up to me and said well i 'll stockpile water or i 'll stockpile food or what have you but really do you really have a place to stockpile eighteen months worth of food twenty four months worth of food do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu and i hope i 've convinced you of that which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders and your national leaders why haven 't you solved these problems why are you still thinking that but and you are trying to plan at a minimum the british banking plan showed that telecommuting can be helpful it probably does reduce but happy to take your questions but i would say that honestly we don 't know clearly the and the moment that you see any evidence of serious human to human to transmission not just intimately between family members who took care of an ailing but a community infected send out the alert audience member some research has indicated that there is some evidence that taking lipitor and other common statins for cholesterol control may decrease your but we do not completely understand why the mechanism isn 't clear and i i don 't know that there is any way responsibly for someone to start medicating their children with their we have absolutely no idea what that would do you might be causing some very dangerous outcomes in your children doing such a thing audience member how far along are we in being able to determine whether someone is actually carrying whether somebody has this before the symptoms are full blown lg right so i have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic for disease control has labeled a test they developed a rapid diagnostic it takes twenty four hours in highly skilled hands i 'm thinking dipstick you could do it to your own kid it changes color it tells you if you have h5n1 in terms of where we are in science with dna identification but we 're not there and there hasn 't been the kind of investment to get us there audience member in the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen flu i understand was some attenuation of the virus when it made the leap into humans is that likely do you think here i mean one it 's curious that there is no evidence of mass die offs of chickens or household birds across america before the human pandemic happened that may be because but the virus clearly went through one round around the world in a mild enough form that the british army in world war i actually certified that it was not a threat and would not affect the outcome of the war and after circulating around the world came back in a form that was tremendously what percentage of infected people were killed by it again but we don 't really know one of the things i 've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia and that a pneumonia vaccine may researchers in emerging diseases were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat on the grounds that and that most people who die of regular flu which in regular flu years is about three hundred and sixty thousand people worldwide most of them senior citizens and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system and along comes pneumococcus or another bacteria streptococcus but it turns out that in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen that was not the case at all and so far in the h5n1 cases in people similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all it 's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system that is the key to why people die of this virus"
