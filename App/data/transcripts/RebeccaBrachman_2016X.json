  "transcript": "is a tuberculosis ward and at the time this picture was taken in the late 1800s one in seven of all people died from tuberculosis we had no idea what was causing this disease the hypothesis was actually and it was the disorder of poets and artists and intellectuals and some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity and conferred we instead knew that tuberculosis was caused by a highly contagious bacterial infection which is slightly less romantic but that had the upside of us being able to maybe develop drugs to treat it and they gave it to patients and patients were elated they were more social more energetic one medical report actually says they were dancing in the halls and unfortunately this was not necessarily because they were getting better a lot of them were still dying another medical report describes them as being but it requires more than just a happy accident you have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur as a neuroscientist i 'm going to talk to you a little bit about my firsthand experience with whatever you want to call the opposite of dumb luck let 's call it smart luck and at least in the united states though not necessarily in other countries we have closed our sanitoriums and probably most of you but a lot of what was true we are in the middle of an epidemic of mood disorders like depression and post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd which means that if you haven 't experienced it personally or someone in your family hasn 't though they may not talk about it depression has actually now surpassed diabetes and war and also like tuberculosis in the 1950s once it 's developed a lifetime and there are no known cures the second antidepressant we discovered also by accident in the 1950s from an antihistamine that was making people manic and in both the case of the tuberculosis ward and the antihistamine someone had to be able to recognize that a drug that was designed to do one thing treat tuberculosis or suppress allergies could be used to do something very different treat depression and this sort of repurposing is actually quite challenging when doctors first saw this mood enhancing effect of iproniazid they were so used to thinking about it from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug that they actually just listed it as a side effect an adverse side effect as you can see here a lot of these patients and they were worried that this might somehow interfere with their recovering from tuberculosis so they recommended that iproniazid only be used in cases of extreme tb which is of course the exact opposite of how we use it as an antidepressant and to be fair it 's not entirely their fault functional fixedness is is a bias that affects all of us it 's a tendency to only be able to think of an object in terms of its traditional use or function and mental set is another thing right that 's sort of this preconceived and that actually makes repurposing pretty hard for all of us which is i guess why they gave a tv show to the guy who was like really great at repurposing so the effects in both the case of but it does make you wonder what else we 've missed so one they weight gain of over fifty pounds and that serotonin so we developed drugs to and since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs suicidality and they take a really long time to work something like four to six weeks in a lot of patients and that 's in which is kind of the difference between taking a painkiller for an infection versus an antibiotic a painkiller will make you feel better but is not going to do anything to treat that underlying disease fixated on we try and remove our bias right running double blinded experiments or being statistically agnostic as to what our results will be but bias creeps in more insidiously in what we choose to study often to the exclusion of other things we still have no cures and what if serotonin it will never lead to a cure in the past few years doctors have discovered probably what is the first truly new antidepressant since the and it doesn 't work on serotonin it took us twenty years to realize that calypsol was an antidepressant despite the fact that it 's actually a better antidepressant probably than those other and we were studying calypsol as an antidepressant in mice so we would give an injection to mice and then we 'd run another experiment to save money so we could have stopped there so i went back and we and it looked kind of like this so if you look at the far left if you put a mouse in a new space this is the box it 's very exciting a mouse will walk around and explore and you can see that pink line is actually and we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup and which is the middle box they aren 't social they don 't explore they mostly just kind of hide in that back corner behind a cup yet the mice that had so we could have just stopped there but christine had also used calypsol before as anesthesia and a few years ago she had seen that it seemed to have some weird effects on cells and some other behavior that also seemed and we ran it again and i remember being in the animal room moving mice from box to box to test them and christine was actually sitting on the floor with the computer in her lap so the mice couldn 't see it seemed like these mice were protected against stress and so we ran it again and every time someone ran it they confirmed the same thing it seemed like this one injection of and we only published this a year ago but since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect so we don 't know what causes depression but we do know that stress is the initial trigger in eighty percent of cases and depression and ptsd are different diseases but this is something they share in common right it is traumatic stress like active combat or natural disasters or community violence or and not everyone that is exposed to stress and this ability to experience stress and be resilient and bounce back and not develop depression or ptsd and it varies between people and we have always thought of it as just sort of this passive property it 's the sort of akin to putting on armor we had accidentally discovered the first and that 's not like anything you see with so in immune vaccines it 's not the vaccine in your body that protects you it 's your own and you actually never get the infection and then you take say an antibiotic which cures it and those drugs are actually working to kill the bacteria and you 'll only feel better during the time in which you 're taking it which is why you have to keep taking it and ptsd here we have your stress exposure we only have palliative care which is often the length of your own life because it seems like they might have the potential to protect against stress and prevent mice from developing depression and post traumatic stress disorder also not all antidepressants are also and that had no we might be able to protect people who are predictably at risk against stress induced disorders like depression and ptsd so that 's first of disease was estimated at two point five trillion dollars and since they are chronic that cost is compounding and is therefore expected to rise up to six trillion dollars in just the next fifteen years as i mentioned before repurposing can be challenging because of our prior biases has another name ketamine it 's still used across the world as an anesthetic it 's used in children we use it on the battlefield it 's actually the drug of choice in a lot of developing nations because it doesn 't affect breathing it is on the world health organization list of most essential medicines ketamine as a paravaccine first it 'd be pretty easy for us to develop it but as is we have to compete with our functional fixedness and mental set that kind of interfere fortunately it 's not the only compound we have discovered that has these prophylactic they have to go through the entire fda approval process so if we wanted something sooner it 's available we could develop it for a fraction of the price and a fraction of the time but actually functional fixedness and mental set there 's a real which is policy regardless the idea itself is completely novel in psychiatry to use drugs to prevent mental illness as opposed to just treat it it is possible that twenty fifty one hundred years from now we will look back now at depression and ptsd the way we look back at but as a great scientist once said only a fool is sure of anything a wise man keeps on guessing"
