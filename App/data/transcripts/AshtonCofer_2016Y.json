  "transcript": "my mom was upstairs folding laundry my sister was in her room doing homework and i was in the basement playing video games and as i came upstairs to get something to drink i looked out the window and realized that there was something that i was supposed to be doing and this is what i saw this was my science project i immediately started yelling my mom was freaking out my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my sister started recording a snapchat video and in addition to a robotics so the idea for this project all started when a few months earlier a couple of my teammates took a trip to central america and saw beaches littered with styrofoam or expanded polystyrene foam and when they came back and told us about it we really started thinking about the ways in which we see styrofoam every day flat screen tv you end up with a block of styrofoam bigger than the tv itself drink a cup of coffee well those and where do all these items go after their one time use taking over five hundred years to degrade every year the us alone produces over two billion pounds of styrofoam filling up a staggering we have these ghost accumulations of styrofoam waste why can 't we just recycle them like many plastics well simply put recycled polystyrene is too expensive and potentially contaminated so there is very little market demand for styrofoam that has to be recycled and in fact many cities across the us have even passed ordinances that simply ban the production of many products containing polystyrene which includes disposable utensils packing peanuts takeout containers but what if we could keep using styrofoam while not having to suffer from the repercussions of having to dispose of it what if we could turn it into something else that 's actually useful what if we could make the impossible possible my team hypothesized that we could use the carbon that 's already in styrofoam to create activated carbon which is used in almost every water filter today so we started out by doing a variety of heating tests most of our samples vaporized into nothing or exploded inside expensive furnaces maybe it 's because we 're kids we don 't know any better we knew that if we were successful we would be helping the environment and making the world a better place so we kept trying and failing and trying but then it happened and at that moment the thing that had been impossible all of a sudden wasn 't it showed us that although we had many failures at the beginning were able to persevere through them to get the test results that we wanted solving two global problems with just one solution performing more tests to make it more effective and testing it sponsored by the us army as well as first global innovation awards sponsored by xprize and we were also honored with the scientific american innovator award from google science fair with catching my dad 's grill on fire and failing so many times that we almost quit it was well worth it when we look back at it now and we persevered when it looked like nothing that we did would work we learned that you can 't have success without a little so in the future don 't be afraid if your grill goes up in flames because you never know when your idea might just catch fire"
