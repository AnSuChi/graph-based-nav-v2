  "transcript": "and when i tell people that at a cocktail party they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face i try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate but i just want to talk to you a little bit about why i think that the job i have is actually a privilege okay and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work if that 's what you call it this thing whoops can we go back this is the owens valley radio observatory behind the sierra nevadas and in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight i was working there collecting data for my thesis now it 's kinda lonely it 's kinda tedious just collecting data so i would amuse myself by taking photos at night of the telescopes or even of myself because you and i remember reading that book and at three in the morning i was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas i was using to measure the the spins of galaxies could also be but it was that idea the fact that you could in fact prove that there 's somebody out there just using this same technology i took a job at the seti institute now i have to say that my memory is so it was true all right now the idea for doing this it wasn 't very old at the time that i made that photo the idea a young astronomer by the name of frank drake used this antenna in west virginia pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on e t actually he did but it turned out to be the u s air force which doesn 't count as extraterrestrial intelligence but drake 's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing and i 'll get back to that and but this is something that we 're using today to search for e t and the electronics gotten very much better too this is frank drake 's electronics in one thousand nine hundred and sixty this is the allen telescope array electronics today some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately one hundred trillion times better than they were in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one hundred trillion times better but something that 's not appreciated i have twelve of these we 're looking for a but in fact those of you who are still conscious and mathematically the rate of increase is exponential it 's exponentially improving now exponential is an overworked word you hear it on the media all the time they don 't really know what exponential means but this is exponential in fact card carrying member of the digerati knows that that 's moore 's law so this means that over the course of the next two dozen years we 'll be able how many of those star systems have planets you know so in fact this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of planets mercury or neptune neptune 's probably not very big in your life what fraction of these planets are actually suitable for life we don 't know the answer to that either but we will learn that answer this year thanks to nasa 's kepler space telescope the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand one in a hundred something like that well even taking the pessimistic estimate that it 's one in a thousand that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the earth just in our own galaxy keep that in mind there 's plenty of real estate plenty of real estate in the universe and because of the vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos i figure we 're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years and i feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you either we 're going to find e t in the next two dozen years or i 'll buy you a cup of coffee let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don 't think about and that is what happens suppose that what is the effect what 's the consequence now i might be at ground zero for this i happen to know what the consequence for me would be because we 've had false alarms this is one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and this is a photo i made at about three o 'clock in the morning in mountain view here when we were watching the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal that we thought this is the real deal all right and i kept waiting for the men in black to show up right i kept waiting for nobody called i was so nervous that i couldn 't sit down i just wandered wandered around taking photos like this one just for something to do well at nine thirty in the morning with my head down on my desk because i obviously hadn 't slept all night the media will be on it faster than a weasel on ball bearings it 's going to be fast you can be sure of that no secrecy but what about you what 's it going to do to you and not even very much in the short term i mean that would be a bit like asking chris columbus in one thousand four hundred and ninety one hey chris you know what happens if it turns out that there 's a continent between here and japan you 're sailing to what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case and i think chris would probably offer you some some answer that you might not have understood it 's going to be a and that means if you can understand anything that they 're going to say it 's conceivable i don 't know giving julius caesar english lessons and the key to the library of congress it would change his day all right that 's one thing another thing that 's for sure going to happen that we 're just another duck in a row we 're not the only kids on the block and i think that that 's philosophically a very profound thing to learn and that is if you find a signal coming from a more advanced society because they will be that will tell you something about our own possibilities that we 're not inevitably doomed because they survived their technology we could do it too normally when you look out into the universe you 're looking back in time all hazily but you can look into the future so those are all the sorts of things that would seti i think is important because it 's exploration and it 's not only exploration it 's comprehensible exploration gotta tell you i 'm always reading books about explorers i find exploration very interesting amundsen shackleton you see franklin down there scott all these guys it 's really nifty and you might say oh that 's kind of a frivolous opportunity but that 's not frivolous that 's not a frivolous activity you know most ants are and they 're the ones that wander off they 're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop you but those ants even though most of them get wiped out those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the i also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what i think is a critical lack in our society and that is the lack of science literacy the lack of the ability to even understand science now look a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country you 've heard about sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn 't approve of well homeopathy or that evolution is just you know sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs or you know evolution all that sort of thing or global warming these sorts of ideas don 't really have any validity that you can 't trust the scientists now we 've got to solve that problem because that 's a critically important problem suggest to you that seti obviously can 't solve the problem but it can address the problem and that 's the result of four hundred years of science i mean in the 18th century in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library 19th century if you had a basement lab you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home right because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up now you 've got to spend years in grad school and post doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are it 's hard there 's no doubt about it and in fact here 's an example the higgs boson finding the higgs boson ask the next ten people you see on the streets hey do you think it 's worthwhile to spend billions of swiss francs looking for the higgs boson and okay so that doesn 't get people interested in science because they can 't comprehend what it 's about it 's exciting because we 're naturally interested in other intelligent beings and i think that 's part of our hardwiring i mean we 're hardwired to be interested in you notice they make very few programs so we 're interested in these sorts of things it 's also kids this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science because seti involves all kinds of science obviously biology obviously astronomy but also geology also chemistry various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of we 're looking for e t and in fact it 's my policy even though i give a lot of talks to adults you give talks to adults and two days later they 're back where they were but if you give talks to kids you know you know read a book or a magazine or whatever they get interested in something now it 's my that kids get interested in something between the ages of eight and eleven you 've i remember when a guy came to our high school actually it was actually my junior high school i was in sixth grade and he gave some talk all i remember from it was one word electronics it was like dustin hoffman in the graduate but i remember electronics and so i got interested in electronics and you know i studied to get my ham license i was wiring up stuff here i am at about fifteen or something doing that sort of stuff okay that had a big effect on me so that 's my point that you can have a big effect on these kids this reminds me i don 't know a couple years ago i gave a talk at a school in palo alto where there were about a dozen 11 year olds that had come to this talk i had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour and i started there was a white board behind me and i started off by writing a one with twenty two zeroes the number of stars in the visible universe and this number is so big there 's not even a name for and he said well actually there is a name for it it 's a so i stopped giving the lecture all they wanted to do was ask questions you kids are smarter than the people i work with now laughter they didn 't even care about that what they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions previous generations couldn 't do this experiment at all and when i look in the mirror the facts are that i really don 't see myself what i see is the generation behind me these are some kids from the huff school fourth graders i talked there what two weeks ago something like that"
