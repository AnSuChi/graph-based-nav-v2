  "transcript": "the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war filled with cans of food and water hunker down and eat out of that barrel today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn 't look like this instead it looks like this if anything kills over ten million people in the next few decades it 's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war but we 've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic we 're not ready for the next epidemic lots of tough challenges i followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication the problem wasn 't that there was a system that didn 't work well enough the problem was that we didn 't have at all in fact there 's some pretty obvious seen what the disease was seen how far it had spread the case reports came in on paper it was very delayed before they were put online and they were we didn 't have a way of preparing people now and a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of there was no one there to look at treatment approaches processed it and put that plasma back in people to protect them so there was a lot that was missing and these things are really a global failure but not to do these things i talked about now in the movies it 's quite different there 's a group of handsome epidemiologists but that 's just pure hollywood the failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than ebola let 's look at the progression of ebola over this year there 's three reasons why it didn 't spread more the first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers if it had gotten into a lot more urban areas so next time we might not be so lucky you can have a virus the source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like ebola or it could be bioterrorism so there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse let 's look at a model like the spanish flu back in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen but in fact we have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here we have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines vaccines that fit for that pathogen and we need preparedness the best lessons i think on how to get prepared are again what we do for war for soldiers we have full time waiting to we have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers nato does a lot of war games to check are people well trained do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies so they are absolutely ready to go so those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic first we need strong health systems in poor countries kids can get all their vaccines but also where we 'll see the outbreak very early on and then we need to pair those medical so that we see where the holes are and it didn 't go so well so far the score is germs one but i 'm quite sure it 's very modest compared to the potential harm the world bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we 'd have millions and millions of deaths & d those things would reduce global health equity and make because time is not on our side we can be ready for the next epidemic"
