  "transcript": "it would be nice to be objective in life in many ways the problem is that we have these color tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations most of the beers will go into one place will basically not be able to distinguish them and the exception of course will be guinness for example we sold people pain medications some people we told them the medications were expensive some people we told them it was and of course we all know that in sports if you are a fan of a particular team you can 't help but see the game develop from the perspective so all of those are cases in which our preconceived notions and our expectations what happened in more so we asked two questions do people know what kind of level of inequality we have and then what level of inequality do we want to have and then i asked you to tell me how much wealth do you think is concentrated in each of those buckets the bottom forty percent take a second think about it and have a number usually we don 't think think for a second have a real number in your mind you have it okay here 's what lots of americans tell us they think that the bottom twenty percent has about two point nine percent of the wealth the next group you can see how this relates to what you thought now the bottom twenty percent has zero point one percent of the wealth the next group has three point nine and the richest group has so what we actually have and what we think we he had this notion of what 's a just society because if you 're wealthy you might want the wealthy to have more money the poor to have less if you 're poor you might want more equality but if you 're going to go into that society in every possible situation and you don 't know you have to consider all the aspects and rawls called this the veil of ignorance so fourteen percent of the wealth nobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample but we have at least as big a gap between what we think is right to what we think we have now we can ask these questions by the way not just about wealth we can ask it about other things as well and they gave us basically the same answer npr listeners and forbes readers very similar answers we even asked different departments of a university we went to harvard and we checked almost every department the similarity was astonishing i know some of you went to so you can see what people think is the ratio what is reality and you could say well it 's not that bad right the red and the yellow are not that different it 's hard to see there 's yellow and blue in there what about life expectancy what about life expectancy of infants how do we want this to be distributed what about education for young people and for older people and across all of those things what we learned was that people don 't like inequality of wealth we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency so what are some lessons from this we have two gaps we have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap and the knowledge gap is something that we think about how do we educate people how do we get people to think differently about inequality and the consequences of inequality in terms of health education jealousy crime rate and so on then we have the desirability gap how do we get people to think differently about what we really want you see the rawls takes our selfish motivation out of the picture how do we implement that to a higher degree on a more extensive and finally we also have an action gap how do we take these things and actually do something about it i think part of the answer is to think about people like young kids and babies that don 't have much agency because people seem to be more willing to do this to summarize i would say next time you go to drink beer or wine first of all think about what is it in your experience that is real thanks a lot"
