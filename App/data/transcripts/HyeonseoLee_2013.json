  "transcript": "grew up singing a song called nothing to envy and i was very proud in school we spent a lot of time but i thought my life in north korea was normal but one day in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five my mom brought home a letter from a coworker 's sister it read because we haven 't eaten for the past three weeks we are lying on the and our bodies are so weak we are waiting to die this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering i saw something terrible that to this day can 't erase from my memory because they were so focused on taking care of themselves power outages also became more and more frequent so everything around me was completely for the sea of lights in china just across the river from my home i always wondered why they had lights but we didn 't compared to neighbors which serves as a part of the border between north korea i saw dead bodies floating down the river but i only can but i only thought that i would be separated from my family for a short time i could have never imagined that it would take fourteen years to live together i had no idea what life was going to be like as a north korean since north korean refugees are considered in china as illegal migrants and i would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in north korea and brought to the police station for interrogation i was so scared me go it was a miracle but many can be caught by the chinese police and repatriated even though they were caught they were eventually released after heavy international pressure these north koreans were not so lucky koreans are caught in china and repatriated to north korea imprisoned or publicly executed it 's tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive even after learning a new language and getting a job their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant that 's why after ten years of hiding my identity i decided to risk going to south korea english was so in south korea so i had to start learning my third language also i realized there was a wide gap between north and south due to sixty seven years of division i even went through an identity crisis am i south korean or north korean where am i from who am i suddenly there was no country i could proudly call my own i made a plan i started studying for the university entrance exam i received a shocking phone call the north korean authorities intercepted some money that i sent to my family and as a punishment my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside they had to get out quickly so i started planning how to help them escape north koreans have to travel incredible distances on the i took a flight back to china and and since my family couldn 't speak chinese i had to guide them somehow through more than two thousand miles in china and then into southeast asia and we were almost caught several times one time our bus was stopped since my family couldn 't and i told him that these are deaf and dumb people that i was chaperoning but luckily he believed me we made it all the way to the border of laos but even after we got past the border my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing but soon after my family was arrested and jailed i did everything to get my family i went back and forth between the immigration office and the police out i lost all hope at that moment i heard one man 's voice ask me what 's wrong i was so surprised and with a dictionary i explained the situation and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other north koreans to get out of jail and i asked him why are you helping me i 'm not helping you he said i 'm helping the north korean people i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life the kind stranger symbolized new hope and he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community eventually after our long journey my family and i were reunited in south but getting to freedom is only half the battle and when they arrive in a new country they start with little or no money and more because many received so much help and inspiration in my life so i want to help give aspiring north koreans a thank you"
