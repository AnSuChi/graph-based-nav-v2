  "transcript": "the the the the the the the i 'm also the anderson invited me i 'm and the song that i just played was by josef hofmann it 's called kaleidoscope and hofmann is a polish pianist and composer of the late and he 's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time i have another piece that i 'd like to play for you it 's called abegg variations by robert schumann a german but he wrote that for his wife so actually if you listen carefully there are supposed to be five variations on this abegg theme it 's written around one thousand eight hundred and thirty four so even though it 's old i hope you 'll like it oh the the ok the ok the the ok me that this session is called sync and flow i was wondering what do i know that these geniuses don 't so i 'll talk about musical composition even though i don 't know where to start i think yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose what i do first i make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano like the abegg that you just heard i have to decide out of all the styles in music what kind of style do i want and this year i composed a romantic style so for inspiration i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers next i make the structure of the and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas because then you have to think laughter and then when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form solidified excuse me solidified form you 're supposed to actually polish the piece polish the details and then polish the overall performance of the composition i think that 's a craze among teens right now because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing it 's your character you want to decide who you want to draw and then you want to decide how are you going to draw the character like am i going to use one page am i going to draw it on the computer am i going to use a two page spread like and then and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need that 's polishing the because i know i 'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted so if i 'm trying to do homework and i don 't feel like it i 'll try to draw and then it 's like there 's too much on your mind you can 't focus on what you 're supposed to do and sometimes if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it you 'll get something out of it but it doesn 't come naturally and then that 's what i consider flow because that 's when everything clicks and you 're able to do anything you feel like you 're on top of your game and you can do anything you want i 'm not going to play my own composition today because although i did finish it it 's way too long one with each note of the musical alphabet and i 'd like someone to come up here and choose five to come up here and choose five and then i can make it into some sort of melody and i 'll improvise it would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose i 'm going to try to put that in some sort of order i 'm going to have a moment to think and i 'll try to make something out of it ok ok ok the the next song or the encore that i 'm going to play is called the the the"
