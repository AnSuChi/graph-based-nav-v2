  "transcript": "and when we say infidelity what exactly do we mean for the past ten years traveled the globe and worked extensively with hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity there is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple of their relationship their happiness and their very identity an affair so this talk in fact infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy so much so that this is the only commandment that is repeated twice in the bible and once just for thinking about it but who knows what 's really going on under the sheets there right because when it comes to sex the pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate but the pressure for women i mean many of you probably have said i am monogamous in all my relationships and we stop having sex with others everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat i 've been asked that question since i arrived at this conference but the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding staying secretly active on dating apps so because there is no universally agreed upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity estimates vary widely from twenty six percent but on top of it but just about the same amount of us will say that that 's exactly what we would do if we were having one and alchemy is the key word here because the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking so it 's never been easier and it 's never been more difficult to keep a secret and never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll ironically we used to turn to adultery but now that we seek love in now there are three ways that i think infidelity hurts differently today we have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs to be my greatest lover my best friend the best parent my i 'm the one and infidelity tells me i 'm not it is the ultimate betrayal infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love i thought i knew who you were who we were a violation of trust a crisis of identity can i ever trust you again he asks can i ever trust anyone again and this is also what my patient heather and heather is playing on his ipad with the boys when she sees a message appear on the screen can 't wait to see you strange she thinks we just saw each other and then another message can 't wait to hold you in my arms and heather realizes these are not for her she also tells me that her father and a little bit of lipstick on the collar heather and it made me think affairs in the digital age are death by a but then we have another paradox that we 're dealing with these days because of this romantic ideal and not because we have new desires today so heather she can 't talk to her so if we can divorce why do we still have affairs either there 's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you but millions of people can 't all be pathological the logic goes like this if you have everything you need at home what if there are things that even a good relationship can never provide what is it about the vast majority of people that i actually work with are not at all chronic they often are people who have actually been but for a glimmer of what and they are also an expression of longing and loss you will often find a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection for novelty for freedom for autonomy for sexual intensity a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy i 'm thinking about another patient of mine priya loves her husband and would never want to hurt the man she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard after hurricane sandy and with his truck and he 's quite the opposite of her but at forty seven priya 's affair is about the adolescence that she never had and her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaze of another and it isn 't so much that we 're looking for another person as much as we are looking now all over the world there is one word that people who have affairs always tell me and a friend that went too soon and bad news at the doctor because they raise these questions is this it is there more am i going on for another twenty five years like this and it has led me to think that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel people to cross the line and that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness in an antidote to death and contrary to what you may think desire to feel special keeps you wanting that which you can 't have now some of you probably think that affairs don 't happen in open but the fact is that it seems that even when we have the freedom to have other sexual partners we still seem to be lured by the power of the forbidden that if we do that which we are not supposed to do then we feel like we are really doing what we want to i 've also told quite a few of my patients that if they could bring into their relationships one tenth of the boldness the imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs they probably would never need to see me so how do we heal from an affair and others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity they 'll be able to turn this into a generative experience and i 'm actually thinking even more so for the deceived partner who will often say you think i didn 't want more but i 'm not the one who did it and they no longer have to uphold the status quo that may not have been working for them that well either 've noticed that a lot of couples in the immediate aftermath of an affair because of this new disorder that may actually lead to a new order will have depths of conversations with honesty and openness that they haven 't had in decades and partners who were sexually indifferent find themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious they don 't know where it 's coming from and make way for an entirely new kind of truth what are some of the specific things that couples can do we know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator acknowledges their wrongdoing so for the partner who had the affair for nick one but the truth is that i have noticed that quite a lot of people who have affairs may feel terribly guilty for hurting their partner he can relieve heather from the obsession and from having to make sure that the affair isn 't forgotten and that in itself begins to restore trust but for heather or deceived partners it is essential to do things that bring back self worth to surround oneself with love and with friends and activities that give back joy and meaning and identity how often is she better than me in bed and instead switch to what i call the investigative questions the ones that mine the meaning and the motives what did this affair mean for you what were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me what was it like for you when you came home what is it about us that you value are you pleased this is over and every couple will determine what the legacy of the affair will be but and they 're not going away and the dilemmas of love and desire they don 't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad and victim and perpetrator betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms there are many ways that we betray our partner with contempt with neglect indifference with violence and i know what you 're thinking she has a but because i think that good can come out the main question that i 've been asked since i arrived at this conference when i said i would talk growth and and so when a couple comes to me in the aftermath of an affair that has been revealed most of us are going to have two or three and some of us are going to do it with the same person thank you"
