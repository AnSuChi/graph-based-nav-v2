  "transcript": "and this group was no different except that this was a community of groundbreaking women who came together first to become teammates then friends and then family in the least likely of places on the special operations battlefield but by the fact that they were there at a time when women officially at least remained banned from ground combat and america had no idea they existed saying we need women to help us wage this war america would never kill its way to the end of its wars it argued needed more knowledge men could not talk to women because in a conservative and traditional society like afghanistan that would cause grave offense so you needed women soldiers out there that meant at this time in the war that the women who would be recruited to serve alongside army rangers and navy seals would be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent less than five percent so the call went out female soldiers become a part of history join special operations on the battlefield answered that call to serve and for them it was not about politics it was about serving with purpose and so the women who came to north carolina to compete for a spot on these teams which would put women landed and found very quickly a community the likes of which they had never seen full of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were and as driven to make a difference and what they found when they were there was that all of a sudden there were lots of people like them as one of them said it was like you looked around and realized there was more than one giraffe at the zoo a west point track star who always ran and road marched with no socks and had shoes whose smell proved it and when she found out that women couldn 't be she decided to become an intel officer she and then there was kate who played high school football all four years and she decided to stay for all the little girls who would come after her and put as cassie once said everything noble out of reach for girls and yet here was a chance to serve with the best of the best on a mission that mattered to but because of it and they would come back and watch a movie called they even wore a thing called spanx because as they found very quickly the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small and small where they should be big so lane an iraq war veteran you see her here on my left decided she was going to go on amazon and order a pair of spanx to her base so that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night including the shewee which was a tool that let you pee although it 's said to have had only a forty percent accuracy rate out there these women lived in the and and really like you could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies and these women brought that to this mission as well but being a soldier is what would prove themselves there there was the night amber went out on mission and in talking to the women of the house realized that there was a barricaded shooter lying in wait for the afghan and american forces who were waiting to enter the home explosives lay all the way between there and where they were about to head that night there was the night another one of their teammates proved herself to a decidedly skeptical team of seals when she found the intel item they were looking for wrapped up in a baby 's wet diaper and there was the night that isabel another one of their teammates found the things that they were looking for and received an impact award from the rangers who said that without her the things and the people they were looking for that night would never have been found that night and so many others they went out to prove themselves not only for one another but for everybody who would come and also for the men alongside whom they served we talk a lot about how behind every great man is a good woman and when they told him that he had to go train girls he had no idea what to expect these may well be our own tuskegee airmen at the heart of this team was the one person who everyone called called the best of us she was a she was someone who loved to make dinner for her husband her kent state rotc sweetheart who pushed her to be her best and to and she loved to be a soldier she was the person who if you needed an extra pair of boots or a home cooked dinner but let her character speak through action she was famous for taking the hard right over the easy wrong and she was also famous for walking up to a 15 foot rope climbing it using only her arms and then shuffling away and apologizing because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs as the rangers had trained them and some of them don 't first lieutenant ashley white was killed alongside two rangers christopher horns and kristoffer domeij her death threw this program built for the shadows into a very public spotlight because after all the ban on women in combat was still very much in place but to all her team of sisters and they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female in the united states army ashley 's mom is a teacher 's aide and a school bus driver who bakes cookies on the side she doesn 't remember much about that overwhelming set of days in which grief enormous grief but she does remember one moment a stranger with a child in her hand came up to her because i wanted her to know what a hero was and i wanted her to know that heroes could be women who would come after them"
