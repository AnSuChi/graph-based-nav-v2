  "transcript": "every day i listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives but there 's one story that keeps me awake at night a syrian refugee nineteen years old she was living a grinding existence in egypt working day wages her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back and the community that once welcomed them there and one day men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her because she was in love with a fellow syrian refugee and he said to doaa i will work you can study the promise of a new life but they knew to get to europe they had to risk their lives across the mediterranean sea putting their hands it was august that year and already two thousand people had died trying to cross the mediterranean but doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to northern europe and she thought maybe we can too and bassem paid his entire life savings two thousand five hundred dollars each to the smugglers it was a saturday morning when the call came and they were taken by five hundred of them crammed onto that boat three hundred below [ two hundred ] above there were syrians palestinians africans muslims and christians one hundred sandra little sandra six years old and masa eighteen months there were families on that boat crammed together shoulder to shoulder feet to feet doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest bassem holding her hand day two on the water they were sick with worry and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea day three i fear the boat is going to sink and bassem said to her please be patient we will make it to sweden we will get married and we will have a future they asked the captain when will we get there he said in sixteen hours we will reach the shores of italy they were weak and weary throwing the parents were terrified and they collectively refused to disembark and a half an hour later came back and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of and she heard how they yelled let the fish eat your flesh and they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank the three hundred people below deck were and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller but she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs thinking this is swimming it was one of those child 's rings that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas doaa climbed onto the ring her arms and her legs so he held her hand praying for rescue but when a day went by and no one came and doaa and bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off one man approached them nine months old malek he was holding onto a gas canister and he said to them i fear i am not going to survive i 'm too weak i don 't have the courage anymore and he handed little malek over to bassem and to doaa and they perched her onto the life ring and let me take a pause in this story right here millions of refugees are they can 't their homes their businesses their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed this is a unesco world heritage city in syria so people continue to flee into neighboring countries and we build refugee camps for them in the desert hundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these and thousands and thousands more millions live in towns and cities and the communities the neighboring countries that once welcomed them with open arms and hearts are overwhelmed there are simply not enough even rich european countries could never handle such an influx the syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders but over seven million people are on the run inside the country that means that over half the syrian population has been forced to flee back to those neighboring countries hosting so many and days have turned into months months into years a refugee 's stay is supposed to be temporary it was their second day and bassem was getting very weak and now it was doaa 's turn to say to bassem my love please hold on to hope to our future we will make it and he said i 'm sorry my love that i put you in this situation i have never loved anyone as much as i love you and he released himself into the water and doaa watched later that day a mother came up to with her small daughter masa this was the little girl i showed you in the picture earlier with the life vests her older sister sandra had just drowned and her mother knew she had to do everything i will not survive and then she went away and drowned so found herself and she tried her best to amuse them to sing to them to say words to them from the quran the bodies were bloating and turning black doaa probably looked on the ring with her two children a woman came on the fourth day and approached her and asked her to take another child when doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned she said to the sobbing child she just went away to find you water and food because she saw two planes crossing in the sky and she waved her arms but that and she said please god and it had become dark but finally the searchlights found her astonished to see a woman they pulled them onto the boat they got oxygen and blankets but doaa looked down and asked what of malek and they told her the little baby did not survive she drew her last breath in the boat 's clinic but doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat that little baby girl had been smiling only eleven people survived that wreck of the five hundred but that was only for one day and then then the news cycle moved on meanwhile in a pediatric hospital on crete little masa was on the edge of death she was really dehydrated her kidneys were failing her glucose levels were dangerously low the doctors did everything in their medical power to save them and the greek nurses never left her side holding her hugging her singing her words my colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in arabic amazingly and soon the greek press started reporting about the miracle who had survived four days in the water without food and offers to adopt her thin dehydrated an egyptian family took her into their home and soon word went around about and a phone number was published on facebook messages started coming in doaa do you know what happened to my brother my sister my parents my friends do you know if they survived one of those messages said i believe you saved my little niece masa and it had this photo this was from masa 's uncle a syrian refugee who had made it to sweden with his family and also masa 's older sister and until then she 's being cared and doaa well word went around about her survival too and the media wrote and still save another life but she wants to still go to sweden she wants to reunite with her family there she wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings away from egypt there as well and i believe she will succeed she wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight but i have to ask what if she didn 't have to take that risk why did she have to go through all that why is there no massive resettlement program for syrian refugees the victims of the worst war of our times the world did this for the vietnamese in the 1970s why not now and why the root question is so little being done to stop the wars the persecution and the poverty until these issues are resolved people will continue to take to the seas and to seek safety and what happens next well and i understand the public fears because there is something fundamental here and it is about our common humanity no person fleeing war or persecution should have to die crossing a sea to reach safety one thing is for sure that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are and no migrant would take that dangerous journey if and no one would put their life savings so on behalf of little masa and on behalf of doaa and of bassem and of those five hundred people who drowned with them can we make sure that they did not die in vain could we be inspired by what happened and take a stand thank you"
