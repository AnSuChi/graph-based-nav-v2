  "transcript": "or indeed into this theater 's foyer in about an hour 's time there is going to be food there waiting for us having magically come from somewhere but when you think that every day for a city the size of london enough food has to be produced eaten disposed of and that something similar has to happen every day for every city and as more of us move into cities more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me it 's soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil in order to feed us and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either as more of us move into cities more of us are eating meat so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals and given that it takes three times as much grain actually ten times as much grain to feed a human if it 's passed through an animal first that 's not a very efficient way of feeding us and it 's an escalating problem too and it 's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed so meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand and that 's going to pose an enormous problem six that 's a big problem and actually if we carry on as we are it 's a problem we 're very unlikely to be able to solve nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land although at the same time we 're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion we and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost we don 't actually value it and to end all a grim picture well to answer the slightly easier question first about ten thousand years ago i would say is the beginning of this process in the ancient near east known as the fertile crescent because as you can see it was crescent shaped and it was also that two extraordinary inventions agriculture and urbanism happened roughly in the same place and at the same time because because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was central food because it was the temples that organized the harvest gathered in the grain offered it to the gods and then offered the grain that the gods didn 't eat back to the people so if you like the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them but of course not all of them were that small had about a million citizens by the first century a d so how did a city like this feed itself the answer is what i call ancient food miles this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world because it was very difficult to transport food over roads which were you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one long drawn out militarized shopping spree really in fact i love the fact i just have to mention this rome in fact used to import oysters from london at one stage i think that 's extraordinary so rome shaped its hinterland which is coming in from the thames along the bottom of this map and the roads leading up from them to which was the main market were also grain markets and if you look at the name of one of those streets bread street you can tell what was going on there three hundred years ago operating on site here until the everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port this is another thing about food in cities once its roots into the city are established coming in and arriving at the city at the northwest which is why smithfield london 's very famous meat market was located up there poultry was coming in from east anglia and so on to the northeast i feel a bit like a weather woman doing this anyway and so the birds were coming in and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside that 's where they were sold which is why it 's called in fact if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age you can trace food coming in to it you can actually see how it was physically shaped by food both by reading and then ten years later everything changed this is an image of the great western in one thousand eight hundred and forty and as you can see some of the and this changes everything to start off with it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities really any size and shape in any place cities used to be constrained by geography and as you can see from these maps of london in the ninety years after the trains came it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot and so on to a large splurge that would be very very difficult to feed with anybody on foot either animals or people and really this marks the end of this process it 's the final emancipation and this is the kind of city that 's devoid of smell devoid of mess certainly devoid of people because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape to a box somewhere on the outskirts came back with a week 's worth of shopping and this really is the moment when our relationship both with food and cities changes completely here we have food that used to be the center the social core of the city at the periphery it used to be a social event buying and selling food now it 's anonymous or a little bit of an egg if you 're making a cake or something we don 't smell food to see if it 's okay to eat we just we throw it away one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they 've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder which is that of us and nature five hundred years ago it 's what thomas more was asking himself this is the frontispiece of his book utopia and it was a series of if that sounds remotely familiar a day 's walk from one another where everyone was basically and grew vegetables in their back gardens and ate communal meals together and so on and i think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of utopia even though more never framed it that way and here is another very famous utopian vision that of ebenezer howard the garden city same idea series of little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around joined to one another by railway and again food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision it even got built but nothing to do with this vision that howard had and that is the problem with these utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately it was a kind of joke so i 've come up with an we live in a world shaped by food and if we this is it 's food at the center of life at the center of family life being celebrated being enjoyed people taking time for it this is where food should be in our society but you can 't have scenes like this unless you have people like this by the way these can be who plan who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them we need these people we 're part of a network but because without that you can 't have this kind of place and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto it 's a greenhouse where kids get told all about food and growing their own food here is a plant called kevin or maybe it so sitopia for me is really a way of seeing it 's basically recognizing that sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere the trick is to join them up and if we do that we 're going to stop seeing cities as big metropolitan unproductive blobs like this but of course that 's not a great image either because we need not to be producing food like this anymore we need to be thinking more about permaculture which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing it 's a of the way food shapes our lives we can use food as a really powerful tool"
