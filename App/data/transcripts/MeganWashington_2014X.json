  "transcript": "know when i agreed to to do this whether i was expected to talk or to sing but when i was told that the i felt that i had to speak about something for a moment i have a it 's not the worst thing in the world i 'm fine i 'm not on fire i know that other people in the world have far worse things to to deal with but for me language and music are inextricably linked through it might seem curious given that i spend a lot of my life on the stage one would assume that i 'm comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here speaking to you guys the truth is that i 've spent my life up until this point and including this point living in mortal dread whole different thing i 've never really talked about it before so explicitly i think that that 's because i 've always lived in hope that when i was a grown up i wouldn 't have have one i sort of lived with this idea that when i 'm grown i 'll have learned to speak french and when i learn how to manage my money and when i 'm grown i won 't have a stutter and then i 'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything 's possible and you know so i can talk about it now because i 've reached this point where i mean pretty sure that i 'm grown now and i 'm an adult woman woman who spends her life as a so i might as well come clean about it there are some interesting angles to having a stutter for me the worst thing that can happen is my horror when i realized he thought i was making fun of forgotten their name when i hesitate before saying it and it is a very weird thing because proper nouns are the worst if i 'm going to use the word and i 'm coming up to the word and i can feel that i 'm going to stutter or something i can change the word to tomorrow or the day after tuesday or something else it 's clunky but you can get away with it because over time i 've developed this loophole method of using speech where right at the last minute you but with people 's names you can 't change them when i was singing a lot of jazz i worked a lot with a pianist whose name was steve as you can and when i got around to steve i 'd often find myself stuck so after a few instances of this steve happily became seve and we got through it that way i 've had a lot of therapy and a common form of treatment is to use this technique that 's called smooth speech which is where you almost sing everything that you say kindergarten and it makes you sound very serene like you 've had lots of valium i use it when i have to be on or when i have to do radio interviews when the economy of airtime is paramount i get through it that way for my but as an artist who feels that their work is is based solely on a platform of honesty and being it 's more than making nice it 's more than feeling known or understood it 's more than it 's not about mythology or mythologizing myself to you somehow through some miraculous it 's impossible to stutter when you sing and when i was younger that was a method of treatment that worked very well for me singing so i did it a lot and that 's why i 'm here today time when i feel fluent it is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what i intended so i know that this is a ted talk but now i 'm going to this is a song that i wrote last year thank you very much the"
