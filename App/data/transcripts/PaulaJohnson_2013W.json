  "transcript": "some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother mamar in our four family home in brooklyn new york her apartment was an oasis it was a place where i could sneak a cup of coffee which was really warm milk with just touch of caffeine she loved life she saved her pennies and she traveled to europe and i remember poring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music and then when i was eight and she was sixty something changed she no longer worked or traveled she no longer danced there were no more coffee times and my father who worked at night would spend every afternoon with her just to make sure she ate her care became now many of you will recognize her symptoms my grandmother had depression a deep and back then so little was known about depression but even today fifty years later there 's still so much more to learn we know that women are seventy percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms pain and anxiety compared with men and these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression so it 's my grandmother 's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest we know that every cell has a sex now that 's a term coined by the institute of and what it means is that men and women are different down to the cellular and molecular levels it means that we 're different across all of our organs from our brains to our hearts our lungs our joints now it was only twenty years ago that we hardly had any data on women 's health beyond our reproductive functions and what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities be included in clinical trials that were funded by the national institutes of health and in many ways the law has worked and we 're leaving it to chance in two ways the first is that there is so much more to learn and we 're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences and the second is that we aren 't taking what we have learned and routinely applying it in clinical care we are to share with you three examples of where sex differences have impacted the health of women and where we need to do more linda is a who had a stent placed in one of the arteries going to her heart when she had recurring linda 's symptoms continued she had to stop working and that 's when she found us but we needed another test and what we found was that linda 's disease didn 't look like the typical male the typical male disease looks like this there 's a discrete blockage or stenosis and it 's harder to see the gold standard test wasn 't gold now linda but for too many women that 's not the case but it 's all too often that these sex what about treatment a landmark study that was published two years ago asked the very important question and what they found out was that of those that were tossed out the money had been spent and we didn 't learn how women fared and these studies could not contribute one iota to the very very important question i want to introduce you to hortense my godmother and somebody you may recognize dana christopher reeve 's wife all three women have something very important in common all three all three sadly dana and hung wei died of their disease today what we know is that women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men who are nonsmokers now interestingly when women are diagnosed with lung cancer their survival tends to be better than that of men now here are some clues our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor cells of both women and men and when these genes are but it 's findings like this that may provide hope and may provide an opportunity now let me share with you an example of when we do consider sex differences it can drive the science and what they found was that the genetic mutations that the drug targeted were far more common in women and what this has led to is a more personalized approach to the treatment of lung cancer that also includes sex this is what we can accomplish take a look at the death rate from breast cancer over time now let 's look at the dollars invested in breast cancer these are the dollars invested per death and the dollars invested in lung cancer now it 's clear that our investment in breast so let 's go back to depression our investigators have found and when you put men and women in a functional mri scanner that 's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it 's activated so you put them in the scanner and you expose them to stress and it 's findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why but even though we know that these differences occur percent of the brain research that begins in animals is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified so i think we have to ask and this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge of being able to we know that these differences are often overlooked we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum women 's health is an equal rights issue as important and it 's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine so imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research or if we analyzed our data by sex people often ask me what can i do and here 's what i suggest first i suggest that you think about women 's health in the same way that you think and care about other causes that are important to you and equally as important that as a woman you have to ask your doctor and the doctors who are caring for those who you love and this is so whether it be a mother a daughter a sister a friend or a grandmother it was my grandmother 's suffering that inspired my work to improve the health of that 's her legacy our legacy can be to improve the health of women for this generation and for generations to come"
