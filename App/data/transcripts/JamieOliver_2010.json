  "transcript": "in the next eighteen minutes when i do our chat four americans that are alive will be dead through the food that they eat from essex in england and for the last seven years i 've worked fairly tirelessly to i don 't have expensive equipment or medicine i use information education i profoundly believe that the power of food has we have an awful awful this is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world can i please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today put your hands up we the adults of the last four generations have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we 've built around them two thirds you lot you 're all right but we 'll get you eventually don 't worry homicide you name cnn look at homicide at the bottom for god 's sake right every single one of those in the red any doctor any specialist will this is a global problem it england is right behind you as usual all have massive problems of obesity and bad health obesity costs you americans ten percent three hundred billion dollars a year let 's be honest guys you haven 't got that cash i came here to start a food revolution that i so profoundly believe in we need it the time is now now is the time when it 's ripe i went to west virginia the most unhealthy state in america or it was last year we 've got a new one this year but we 'll work on that next season beautiful town i wanted to put heart and soul and people your public around the statistics that we 've become i want to show a picture she 's got six years to live she 's the third generation of americans that hasn 't grown up within a food environment where they 've been taught to cook at home or or her mom or her mom 's mom she has six years to live stacy does her best but she 's she 's obese before she even gets to primary died of obesity obesity and diet related disease doesn 't just hurt the people that have it it 's all of their friends families brothers sisters he 's at the sharp this is preventable waste of life by the way this is what they get buried in we 're not geared up to do this can 't even get them out the door and i 'm being serious can 't even get them there forklift ok this is our landscape of food i need you to understand it you 've probably heard all this before what 's happened that 's ripped the heart out of this country let 's be frank powerful powers in this country big companies thirty years ago most of the food was largely local and largely fresh now it 's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives labeling is a massive problem the labeling in this country is a disgrace the industry wants to self police themselves what in this kind of climate they don 't deserve it how can you say something is low fat when it 's full of so much sugar home the biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on we kind of have to look at it i want to show you a situation that is very normal right now the edwards family i want my kids to succeed in life and this isn 't going to get them there but i 'm killing them school what is school who invented it what 's the purpose of school school was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative do wonderful things make us earn a living etc etc you know it but we haven 't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of america school food is something that most kids thirty one million a day actually more than often breakfast and lunch one so you could say that school food is quite important really judging the circumstances which i 'm sure you 're waiting for i need to say one thing and it 's so important the lunch ladies the lunch cooks of america i offer myself as their ambassador i 'm not slagging them off they 're doing the best they can do there 's not enough or any and a only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit there 's not enough fresh food in there at all you know the amount of additives pizza for breakfast they don 't even get get crockery knives and forks no they 're too dangerous it 's pizzas it 's all of that stuff ten percent of what we spend on health care as i said earlier is on obesity and it 's going to double we don 't teach kids about food and this is this is a little clip from an elementary school which is very common immediately you get a really clear sense of do the kids know anything about where food comes from period i want to tell you about something that kind of kind of epitomizes the trouble that we 're in guys ok i want to talk about something so basic as milk and most kids do but milk ain 't good enough anymore yeah obviously now that 's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they 'll eat more as well do you know what i mean okay there 's sugar in everything i know the ins and outs of those 's in everything even the milk hasn 't escaped we 've got one kid here the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar just from milk any judge in the whole world and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse that 's my belief if i came up here and i wish i could come up here today and hang a cure for aids or cancer you 'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me it 's very very preventable it cannot just come from one source to you know you 're going to live longer all of that stuff it will look different ok supermarkets where else do you shop so religiously week in week out how much money do you spend in your tasty seasonal the big brands you know the food brands need to put food education at the heart of their businesses fast food with the fast food industry i 've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food basically they 've weaned us on to these hits of sugar and everyone loves them but we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry and over a five six labeling i said earlier is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted they need to be cooked proper fresh food there needs to be a new standard of fresh proper food for your children it 's profoundly important that every single american child leaves school knowing how to cook ten recipes that will save their life life skills young parents and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of if you can cook time doesn 't matter it 's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff the staff are the moms and dads of i think she 'd be quite happy if corporate america could start feeding their staff properly but the home needs to start passing on cooking again for sure but it 's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something huntington where i onto the fresh food real tangible change there is plenty of wonderful things going on identify them and allow businesses of america need to support mrs obama to do the things that she wants to do and and i believe truly it 's incredibly important yeah when i was in huntington trying to get a few things to work when they i had a magic wand what would i do and i thought you know what i 'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in america so my wish bit slow my wish is for you to help a strong sustainable movement to educate every child about food to inspire families to cook to empower people everywhere to fight obesity"
