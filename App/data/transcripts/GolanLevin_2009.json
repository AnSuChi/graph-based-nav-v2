  "transcript": "but i still fall into this weird crack where people don 't seem to understand me and we can 't imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art and they still haven 't and lest you think that you all as the digerati are more enlightened i went to the apple i got productivity i got sports and somehow the that one would want to make art for the iphone which i think artists are obliged to do is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have in my own case i 'm an artist and i 'm really expanding the vocabulary of human action and basically empowering people through interactivity i want people to discover themselves as actors as creative actors by having interactive experiences a lot of my work is about trying to get away from this this a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine and when i say desktop i don 't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk if you look carefully you can even see a hint of the apple menu up here in the upper left where the virtual world has literally so this is as joy mountford once said the mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through and not necessarily utilitarian ones so i write software and that 's how i do it and a lot of my experiences because this is in some sense the first way that people discover their own potential as actors and discover their own agency by saying who is that person in the mirror oh it 's actually me and so to give an example and it allows people to explore the negative shapes so as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth or with each other so again people discover so in addition which is an immensely expressive system for us vocalizing song is one of our oldest ways of of making ourselves and he said one of them is called maluma is on which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have and so whereas dr oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia where they hear colors or taste shapes and things like this phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent it 's about mappings and the phonemes that we 're able to speak with so seventy years on there 's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which you know l m and b are more associated with shapes that look like this and p t and k are perhaps more associated with shapes like this and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically a relative mapping between and as you do you see the shadows of your own speech and they sort of fly away out of your head speech recognition system is able to recognize what you 're saying so let 's bring up a video of that okay and he is a world expert in performing the ursonate which is it 's almost impossible to perform but jaap is one of the world experts in performing it and in this project we 've developed a form of intelligent real time subtitles so these are our live subtitles that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of the ursonate fortunately jaap does very well and it is delivering that text at the same time as jaap is all the text you 're going to see is real time generated by the computer visualizing what he 's doing with his voice here you can see the set up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him because usually someone making them afterwards and then a bunch of people who were what 's the big deal i see subtitles all the time on television you know another thing that i 've been really interested in most recently is the use of the the eyes or the gaze in terms of how people relate to each other it 's a really profound amount of nonverbal information that 's communicated with the eyes so there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there and so i 've been with a variety of different projects to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes and basically to ask the questions what if art was aware that we were looking at it in the first one which i 'm going to show you it 's a piece of interactive software in which if we read this little circle the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer the idea is that it 's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed so let me just switch over so we can do the live demo so let 's run this and see if it works and i can hello okay and no matter where i am what 's really going on here is that it 's an eye tracking system that tries to locate my eyes and if i get really far away but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this this laptop then you 'll see these nice crisp eyes you where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be and you can see just once again how it 's sort of finding my eyes and and doing its best to estimate when it 's blinking alright let 's leave that so that 's this last couple pieces i 'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics for me new for me it 's called and i 'm going to show a video of the older version of it which is just a minute long in response to one 's own blinks so it blinks one second after you do this is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials just one eye looking at you and eliminating everything else about a face but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of as an element and at the same time it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar away if you look at it too long because it gets shy or things like that so the last project i 'm going to show is this new one called snout it 's an eight foot snout with a googly eye and inside it 's got an 800 pound robot arm that i borrowed a friend it helps to have good friends i 'm at carnegie mellon we 've got a great robotics institute there i 'd like to show you thing called snout which is the the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it 's continually surprised to see you its other name is doubletaker taker of doubles it 's always kind of doing a double take what and the idea is basically can it look at you and and make you feel as if like and got a computer vision system and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most up there is the skeleton which is actually what it 's trying to do but also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it this language is communicating that it is surprised to see you and it 's interested in looking at you thank you very much that 's all i 've got for today and i 'm really happy to be here"
