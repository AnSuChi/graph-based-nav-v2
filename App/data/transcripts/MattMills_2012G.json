  "transcript": "so wouldn 't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of of knowledge and experiences and ideas well so the best way of explaining it is to just show it what you can see over here is tamara who is holding my phone that 's now plugged in so let me start with this what we have here is a painting of the great and it 's just a normal image but if we now switch inputs over to the phone running our technology and when she points at this image something magical happens no trickery here and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does it 's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly the thing that 's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself so a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it 's printed and here is this morning 's newspaper and we have some wimbledon news which is now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin voice to the grass and it 's very important that you adapt and you you have to be flexible you have to be willing to change direction at a split second and she does all that she 's won this title mm and that linking of the digital content to something that 's physical is what we call an aura and i 'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible so that everyone hereunderstands but nonetheless here is the device so now what i and then voice congratulations you have now completed setup and they work in our offices and i 've got a lovely picture of them here they couldn 't all be on stage but we 're going to bring their aura to the stage so here they are they 're not very animated this was the fourth take i 'm told and that means that i can now take 3d models and place them in the world around me so i have one over here because effectively this technology allows you to see the world through someone 's eyes and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world so we have teachers who 've tagged up textbooks teachers who 've tagged up school classrooms and a great example of this and we 're now going to play it and actually i 'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now so as sort of i 'm told it 's called a stadium wave so we 're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three and go over to here go audience whooooooo mm fellows are really good at that and what tamara 's going to do is is tag so that i can remember it forever now we have lots of people who are doing this already and we 've talked a little bit about the educational side on the emotional side we have people who 've done things like send postcards and christmas cards back to their family with with little messages on them we have people who have so that if you 're stuck and you want find out more you can point and discover the information we 're all very very familiar with the internet because and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us it 's completely free to download this application if you have a good wi fi connection or 3g this process is very very quick oh there we are we can save it now and the great thing is if you 're a professional user to what we 've just used to create this demonstration the only difference is that you 've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content you now ready"
