  "transcript": "a documentary by jacques cousteau 'or and an oscar award this film was called le monde du silence or the silent the premise of the title was that the underwater world was a quiet world although the sounds are inaudible above water depending on where you are and the time of year the underwater soundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or and marine mammals all use sound they use sound to study their habitat to keep in communication with each other to navigate to detect predators and prey they also use sound by listening to know something about their environment take for an example the arctic and despite this especially as days lengthen and spring comes to me the arctic really embodies this disconnect between what we see on the surface and what 's going on underwater you can look out across the ice all white and blue and cold and see nothing but if you could hear underwater the sounds you would hear would at first amaze and then delight you your ears are telling you that out there there walrus and bearded seals the ice too makes sounds it screeches and cracks and pops and groans as it collides and rubs when temperature or currents or winds change and under one hundred percent sea ice in the dead of winter bowhead whales are singing and you would never expect that because but not all our sense of sight is how we navigate our world where chemical cues and light transmit poorly sound is the sense by which they see and sound transmits very well underwater much better than it does in air so signals can be heard over great distances although they spend most of their so they might listen for thin ice or no ice or listen for echoes off nearby ice arctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater soundscape in the and there are no big temperature shifts or current changes conducting a completely uncontrolled experiment with our planet over the past thirty years areas of the arctic have seen decreases in seasonal sea ice from anywhere from six weeks this decrease in sea ice is sometimes referred to but the age and the width of ice is and changing prey availability for marine birds and mammals climate change and decreases in sea ice are also altering the underwater soundscape of the arctic and we record ambient noise the noise all around us and the soundscape describes the different contributors to this noise field we are hearing on our hydrophones are the very real sounds of climate change we are hearing these changes from three fronts from the air from the water wind on water creates waves these waves make bubbles the bubbles break and when they do they make noise and this noise is like a hiss or a static in the background because the ice acts as a buffer between the atmosphere and the water this is one of the reasons that the arctic can have very low ambient noise levels but not only is the arctic now open but the number of storms and the intensity of storms in the arctic has been increasing all of this is raising noise levels in a previously quiet ocean second water subarctic species are and taking advantage of the new habitat that is created by more open water now arctic whales like this bowhead and may in fact be excluding animals from the ice and we don 't know what this means will there be competition for food between arctic and subarctic animals might these subarctic species introduce diseases or parasites into the arctic and what are the new sounds that they are producing i mean people just this past summer a massive cruise ship made its way through the northwest passage the once mythical route between europe and the pacific decreases in sea ice have allowed humans to occupy the arctic more often the potential for commercial shipping as well as increased tourism and we now know that ship noise increases levels of stress hormones in whales and can disrupt feeding behavior air guns which produce loud changed the swimming and vocal behavior of whales and all of these sound sources are decreasing the acoustic space which arctic marine mammals can communicate now and these are sounds that are vital to their very survival these new sounds are loud and they 're alien remember but the acoustic habitat is it 's as if we 've plucked these animals up from the quiet countryside and dropped them into a big city in the middle of rush hour and they can 't escape it but we can work on local solutions to reducing human caused underwater because a slower ship is a quieter ship we can restrict access in seasons and regions that are important for mating or feeding or migrating we can get smarter about quieting ships and find better ways to explore the ocean but ultimately we humans have to do the hard work of reversing or at the very least so let 's return to this idea of a silent world underwater it 's entirely possible that many of the whales swimming in the arctic today especially long lived species like the bowhead whale that the inuits say can live two human lives it 's possible that these whales were alive in perhaps it really was the silent world"
