  "transcript": "growing up in taiwan one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty the shape and the form of chinese characters ever since then i was fascinated by this incredible language i 've been wondering if i can break down this wall so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so i started thinking about how a new fast method of learning chinese might be useful since we only have five minutes it 's better that we have a fast and simpler way a chinese scholar would understand twenty thousand characters you only need one thousand to understand the top two hundred will allow you to comprehend forty percent of basic literature open your mouth as this is a person going for a walk person if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides as if she was yelling frantically the sun symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west i call these eight characters radicals they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters a person if someone walks behind that three is a crowd if a person stretched their arms wide this person is saying it was this big three trees together put a mouth on the top of the tree that 's idiot easy to remember since a talking tree is pretty idiotic remember fire two set the fire underneath the two trees it 's burning the sun is coming up above the horizon sunrise asking questions knock knock is anyone home evading they have an argument be careful it 's adultery thirty two so with very little effort you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters which is the same as a chinese it 's a volcano so a sun we build japan a person behind japan what do we get a the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other nowadays exile has turned into getting out a mouth which tells you where to get out thank you"
