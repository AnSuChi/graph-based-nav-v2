  "transcript": "about today you but i do hope to take you to some places you 've never been to before actually one indication is that little boy on my husband 's shoulders has just graduated from high school laughter but this is tiananmen square many of you have been there it 's not the real china let me take you to the real china this is in the dabian mountains in the remote part she lives with her parents her two brothers and her great aunt they have a hut that has no electricity no running water and they share this great splendor with a very large pig dai manju was in sixth grade when her parents said why would we waste this money on you turns out that dai manju was the she still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and we got a flood of donations mostly 13 dollar checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts we got a money transfer for $ ten thousand we turned the money over to that man there the principal of the school he was delighted he thought so dai manju basically finished out she scouted for jobs down in guangdong province in the south she found a job she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends she sent money back to her family they built what we saw was a natural experiment it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls ' education and over the years as we followed dai manju we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle she not only changed her own dynamic she changed her she changed her family her village the village became and that brings me to my first major of two tenets of half the sky and that is that the was totalitarianism the cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender she 's exaggerating well let me ask you this question let me take a poll how many of you think there are more males in the world hands up please there are true enough in europe and the west when women and and men have equal access to food and health care there are more women we live in fact demographers have shown that there are anywhere between sixty million and one hundred million missing females in the current population in the last half century sometimes it 's also because of the sonogram girls get aborted before they 're even born the entire center was filled with girls like her what 's remarkable is that her brothers in the same family were totally fine in india in the first year of life from zero to one boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast and the breast shows the second tenet of half the sky is that let 's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all and just on a purely practical level we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate girls and to bring women into the formal labor force there are three reasons why this is the case for one overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty and you know when you educate a boy his family tends to have fewer kids but only slightly when you educate a the second reason is it has to do with spending it 's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty which is that not only do but also the income that they take in they don 't spend it very wisely and unfortunately most of that spending is done by men so research has shown if you look at people who live under two dollars a day one metric of of poverty two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here in education sugary drinks and prostitution and festivals if you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket you would have a the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution not the problem it 's a waste of resources if you don 't use someone like dai manju bill gates put it very well when he was traveling through saudi arabia he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves however two thirds of the way there was a barrier on this side was men and then the barrier and this side was women and someone from this side of the room got up and said we have here as our goal in saudi arabia to be one of the top ten countries when it comes to technology do you think we 'll make it so bill gates as he was staring out at the audience he said if you 're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country there is no way you will get anywhere near the top ten so here is bill of arabia so what would some of the specific challenges look like i would say on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking and i 'll just say two things about this the slavery at the peak of the slave trade in there were about eighty thousand slaves transported from africa to the new world modern slavery according to state department rough statistics there are about eight hundred thousand ten times the number which is a substantial portion if you look at another factor another contrast a slave back then is worth about $ forty thousand in today 's money there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand we don 't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed the second item on the agenda is this part of the world is a wonderful event in niger one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth around the world one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth but these women have three strikes against them they are poor they are rural for every woman who does die there are twenty who survive and the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula it 's she lives in ethiopia she was married against her will at age thirteen she and she ended up having obstructed labor and she ended up with a fistula so that meant she was incontinent she couldn 't control her wastes in a word she stank the villagers thought she was they ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night she fought off the hyenas with that stick and the next morning she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary she would be saved because she had some damage to her nerves she crawled all the way thirty miles to that doorstep and and they made her a nurse thousands of women she has become part of the solution not the problem she 's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle let me talk about some of the solutions and there are predictable solutions she tends to get married later and those kids that she does have she educates them in a more enlightened fashion it can be transformative she lives in a small village outside lahore pakistan and at the time she was miserable she was beaten every single day by her husband who was unemployed he was kind of a gambler in law told her son i think you 'd better get a second wife saima 's not going to produce you a son this at the time there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a and they kept asking for more and then when she which brings me to the final element which is education larry summers when he was chief economist at the world bank once said that it may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls ' education let me tell you about beatrice biira beatrice was living in uganda near the congo border and like dai manju she didn 't go to she had never been to school not to a lick one day her parents again said why should we spend the money on her she 's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth well it just so happens at that time there was a group in connecticut called the niantic community church group in connecticut they made a donation to an organization based in arkansas called heifer international heifer sent two goats to africa and that goat had twins the twins started producing milk they sold the milk for cash the cash started accumulating we 've got enough money let 's send beatrice to school so at nine years of age beatrice started in first grade after all she 'd never been to a lick of school with a six year old no matter she was just she rocketed to the top of her class she stayed at the top of her class she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village ever to come to the united states on scholarship she graduated from connecticut college she said i am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat and that goat was $ one hundred and twenty so you see how transformative little bits of help can be but i want to give you a reality check look u s helping people is not easy and there have been books that have criticized u s aid there 's bill easterly 's book there 's a book called dead aid people say how half of all water well projects a year later are failed when i was in zimbabwe we were touring a place with the village chief he wanted to raise money for a secondary school and there was some construction a few yards away and i said what 's that he sort of mumbled out that it 's a failed irrigation project a few yards away was a failed chicken coop one year all the chickens died and no one wanted to put the chickens in there it but we think that you don 't through the baby out with the bathwater you actually we can all help create a movement and a movement of men and women is what 's needed to bring about social change change that will address this great moral challenge so then i ask what 's in it for you you 're probably asking that why should you care i will just leave you with two things one is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of which most of us all of us here in this room do research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness one of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself it 's an anecdote that i 'll leave you with and that is the story of an aid worker in darfur seeing things that no human being should see and and she saw something that made her break down in tears what that was and she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted where we not only and she realized that with that great fortune and so and so the question becomes how do we discharge that responsibility feel happier and help save the world thank you very much"
