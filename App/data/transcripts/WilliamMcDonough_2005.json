  "transcript": "the canary in the mine wasn 't and so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared this is a rubber duck it comes in california with a warning this product contains chemicals known by the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm this is a bird what kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children i think we have a someone heard the six hours of talk that i gave and sent me this as a thank you note we realize that design is a signal of intention but it also has to occur within a world of affairs in that was one sentence henry james would be proud this is i put it down at the bottom but that was extemporaneous obviously the fundamental issue is that for me design is the first signal of human intentions so what are our intentions and what would our intentions be if we wake up in the morning we have designs on the world well what would our intention be as a species now that we 're the dominant species and it 's not just stewardship and dominion debate because really dominion is is implicit in stewardship because how could you dominate something you had killed and stewardship 's implicit in dominion because you can 't be steward of something if you can 't dominate it so the question is what is the first question for designers now as guardians let 's say the state for example which reserves the right to kill the right to be duplicitous and so on to secure local societies create world peace commerce on the other hand is relatively quick essentially creative highly effective and and fundamentally honest because we can 't exchange so we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work but the question we bring to it is how do we love all the children and so we start our designs with that question because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy i didn 't intend to cause global warming on the way here and we say that 's not part of my plan then we realize it 's part of our de and i was at the white house for president bush meeting with every federal department and agency and i pointed out that they appear to have no plan if the end game is global warming they 're doing great if the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the clean air act then i see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as brain death for all no child left behind so so if if you don 't have an endgame of something delightful then you 're just moving chess pieces around if you don 't know you 're taking the king so perhaps we could develop a strategy of change which requires humility and in my business as an architect 's unfortunate the word humility and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph since the fountainhead so reflect on this it took us five thousand years to put wheels on our luggage so as kevin kelly pointed out there is no endgame there is an infinite and so we call it cradle to cradle this is what i presented to the white house period what don 't you like about this which part of this don 't you like so we realized we want full diversity even though it can be difficult to remember what de gaulle said when asked what it was like to be president of france he said what do you think it 's like trying to run a country with four hundred kinds of cheese but at the same time we realize that our products are not safe and healthy so we 've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million this is a baby blanket by pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of alzheimer 's later in life ourselves what is justice and is justice blind or is justice blindness and at what point did that uniform turn from white to black water has been declared a human right by the united nations air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes is there anybody here who doesn 't breathe clean soil is a critical problem the nitrification the dead zones in the gulf of mexico a fundamental issue that 's not being addressed they asked him when will we see the end of the age of oil i don 't know if you remember his answer but it was the stone age didn 't end because we ran out of stones we see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don 't we see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect this is a hospital monitor from los angeles sent to china this woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous which is from copper on the other hand we see great signs of hope here 's dr we see in our material flows that car steels don 't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings bismuth antimony copper and so on they become building steel on the other hand company in the world we 've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable down to the parts per million landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for forty centuries you can 't farm the same piece of ground for forty centuries without understanding nutrient flow among the first growth and big growth my grandfather had been a lumberjack in the olympics so i have a lot of tree karma i am working off i went to yale for graduate school affectionately known in our business as brutalism if we look at the world of architecture we see with tower for berlin and the windows are all closed and with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use this is actually a vertical gas chamber when i went to yale we had the first energy crisis and i was designing the first solar heated house in ireland as a student which i then built which would give you a sense of my ambition and richard meier who was one of my teachers kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism and he would say bill you 've got to understand solar energy has nothing to do with architecture we did the first so called green office in america for environmental defense we started asking manufacturers what were in their materials so and yet noaa has now shown us for example you see that little blue thing above hawaii that 's the pacific gyre it was recently dragged for plankton by scientists and they found six times as much plastic as plankton when asked they said it 's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn 't flush something as elegant as a tree imagine this design assignment design something that makes oxygen sequesters carbon fixes nitrogen distills water accrues solar energy as fuel makes complex sugars and food creates microclimates changes colors with the seasons and we 're looking at the same criteria as most people you know can i afford it does it work do i like it we 're adding the jeffersonian agenda and i come from liberty and the pursuit of happiness we look at the word competition i 'm sure most of you 've used it you know so we 've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of of cooperating in order to get fit together and the chinese government has now i work with the chinese government now has has taken this up we 're also looking at survival of the fittest not in just competition now most environmentalists don 't say growth is good because in our lexicon asphalt is two words assigning blame but if we look at asphalt as our growth then we realize that all we 're doing is destroying the planetary 's fundamental underlying operating system so when we see e we see energy as physics chemistry as mass and all of a sudden you get this biology and we have plenty of energy so we 'll solve that problem but the biology problem 's tricky because as we as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge we will never be able to recover that and as francis crick pointed out nine years after discovering dna with mr watson that life itself so we 're asking for human artifice to become a living thing and we want growth we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals then the question becomes not growth or no growth but what do you want to grow we want to grow the things that we might enjoy and someday the fda will allow us to make french cheese so therefore we have these two metabolisms and i worked with a german chemist michael braungart and we 've identified the two fundamental metabolisms the biological one i 'm sure you understand but also the technical one where we take materials and put them into closed cycles we call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition biological nutrition so we need materials in closed cycles but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer birth defects mutagenic effects disruption of our immune systems biodegradation persistence heavy metal content knowledge of how we 're making them and their production and so on our first product was a textile where we analyzed thousand chemicals in the textile industry using those intellectual filters we eliminated [ seven thousand nine hundred and sixty two ] we were left with thirty eight chemicals so designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the because when we asked most companies we work with about a trillion dollars and where does it go customers so we need some help there so the biological biotechnical nutrients the model u for ford motor a cradle to cradle car concept car shoes for nike where the uppers are polyesters infinitely recyclable the bottoms are are wear your old shoes in your new shoes out there is no finish line the idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever some of the materials go back to soil it 's all solar powered here 's a building at oberlin college we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and this is our project for ford motor company it 's the revitalization of the river rouge in dearborn this is obviously a color photograph these are our tools these are how we sold it to ford we saved ford thirty five million dollars doing it this way which is the equivalent of the ford taurus at a four percent margin of an order for nine hundred million dollars worth of cars and this is the first species to arrive they showed up in five days and we now auto workers learning bird songs on the internet we 're developing now protocols for cities that 's the home of technical nutrients the country the home of biological and putting them together and so i will finish by showing you a new city we 're designing for the chinese government we 're doing twelve cities for china right now based on cradle to cradle our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for four hundred million people in twelve years we did a mass energy balance if they use brick they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal they we signed a memorandum memorandum of understanding here 's madam deng nan deng xiaoping 's daughter for china to adopt cradle to cradle because if they toxify themselves being the lowest cost producer send it to the lowest cost distribution we don 't normally do green fields but this one and they brought us in and said what would you do this is what they would end up with which is another color photograph so this is what it looks like now and here 's our proposal the ancient biota the current farming and and the protocols we studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air fresh water and we lay out the building areas we start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be the transportation is all so that there 's the waste systems all connect if you flush a toilet the waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat and then it makes natural gas which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking and then the compost is all taken back where we 've got farming because what we 've done is lifted up the landscape into the air to to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings and this is the concept for the top of the city we 've lifted the earth and this is the new city"
