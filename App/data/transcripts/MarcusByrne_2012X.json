  "transcript": "and what i want to do today is share my passion for poo with you but i think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo and it seems appropriate to start at the end because this is a waste product that comes out of other and and in the world we have about six thousand species of dung beetles so according to dung beetles dung is pretty good unless you 're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself you 'll never see ninety percent of the dung beetle species because they go directly into the dung and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground so and most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort ten percent of the species usually bury it at a remote place so this is a very proud owner and he 's clearly very pleased about and then he 's about to become a victim of a vicious clear indication and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because and we think it 's the intense competition that makes the beetles so what you 've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the african veld and at the same so what i want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles so watch this beetle and there 's two things that i would like you to be aware of the first is how it deals with this obstacle that we and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place a and that 's a very very important thing because and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet and watch its response so our next question then was how are they doing this what are they doing and there was a cue that that was available to us it was that every now and then they 'd climb on top of the ball look at the world around them and what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball what are the obvious cues that this animal could use and the most obvious one and the obvious thing to look at in that what we did was we moved and look at what the beetle does it and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place what happens now so clearly they 're looking at the sun the sun is a very important cue in the sky for them the thing is the sun is not always because at sunset it disappears below the horizon what is happening in the sky here is that there 's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky but the sun is at the horizon over here and we know so how do we test that well that 's easy what we do is we get a great big polarization filter pop the beetle underneath it and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right hand turn because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in so obviously beetles can see polarized light so what we 've got so far is what are beetles doing they 're rolling balls how are they maintaining it in a particular straight line well they 're looking at celestial cues in the sky some of which but how do they pick up those celestial cues that was what was of interest to us next and it was this particular little behavior the dance we thought was important because look it takes a pause every now and then and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in so and you can see he wasn 't particularly forced into this particular and we gradually displaced the beetle by one hundred and eighty degrees and let 's see what his reaction is as he 's headed through ninety degrees here and see what his response is he does a little dance he turns around and heads back in so but after spending many years sitting in the african bush watching dung beetles on nice we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior every now and then when they climb on top of the ball they wipe their face and you see him do it again now we thought now what could be going on here and when they do this particular dance they wipe the bottom of so what we did was design a couple of arenas so what you 're looking at dung is cool so so the background here is around about fifty degrees centigrade the beetle itself and what 's of interest here is that little brain but if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment and all the time it 's trying to cool itself and what we did then was put little boots because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on so this is called stilting it 's a thermal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach we jump onto a however there 's one more story i 'd like to share with you and that 's this particular species and they have a particular behavior that i think you will find interesting this is a dung watch what he 's doing can you spot the difference and it 's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it this is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior there 's one more interesting aspect of this dung and what he 's trying to do is set up a nest and about fifty minutes later that nest is finished and he heads off to forage and provision and what i want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path and compare the two and by and large you 'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path on the outward path he 's always on the lookout for a new blob of dung on the way home he knows where home is and he wants to go straight to it the important thing here is that this is not a one way trip as in most dung beetles the trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site and watch you 're going to see another south african crime taking place right now and his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets so what we 're looking at here is a behavior and what 's taking place is that the beetle it knows exactly where its home is now there 's two ways it could be doing that and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it 's at the foraging site and it knows it should be in that and now we have to see what is going to take place if he 's using landmark orientation should be able to find the burrow because he 'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it so let 's watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test so there he is there he 's about to head home it starts to search for its house in the right distance away from so we know now that this animal uses path integration and the callous experimenter leads it top left and we 're looking at here and we know that these species here actually count the steps that 's what they use as an odometer a step counting system we don 't know yet what dung behavior that you and i"
