  "transcript": "not just a few astronauts thousands of people are going to colonize mars and i am telling you that they 're going to do this why the heck should we do this twelve years ago i gave a ted talk on ten ways the world could end suddenly we are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy a single large asteroid could take us out forever to survive we have to reach beyond the home planet think what a tragedy it would be if all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated and there 's another reason we should go exploration is in our dna two million years ago humans evolved in africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons this stuff is inside us and they prospered doing that some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology came because we explored and yes we should all be taking far and yes i worry we could screw up mars he excited an entire generation to dream perhaps then we will but first a few fascinating facts about where we 're going this picture actually represents the true size of mars compared to earth mars is not our sister planet it 's far less than half the size of the earth and yet despite the fact that it 's smaller the surface area of mars that you can stand on is equivalent to the surface area of the earth that you can stand on because the earth is mostly covered by water the atmosphere on mars is really thin one hundred times thinner than on earth and it 's not breathable it 's ninety six percent carbon dioxide although there is quite a range of temperature seasons and years on mars are twice as long as they are on earth and for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day mars has a lot less gravity than on earth and it 's the kind of place where you can jump over your car instead of walk around it as you can see mars isn 't exactly earth like but it 's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system here 's the problem mars is a long way away a thousand times farther away from us than our own moon the moon is two hundred and fifty thousand miles away and that 's only if we launch on a very specific day at a very specific time once every two years when mars and the earth are aligned just so so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest two hundred and forty days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can we and the russians the europeans the japanese the chinese and the indians have actually sent forty four rockets there and the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed only about a third of the missions to mars have been successful we once had that rocket the saturn v a couple of saturn vs would have gotten us there it was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans and it was the rocket that took us to the and we decided to do something so getting to mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question some pundits think if we got there by two thousand and fifty that 'd be a pretty good achievement these days nasa seems to be saying maybe they can i believe that they can get human beings into mars orbit by we 're going to land on mars in his name is elon musk he 's the ceo of tesla motors and spacex he actually told me that we would land on mars by but elon musk is more optimistic than i am and that 's going a ways so i 'm giving him a couple of years of slack still you 've got to ask yourself can this guy really do this by well let 's put a decade with elon musk into a little perspective where was this ten years ago that 's the tesla electric automobile in two thousand and five a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying we would not have a decent electric car for fifty years and where was that that is spacex 's falcon nine rocket lifting six tons of supplies to the international space so i think it 's a pretty good bet that the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry in less than ten years and the person who created an entire rocket company in less than ten years will get us to private companies are leaping into space and they will be happy to take you to mars nasa may not be able water is the basis of all life as we know it but it turns out that it 's not the soil alone on mars contains up to sixty percent water and a number of orbiters that we still have flying around mars have shown us and by the way that 's a real photograph here 's a view of a little dig the phoenix lander did in two thousand and eight showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice that white stuff is ice in the second picture which is four days later than the first picture you can see that some of it is evaporating orbiters also tell us that there are huge amounts of underground water on mars as well as glaciers it takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor this is a device cooked up at the university of washington back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and it turns out the mars atmosphere is often one hundred percent humid next we have to worry about what we will breathe frankly i was really shocked to find out that nasa has this problem worked out i love this thing it 's a reverse fuel cell essentially that sucks in the martian atmosphere and pumps out but the secret to this and that 's just for testing the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the to be scalable by a factor of one hundred but we 're not going to be able to grow more than fifteen to twenty percent of our food there at least not until water is running on the surface of mars and we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops and it will be dried and then we need some shelter but this really only works during the daytime it turns out that the soil on mars by and large and then you will be able to or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes atmosphere piled up on us which creates fifteen pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times and we 're constantly pushing out against that on mars there 's hardly any atmospheric pressure so dava newman so let 's think about this for a minute food shelter but it 's still a little complicated and a little difficult so that leads to the next big really big step reengineering an entire planet but the truth is that the technology to do everything i 'm about to tell you already exists first we 've got to warm it up mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere both of which are covered with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide dry ice if we heat it up it sublimes directly into the atmosphere and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on earth and as we know co2 is an incredibly potent my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very very large solar sail and focus it it essentially serves as a mirror and focus it on the south pole of mars at first as the planet spins it will heat up all that dry ice sublime it and it will go into the atmosphere it actually won 't take long for the temperature on mars to start rising probably less than twenty years but then they go down to minus one hundred at night shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect enough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on mars especially the ice in the ground melt as the atmosphere gets thicker everything gets better we get more protection from radiation more atmosphere makes us warmer makes the planet warmer so we get running water and that makes crops mars will be made to feel a lot like british columbia but humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable there is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish and no telling what we can do with our in biology right now we are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics what the genes in our own bodies are doing and but what would you do there how would you live it 's going to be the same as it is on earth some idiot will start a reality tv show there will be software companies there will be hotels there will be bars and i think it will be the most inspiring remember when we landed humans on the moon when that happened people looked at each other and said if we can do this we can do anything it will make us a spacefaring species and that means humans will survive no matter what happens on earth thank you"
