  "transcript": "really here to talk about is the how okay so how exactly do we create this innovation now i want to tell you a quick story we 'll go back a little more in fact the date i 'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date it was february 3rd two thousand and eight anyone remember what happened february 3rd two thousand and eight and the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues john king and halee fischer wright and i noticed as we began to debrief various super bowl parties is that it seemed to us that across the and they had discussed things of great national importance like do we like the budweiser commercial and if you go back in time but when we talked to people it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states now what is a tribe a tribe is a group of about twenty so we sent the following email off to forty newspaper editors the following day february 4th we posted it on our website this was before super tuesday we said the tribes that we 're in are saying it 's going to be the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous ten years studying tribes studying these naturally occurring groups all of you are members of tribes in which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe and make introductions if you focus in on a group like this this happens to be a usc game and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people you would in fact see not a single crowd just like there is not a single crowd here but you would see these tribes that are then coming together and from a distance it appears that it 's a single group and so people form tribes they always have they always will just as fish swim and birds fly people form tribes it 's just what we do but here 's the rub not all tribes are the same if you can find a way to take the tribes that you 're in and nudge them forward along these tribal stages to what we call stage this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen but it 's one that i think we need to learn from produces people who do horrible things this is the kid who shot up virginia tech stage one is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes and then pool together with people who think like they do and i want to make the point that as members of society we need in effect life sucks steve zaffron and i argue that as people see the world so they behave well if people see the world in such a way that life sucks then their behavior will follow automatically from that it will be despairing hostility do whatever it takes to survive even if that means undermining other people now my birthday is coming up which looks like this now am i saying that in every department of motor vehicles across the land you find a stage two culture what i will say when i 'm standing in line is how can people be so dumb and yet live but i 'm saying the culture makes people dumb stage two culture and we find these in all sorts of different places you find them in fact in the best organizations in the world you find them in all places in society i 've come across them at i mean if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldn 't suck but i don 't so it does if that 's how you talked imagine what kind of work would get done what kind of innovation would in fact it would be basically nil now when we go on to stage three this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us because it is in stage three that many of us move and we park and we stay now imagine having a whole room of people saying in effect i 'm great and you 're not or i 'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that a whole group of people but in this case three doctors walk into an elevator i happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book and one doctor said to the others did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine and the other said no that 's great congratulations the next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said well while you were you know doing your research notice the condescending tone while and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery that eventually we 'll train monkeys to do or cells or robots or maybe not even need to do it at all i was off running the future of the residency program which is really the future of medicine and they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back and the we find these in places where really smart successful people show up like oh i don 't know let 's take a look at a quick video snippet this is from a employees volunteer time in the advice booth notice it looks like something out of a peanuts cartoon okay notice how it 's decorated notice people are applauding for us they don 't know who we are and they don 't care and if they did they probably wouldn 't applaud again how they decorate their office now what 's important to people at zappos these may not be the things that are important to you but they value things like fun and they value creativity one of their stated values is be a little bit weird and you 'll notice they are a so when individuals come together and find something that unites them that 's greater than their individual and it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly people into something larger into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence stage four tribes can do remarkable things but you 'll notice we 're not at the top of the mountain yet there is in fact another stage this is a scene or snippet and people came together focused only on those two values truth and reconciliation there was no road map no one had ever done anything like this before and in this atmosphere where the only guidance was people 's and people at the time feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end in fact south africa has not gone down that road largely because people like desmond tutu set up a stage five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country to bring everyone together so people hear this and got it i don 't want to talk stage one that 's like don 't want to talk like they do at the particular dmv that 's close to where dave lives i really don 't want to just say i 'm great because that kind of sounds narcissistic and then i won 't have any friends saying we 're great that sounds pretty good but i should really talk stage five right life is great well in fact there are three somewhat findings that come out of all this the first one if you look at the declaration of independence and actually read it the phrase in who is not great great leaders what about gandhi what about martin luther king i mean surely these were just people who preached life is great right just one little bit of happiness and joy after another in fact martin luther king 's most famous line was at stage three he didn 't say we have a dream he said i have a dream why did he do that because most people are not at stage five oriented by our values saying we 're and our values are beginning to unite us only two percent only two percent of tribes get to stage five and those are the ones that change the world so the first little finding from this now here is what happened to this person who eventually became mayor of san francisco he went from being alive and folding his arms sitting down in a chair so i 'm going to sit here in my chair and not i want to argue that we 're doing that right here ted represents a set of values and as we unite around these values something really interesting begins to then at the reception tonight i 'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach extend your influence but instead find someone you don 't know and find someone else you don 't know and introduce them but i connect people who don 't know each other to stage pretty much everybody else who does polls if gallup releases a poll on the same day that nbc releases a poll people will pay attention to the gallup poll okay we understand that instead of just polling what asia thinks or what the united states thinks or who thinks what about obama versus mccain or something like that what does the entire world think and suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out how do we survey the population how do we survey populations that don 't have access to technology and speak languages we don 't speak and we don 't know anyone who speaks those languages because in order to achieve on this great mission we have to be able to do it incidentally they did pull it off and they released the the tribes that you 're in and nudge them forward"
