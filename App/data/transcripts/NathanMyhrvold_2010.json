  "transcript": "we invent my company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas and we do that for a couple of reasons we invent for fun invention is a lot of fun to do and we also invent for profit so we do this fun and profit oriented inventing for most of what we do but we also have a program where we invent for humanity and we say are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems which is with dramatic crazy out of the box solutions bill gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work so thank you so i 'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we 've got some solutions underway vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health a fantastic thing but in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before they 're administered almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures they go bad very quickly if you don 't it 's not just the loss of the vaccine this is one of the ways that one of these styrofoam chests this lasts six months with no power in uganda being tested the reason we were able to come up with this is is two key ideas one is that this is similar to a cryogenic dewar something you 'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in they have incredible insulation the other idea is kind of interesting which is you can 't reach inside anymore because if you open it up and reach inside you 'd let the heat in the game would be over so the inside of this thing actually looks like a coke machine so a simple idea which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in africa and around the world 'll move on to malaria malaria is one of the great public health problems esther duflo talked a little bit about this two hundred million people a year every forty three seconds a child in africa dies twenty seven will die during my talk and there 's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the involved so what can we do about it well there are a that 's great except the places that have malaria really bad they don 't have health care systems a vaccine would be a terrific thing only they don 't work yet people have tried for a long time there are a couple of interesting candidates it 's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for and bed nets are very effective if you use them you don 't always use them for that people fish with them they don bed nets have an effect on the epidemic but you 're never going to make it extinct with bed nets it 's an incredibly complicated but that 's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria there 's a lot of potential ways in so we hope this year to prototype each of these devices one does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic 's you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it the other thing in fact you may be able to do this directly without drawing any blood at all or through your nail beds because if you actually look through your fingernails you can see blood vessels and once you see blood vessels we think we can see the malaria it 's produced by the malaria parasite this is our femtosecond laser lab and now we can actually and using both this technique and other optical techniques we think we can make those diagnostics we also have another therapy for malaria a way in acute cases to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system sort of like doing dialysis but for relieving the parasite and so nearly any problem that you pose we like to try to solve with some software or reduce it is you don 't know what 's the most effective thing to do we heard about bed nets earlier you spend a certain amount per bed net you can give drug administration there 's all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness which we 'll show you now we have every we have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data that 's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you 've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed so that sets the stage on which you do this you then have to introduce the mosquitoes and you have to model that ultimately it gives you this it nearly goes away in the dry season because there 's no place for the and then of course the next year it comes roaring back by doing these kinds of we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life to be able to simulate both the the economic trade offs how many bed nets versus how much spraying or the social trade offs what happens if unrest breaks out this is a high speed camera view of a this is a real ad make up once upon a time this was the primary technique and in fact many countries got rid of malaria through ddt the united states did so we we 've done all these things that are focused on the plasmodium the parasite involved what can we do to the mosquito well let 's try to kill it with consumer electronics that sounds silly but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use your blu ray player has a very cheap blue laser your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that 's used to steer a laser beam very accurately that 's what makes those little dots on the so what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers and let 's think of what could happen if we could do that well we could protect very high value targets like clinics clinics are full of people that have malaria they 're sick and so they 're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes you really want our photons are one hundred percent organic they 're completely natural you could if you 're really smart you could shine a a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size and then you could decide is this an insect i want to kill or an insect i don 't want to kill moore 's law made computing cheap so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down now it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes they 're the only ones that are are dangerous mosquitoes only in the lab we feed ours raisins so this sounds really crazy right would you like to see it and pablos holman over here he 's got mosquitoes in the tank and we 're going to show you take it away eric eric johanson and we have this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around and pablos if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying which is kind of fun next we can actually light them up with a laser and we can actually pick up a wing beat frequency so you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around nm that 's a mosquito wing beat you 're hearing let 's see what this looks like there you can see mosquitoes as they fly around being lit up this is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what 's happening here we have it running at high speed mode so this system that was built for ted is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this and we 're looking very hard at cost effective to use in places like africa and it wouldn 't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit we 've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair the wing motor is here we 're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down so that 's what i have thanks very much"
