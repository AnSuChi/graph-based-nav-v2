  "transcript": "is the air jordan three black cement first released in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight this is the shoe that started nike marketing as we know it this is the shoe that and perhaps saved nike it 's been re released four times it 's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down and right about now most of you are probably thinking sneakers some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and nike and how they 're all related possibly to the future of all online commerce and that 's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale and just minutes after that thousands of those pairs were on ebay for two and three times retail but here 's the thing this happens every single saturday every week there 's another release or two or three and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling as the jordan three black cement this is nike building the marketplace for because who else is going to buy a pair of $ eight thousand back to the future sneakers and while that 's obviously the anomaly the resell sneaker market is definitely years in the making what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much now we have sneaker addictions and that 's a conservative estimate 37 year old sneakerhead i grew up playing basketball when michael jordan played i always wanted air jordans my mother would never buy me air jordans as soon as i got some after starting three companies i took a job as a strategy consultant when i very quickly realized because i had to and i liked it so i thought i wonder if i could get ahold of some sneaker data just to play with for my own amusement the goal was to develop a price guide a real data driven view of the market others have used the data to validate insurance claims and here 's the best part have sneaker portfolios laughter so sneakerhead dan builds his collection and identifies which three hundred and fifty two are his he can see it 's worth one hundred and three thousand dollars frankly a modest collection at the asset level he can see gain loss by shoe here he 's made over six hundred dollars on one pair i have one of those so an unregulated one point two billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online and has spawned fundamental financial services for and two comparisons started to emerge are sneakers more like stocks or drugs in fact one guy emailed to say he thought his 15 year old son was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers and that 's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists and blow pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school the cards are long dead and the candy market 's usually quite local for a lot of people and accessible investment opportunity but also unregulated which is why the story you 're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers it 's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe in fact it 's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story so sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor someone is making the rules that someone including jordan brand accounts for and profit on the secondary market is about a third skechers earlier this year became the number two footwear brand in the country skechers 's net income was two hundred and nine million dollars that means that nike 's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor that how is that even possible but nike 's gotten very good at using supply limited sneakers and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit so it 's really just supply sneakerheads joke that as long as it 's limited and nike they 'll buy it it 's no different than any other collectible market only this isn 't a market at all myself included if nike wanted to kill the resell market they could do so all they have to do is release more shoes but we certainly don 't want them to nor is it in their best interest that 's because unlike apple who will sell an iphone to anyone who wants one and enable nike to sell millions of $ sixty sneakers it 's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before this isn 't in any textbook with a facebook level hyped ipo every single weekend and sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week you know those crazy iphone lines you see on the news every other year year nike lines happen one hundred and four times more often there are very few if any legal unregulated markets there is no central exchange by last count there were forty eight different online markets that i know of some are ebay clones some are mobile markets and then you have consignment shops and brick and mortar stores and sneaker conventions and reseller sites and facebook and instagram and twitter come into contact with each other shoes will be bought and sold but that means no efficiencies no transparency sometimes not even authenticity can you imagine if that 's how stocks were bought including every time you walk down the street just hoping to pass someone wearing some apple stock never knowing who had the best price or even if the stock were looking at was real that would surely make you say [ wtf ] but what if that 's not how we need to buy sneakers either and what if it wasn 't just sneakers but any similar product like watches and handbags and women 's shoes and any collectible any seasonal item and any markdown item what if there was a stock market for commerce a stock market shorts and options and futures maybe you want to invest in a stock market because if you had invested in a pair of air jordan three black cement in two thousand and eleven you could either be wearing them onstage or have earned one hundred and sixty two percent on your money double the s & p and twenty percent more than apple thank you"
