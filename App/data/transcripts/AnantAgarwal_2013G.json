  "transcript": "the last year has seen the invention of a new four letter word it starts with an m mooc massive open online many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world in the millions in this discussion today i 'm going to focus on a different aspect of we are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education so here 's a classroom and this was a classroom about fifty or sixty years ago and this is a classroom today the seats are in color whoop de do education really hasn 't changed in the past five hundred years the last big innovation everything is different education hasn 't changed it 's and the person you see at the end of the stage but the students way in the back two hundred feet away from the instructor i think they are undergoing education now i really believe that we can transform education both in quality and scale and access through technology at edx are trying to transform education through online technologies micromanaging it we really have to completely reimagine it it 's like going from ox carts to the airplane even the infrastructure has to change everything has to change we need to go from we have to go to interactive virtual so at edx and a number of other organizations we are applying these technologies to education through moocs to really increase access to education and you heard of this example where when we launched our very first course and this was circuits and electronics course about a year year and a half ago one hundred and fifty five thousand students from one hundred and sixty two countries enrolled in this course and we had no marketing budget now one hundred and fifty five thousand is a big number this number is bigger than the total number of alumni of mit in its i would have to teach for forty years before i could teach this many students so today i want to discuss a different aspect the other side of moocs take a different perspective we are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom to create a blended model of learning when my daughter i call it teen lish it 's a digital language it 's got two sounds a grunt and a silence honey come over for dinner i texted her i said no that must have been by accident she must have thought you know some friend of hers was calling her so i text her she responds it 's just been absolutely great so our millennial generation is built differently now i 'm older and my youthful looks might belie that but the millennial generation is completely so why are we fighting it in the classroom let 's not fight it let 's embrace it in fact i believe and i have two fat thumbs i can 't text very well but what if we embraced technology embraced the millennial generation 's so here 's what we can do so rather than driving our kids into a classroom herding them out there at eight o 'clock in the morning i hated going to class at eight o 'clock in the morning so why are we forcing our kids to do that so instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms in their bedroom in the dining room in the they 're most creative then they come into the classroom in fact with edx when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world this was happening unbeknownst to us two high school teachers at the sant high school in mongolia where the learners in the high school 15 year olds mind you would go and do these things in their they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work so we did a pilot experimental blended courses working with san jose state university in california again with the circuits and electronics course you 'll hear that a lot that course has become the instructors flipped the classroom blended online and in person and the results were staggering now don 't take these results to the bank just yet so traditionally semester upon semester for the past several years this course again a hard course the failure rate fell to nine percent so the results can be extremely extremely good now before we go too far into this i 'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas what are some key ideas that makes all of this work one idea is active learning the idea here is rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures so a student might watch a video and follow that with an interactive exercise think of this as the ultimate and this is a form of learning called active learning and really promoted by a very early paper the second idea is self pacing and then i would lose they can rewind the professor with instant how else do you teach one hundred and fifty thousand students your computer is grading all the exercises and we 've all submitted homeworks and and this little green check mark that you see here here is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edx learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark he then went on to take a software course from berkeley at the end of the year and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course check mark oh god have i missed you when 's the last time you 've seen students posting comments like this about homework my colleague ed bertschinger who heads up the physics department at mit has this to say about instant feedback he indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning so as this little video shows and this can also be graded by the computer we use discussion forums and discussions and facebook like interaction not but to really help students learn let me tell you a story when we did our circuits course for the one hundred and fifty five thousand students i didn 't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course i told my tas okay twenty four seven we 're going to be up monitoring the forum answering questions they had answered questions for one hundred students how do you do that for one hundred and fifty thousand so one night i 'm sitting up there at two a m at night and i think there 's this question from a student from pakistan and before i can finish boom boom and all i had to do was go and bless it good answer so this this is absolutely amazing where students are learning from each other and they 're telling us that they are learning by teaching now this is all not just in the future so we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world from tsinghua in china to the national university of mongolia in mongolia to berkeley in california all over the world and these kinds of technologies really help the blended model can really help revolutionize education the business aspect we can also license these mooc courses to other universities and therein i would like to have you dream with me for a little bit i would like us to really reimagine education we will have to move from lecture halls to e spaces we have to move from bricks and mortar school buildings but i think at the end of the day i think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end thank you"
