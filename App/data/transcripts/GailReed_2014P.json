  "transcript": "i want to tell you how twenty thousand remarkable young people from over one hundred countries ended up in cuba and are transforming health in their communities ninety percent of them would never have left home at all if it weren 't for a scholarship to study medicine in cuba and a commitment to go back to places like the ones they 'd come from ghettos to become doctors for people like themselves to walk the walk havana 's latin american medical school it 's the largest medical school in the world graduating thousand young doctors since its first class of two thousand and five with nearly ten thousand more in the pipeline its mission to train physicians for the people who need them the most the over one billion who have never seen a doctor the people who live and die under every poverty line ever invented they 're recruited from the poorest most broken places on our planet by a school that believes they can become not just the good but the excellent physicians their communities desperately need that they will practice where most doctors don 't in places not only poor but oftentimes dangerous carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks or navigating neighborhoods riddled by drugs gangs and bullets their home ground and even the way medicine itself is learned and practiced and that they will become pioneers in our global reach for universal health coverage surely a tall order two big storms and this notion of walk the walk prompted creation of elam back in the hurricanes georges and mitch had ripped through the caribbean and central leaving thirty thousand dead and two and a half million homeless hundreds of cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response but when they got there they found a bigger disaster whole communities with no healthcare doors bolted shut on rural hospitals for lack of staff and just too many babies dying before their birthday what would happen when these cuban doctors left new doctors were needed to make care sustainable but where would they come from where would they train the campus of a former naval academy was turned over to the cuban health ministry to become the latin american medical school elam tuition room and board and a small stipend were offered to hundreds of students from the countries hardest hit by the storms as a journalist in havana i watched the first ninety seven nicaraguans arrive in march one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine settling into dorms barely refurbished and helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms but move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes over the next few years governments throughout the americas requested scholarships for their own students and the congressional black caucus asked for and received among the twenty three thousand are graduates from eighty three countries in the americas africa and asia and enrollment has grown to one hundred and twenty three nations more than half the students are young women they come from one hundred ethnic groups speak fifty different languages who director margaret chan said for once if you are poor female or from an indigenous population you have a distinct advantage ethic that makes this medical school unique luther castillo comes from san pedro de tocamacho on the atlantic coast of honduras there 's no running water no electricity there and to reach the village you have to walk for hours or take your chances in a pickup truck like i did skirting the waves of the atlantic luther was one of forty tocamacho children who started grammar school the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people known as the garfuna luther had to walk three hours every day to middle school only and only one to university among the first crop of garfuna graduates now there sparked by big ideas imagination and audacity but also solutions that work elam 's faculty had no handy evidence base to guide them so they learned the hard way by doing and correcting course as they went even the brightest students from these poor communities weren 't academically these were mapuche indigenous peoples who learned spanish as a second language or haitians who spoke creole so spanish became part even so in cuba the smells just about everything was different embracing diversity became a way of life so many countries asked for these scholarships because our global health crisis is fed by a crisis in human resources we are short four to seven million health workers just to meet basic needs and the problem is everywhere where only half the world 's people live and within cities not in the shantytowns or south l a we don 't have the professionals we need by two thousand and twenty we will be short relying on strong primary care a commission from the lancet rates cuba among the best countries in health save the children ranks cuba the best country in latin america to become a mother while spending per person one what we do on health here in the usa elam is tough but eighty percent of its students graduate the subjects are familiar basic and clinical sciences but there are major differences first sure they have lectures on day one second students treat the whole patient mind and body in the context of their families their communities and their culture social and economic that a good patient interview especially as chronic diseases cripple health also comes with a team approach as much how to work in teams community health workers to help them become better at what they do not to replace them to work with shamans and traditional healers dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they 're capable of doing take the garfuna grads they not only went to work back home but they organized their communities to build honduras ' first indigenous hospital with an architect 's help residents literally raised it from the ground up upholding the hospital as a model of rural public health for honduras elam 's graduates are smart strong and also dedicated january two thousand and ten the pain people buried under thirty million tons of rubble overwhelming three hundred forty cuban doctors were already on the ground long term more were on their way many more were needed at elam students worked round the clock to contact two thousand graduates as a result hundreds arrived in haiti countries ' worth from mali in the sahara to st lucia bolivia chile and the usa they spoke easily to each other in spanish and listened to their patients in creole even through the cholera epidemic hundreds of haitian graduates today with aid of dozens of new health centers have been built staffed yet the haitian story also illustrates some of the bigger problems faced in many countries take a haitian graduates by two thousand and twelve when cholera struck nearly half working in the public health sector but one quarter unemployed and one hundred and ten had left haiti altogether so in the best case scenarios these graduates are staffing and thus strengthening public health systems where often they 're the only doctors around in the worst cases there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector where most poor people are treated not enough political will not enough resources not enough anything desperate to make ends meet so when there are no public sector jobs these new mds decamp into private practice or go abroad to send money home fearful these grads will take their jobs or reduce their patient loads and income it 's not a question of competencies here in the usa the california medical board accredited the school after rigorous inspection passing their boards and accepted into highly respected residencies from new york to chicago to new mexico two hundred strong they 're coming back to the and also dissatisfied as one grad put it in cuba and you tell me that 's not possible i know it 's not true not only have i seen it work i 've done the work elam 's graduates from right here in d c and baltimore have come from the poorest of the poor to offer health education now we need to do our part to support the twenty three thousand and counting all of us residency directors they need jobs in the public health sector or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work they need the chance to be the doctors their patients need we may have to find our way back to that pediatrician who would knock on my family 's door on the south side of chicago when i was a kid who made house calls who was a public servant these aren 't such new ideas of what medicine should be what 's new new is the scaling up and the faces of the doctors themselves an elam graduate is more likely to be a she than a he peru or guatemala an indigenous doctor in the usa a doctor of color who speaks fluent spanish she is well trained can be counted on and shares the face and culture of her patients she is teaching us to walk the walk"
