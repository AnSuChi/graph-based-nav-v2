  "transcript": "was walking to market that morning ran towards where the gunshot had come from and found a young man writhing in agony well known revolutionary in paris at the time and the last words he said to his brother were don 't cry for me alfred i need all the courage i can muster to die at the age of twenty but the academicians couldn 't understand anything that he this is how he wrote most of his mathematics and as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny he left this pile of papers on the table but contained inside those documents was a new language a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science namely symmetry now symmetry is almost nature 's language it helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world for example molecular structure what crystals are possible we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry in microbiology you really don 't want to get a but on a larger scale of biology actually symmetry is very important because it actually communicates genetic information i 've taken two pictures here and i 've made them artificially symmetrical and if i ask you which of these you find more beautiful you 're probably drawn to the lower two because it is hard to make symmetry and if you can make yourself symmetrical you 're sending out a sign that you 've got good genes you 've got a good upbringing and therefore you 'll make a good mate so symmetry is a language which can help to communicate genetic information symmetry can also help us to explain what 's happening in the large hadron collider in cern or what 's not happening in the large hadron collider in cern to be able to make predictions about the and i think galileo summed up very nicely the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us he wrote the universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word artists too love to play around with symmetry and he says he shuddered at its perfect precision found it deathly the very marrow of death and just after this photo was taken and the gateway you see behind has eight columns with beautiful symmetrical designs on and i said to professor kurokawa wow the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they 'd made a mistake and put this one upside down and he said no no no it was a very deliberate act and he referred me to this lovely quote from the japanese essays in idleness from the 14th century in which the essayist in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth but if i had to choose recently i took my family we do these rather kind of so i wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the alhambra you see it already immediately you go in the reflective symmetry in the water and it was galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions for galois move it in some way so it looks the same as before you moved it i like to describe it as the magic trick moves what can you do to something you close your eyes i do something put it back down again it looks like it did before it started but it 's also about producing a language to describe this and the power of mathematics is often to to change one thing perhaps push you a little bit mathematically so brace yourselves push you a little bit to understand how this language works which enables us to capture what is symmetry so and still it looks now for galois there was actually a sixth symmetry can anybody think what else i could do to this which would leave it but what i could do is just leave it where it is pick it up and put it down again actually the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept seventh century a d it seems and this is the same idea this is a symmetrical so everything has symmetry where you just leave it where it is so this object has six symmetries five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where i just pick it up and leave it where it is so both of these objects have six symmetries and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it so here is a little question for you and i 'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have how many things can i do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube okay but let 's go back down to symmetries that i got for these two objects what galois realized it isn 't just the individual symmetries but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object the combination is a third magic trick move and here we see galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object so i 've given names the capital letters a which is a sixth of a it still ends and there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other let 's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle one after the other let 's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise and reflect in the line through x well the combined effect is as if i had just done the reflection in the line through z to start with the combined effect the triangle ends up somewhere y now it matters what order you do the operations in but the way the symmetries interact and you can try this when you go down to the pub later on take a beer mat and rotate it by a and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction now galois produced some laws for how these tables how symmetries interact it 's almost like little sudoku tables you don 't see any symmetry twice in any row or column and using those rules he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries or the symmetries of the six pointed starfish the people and the chairs are very different here are two very different walls very different geometric pictures but using the language of galois we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same and everything matches up and then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge where i can rotate by one hundred and eighty degrees now let 's move to the very and it 's a symmetry we call this is a wall a ceiling and a floor they all look very different but this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical and one by half a turn it turns out they almost did you can prove using galois ' language there it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these seventeen but these are things that we can see and the power of galois ' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects in the unseen world beyond the and that 's where i work i create mathematical objects symmetrical objects using galois ' language in very high dimensional spaces so i think it 's a great example of things unseen which the power of mathematical language allows you to unfortunately it isn 't really a picture if i could have my but here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact so i 'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn 't been named before and this thing it will make you immortal in order to win this symmetrical what you have to do is to answer the question i asked you at the beginning how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have okay if you think you 've got an estimate for how many digits right we 've already got one competitor here if you all stay down he wins it automatically five six great excellent that should get us going all right five or less digits sixty digits or more you 've got to sit down you 've overestimated how many digits are there in your number two so you should have sat down earlier if i told you twenty or less stand up because okay how many okay good how many do you have in yours eighteen so it goes to this lady here twenty one is the closest it actually has the number of symmetries in the rubik 's cube has twenty five digits so now i need to name this object so what is your name i need your surname symmetrical objects generally there we go that 's your new symmetrical object you are now immortal in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth"
