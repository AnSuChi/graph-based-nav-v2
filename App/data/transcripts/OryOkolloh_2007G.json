  "transcript": "image got do and i must say i think emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages because i 'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up but i 'm going to try and do something different and close the loop with some of my personal stories and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we 've been talking about so africa is a complex continent full of contradictions as you can see we 're not the only ones applause and you know it 's we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent just think about that and this is typically what we 've been talking about the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff now why is that and some of you might be standing here thinking all you privileged people come here saying ' forget the poor people let 's focus on business and the markets and whatever ' and they 're all there 's the eighty percent of africans who and it 's the story of many of the africans who are here we start with poverty i didn 't grow up in the slums or anything that dire i know what it is to grow up without having money or being able to support family euvin was talking about bellwether signs the bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast you know we had eggs and sausages when things were bad we had porridge cousins their parents and they adopted a very interesting approach to education which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford elementary school and what happened was because they could afford it sometimes sometimes not i got kicked out pretty much every term someone would come in with a list of the people who haven 't paid school fees and when they started getting pretty strict you had to leave until your school fees could be paid but they kept at it and i now understand why they did what they did and there 's national schools which are like the best schools and provincial schools you know what am i going to do and maybe she 'll let you in if and because we didn 't have privilege and because and i sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him saying you know who do you think you are and and there 's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated and we left and i swore to myself and i was like i 'm never ever going to have to beg for anything in my life they called me two weeks later can come now and i told them to stuff it my father who i 've been talking about died of aids in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and i 'm pretty much the one who figured it but they were like you know this when i went online and looked at the infectious read about the disease i pretty much realized what was going on but what happened was that he had to be on medication that at that time diflucan which in the states is used for yeast infections cost thirty dollars a pill he had to be on that pill for the rest of his life and up until that time he had a friend who used to travel to india and he used to import bring him could get him a generic version of it and that kept him going but the money ran out he got sick again he got sick on a friday and we could not get cash the family couldn 't get cash for him to start the treatment until monday the hospital put him on a water drip for three days and finally we figured well ok we 'd better just try and take him to a public hospital at least he 'll get treated while we try to figure out the now imagine if and i could go on and on imagine if this is all you know about me how would you look at me you don 't see the and i just wanted to personalize that because we talk about it in big terms and you wonder you know so what but it 's and i 'm not unique right imagine if all you knew about william was the fact that he grew up in a you know and i was just moved i was actually crying during his presentation he was like i try and i make i was like nike should hire him you know just do it and this is again the point i 'm trying to make when you focus just on the disasters we had some of them and this is an example you know blogging is doing that afrigator is an aggregator of african blogs that let 's do it and going back to the point i was trying to make this is the swahili wikipedia swahili is spoken by about fifty million four of them are white males stand up is a tanzanian [ the ] first swahili please we can 't whine why are we not generating our own 's not enough to complain we need to act reuters now integrates african blogs into their coverage of africa so that 's a start and we 've heard of all their other initiatives the we 're still not anywhere in the picture no and you know i walked away from a job with one of the top firms in d c covington and burling six figures with two paychecks or three paychecks i could solve a lot of my family 's problems you know probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a harvard law school degree because of all the things i 'm doing one is because i 'm pretty aggressive and i try and find you know opportunities but there is such a need you know i 'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis and we give them business development services as well as financing loan and equity i twenty dollars a month just for hosting everything else on there is a labor of love we 've manually entered all the data there and you can get profiles of each mp questions we have a comment function where people can ask their mps questions there are some mps who participate and come back and ask and basically we started this because we were tired of complaining i believe that accountability stems from demand you 're not you know they 're not going to change just another thing is that these leaders and what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don 't like and how can we change that so mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable please just share and keep the ideas that you 've gotten out of here going because it can make a difference the other thing i want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual i 've had lots of conversations about things i think need to be happening in africa people are like ok if you don 't do aid i 'm a bleeding heart liberal what can i do you know give me something i can do with paypal it 's and the businesspeople you 've met it can make a huge difference especially in africa because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them my mom 's business had collapsed so i was supporting her my sister was struggling to get through undergrad i was helping her pay her tuition and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me i am able to lift all those people so don 't underestimate that an example this man changed my life he 's a professor he 's now at vanderbilt because he took an interest i was taking a class of his this is an overeager student which we don 't normally get in the united states because everyone else is cynical and jaded he called me to his office and ok because compared to what could have been in kenya and and if they don 't admit you they and this is just an illustration you can meet other individuals here just need a push that 's all i needed was a push to go to the next level you know a gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential you know my vision is that my daughter and any other african child being born today and they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born that 's one thing you americans take for not so good circumstances and you can move just because you are born in rural arkansas whatever that doesn 't define who you are for most africans determine i would like to see that change and the change starts with us and as africans we need to take responsibility for our continent"
