  "transcript": "i will tell everyone that i know a hero named marlon peterson i 'm what garbage looks not the most appealing way to open a talk or start a conversation and perhaps you have some questions going through your head about that why would this man say such a thing about himself what does he mean because when we 're questioning something we 're invested in taking in some sort of new information or grappling with some sort of ignorance that makes us feel uncomfortable and that 's why i 'm here to push us to question even when it makes us uncomfortable my parents are from trinidad and tobago deriving from the african drums and evolving from the genius of one of the ghettos in trinidad a city called laventille and the disregard of the american military well i should tell you america during wwii had military bases set up in trinidad and when the war ended they left the island littered with empty oil drums their trash so people from repurposed the old drums left behind into the full chromatic scale the steel pan playing music now from from beethoven to bob marley to fifty cent those people literally made music i was arrested for my role in a violent four people were shot two were killed like waste material and justifiably so to many i eventually served ten years two months and seven days of a prison sentence i was sentenced to i was sentenced to irrelevance interestingly it was during those years in prison that a series of letters redeemed me helped me move beyond the the darkness and the guilt associated with the worst moment of my young life it gave me a sense that i was useful she was thirteen years old she had wrote that she saw me as a hero i remember reading that and i remember crying when i read those words she was one of over fifty students and one hundred and fifty letters that i wrote during a mentoring correspondence program we called it the young scholars program every time they said they depended on my letters or my words of advice it gave me a sense of what i could contribute to this planet it transformed my life those letters they gave me the permission they gave me the courage to admit to myself that there were reasons not excuses but that there were reasons for that fateful day in october of one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine that the trauma associated with living in a community where guns are easier to get than sneakers that the trauma associated with being raped at gunpoint at the age of fourteen that those are reasons for me because those letters mattered so much to me because writing and receiving and having that communication with those folks so hugely impacted my life i decided to share the opportunity with some friends of mine who were also inside with me my friends bill and cory and arocks all in prison for violent crimes also shared their words of wisdom with the young people as well and received the sense of relevancy in return we are now published writers and youth program innovators and trauma experts and gun violence prevention advocates and ted talkers and and good daddies that 's what i call a positive return of investment all else what building that program taught me was that when we when we sow when we invest in the humanity of people no matter where they 're at we can reap amazing rewards in this latest era of criminal justice reform i often question and wonder why why is it that so many believe that only those who have been convicted of nonviolent drug offenses merit empathy criminal justice reform is human justice am i not human we can do better we can do better than investing solely in law enforcement as a resource because they don 't give us a sense of relevancy that is at the core of why so many of us do so many harmful things in the pursuit of mattering see gun violence is just a visible display of a lot of underlying traumas when we invest in the redemptive value of relevancy we can render a return of both personal responsibility and healing that 's the people work i care about family i 'm asking you to do the hard work the difficult work i 'm asking myself over the past two months i 've lost two friends to gun violence both innocent bystanders one was caught in a drive by while walking home the other was sitting in a caf while eating breakfast while on vacation in miami i because of the hard work of seeing the value thank you"
