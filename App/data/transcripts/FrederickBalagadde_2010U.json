  "transcript": "the greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden we see that sub saharan africa is the worst hit region by hiv aids this is the most we also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease there are very few doctors and quite frankly these countries do not have the resources so what the western countries developed countries have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in third world countries who actually can 't afford these medications and this has already but there is a fundamental problem that is because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don 't have diagnostic services you end up creating a this is already beginning to happen in sub saharan africa the problem is is that what begins as a tragedy in the third world could easily become a global problem and the last thing we want to see is strains of hiv popping up all over the world because it will make treatment more expensive and during that time i actually lost more relatives as well as the teachers who taught me so this became one of the driving passions of my life to help find real solutions that computers used to fill this entire room and people actually used to work inside the computers but what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone and i 'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world in the third world countries the good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories so right now we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories i was very lucky to come to the us right after high school and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices this is a microfluidic chip that i developed a close look at how the technology works these are channels that are about the size of a human hair so what i plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an hiv kit which is the size of an iphone fifty times faster than the current state of the art cost that will be five to five hundred times cheaper so this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the third world at a cost that is actually achievable i invite your interest as well as your involvement thank you very much"
