hundred terabytes of data every month this is a six with fourteen zeroes a very large number and wireless communications has become we use it everyday we use it in our everyday lives now in our private lives in our business lives to be asked sometimes very kindly to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons and it 's this importance why i decided and one of the issues is capacity and radio waves and we only have a certain range of it and it 's this limitation there 's another that is efficiency these one point four million cellular radio masts or base stations consume a lot of energy then there 's another issue that you 're all aware of you have to switch off your mobile phone during flights in hospitals are security issues and security is another issue so these are the main four issues but on the other hand we have fourteen billion of you don 't want to get close to gamma rays it could be dangerous infrared and then we have the radio waves and light has been around so it 's inherently safe to use and wouldn 't it be great to use that for wireless communications not only that i compared and guess what let 's compare that with a number i 've just mentioned we have one point four million expensively deployed inefficient radio cellular base stations you see these light bulbs can we use them for communications one thing we need to do is and it has a very very nice acute property and this is a fundamental basic property that that we exploit with our technology so let 's show how we do that let 's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum go to remote controls led basically you switch on the led and if it 's off you switch it off and it creates a simple not usable for a youtube video what we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can furthermore replace and the technology we have developed it 's called sim ofdm and it 's spacial modulation modulation these are the only technical terms i 'm not going into details but this is how we enabled you will say okay this is nice a slide created in ten minutes but not only that what we 've done is we have also developed a demonstrator and i 'm showing for the first time in public this worth three u s dollars and the light goes through that hole there 's a receiver the receiver will convert these little subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there and that signal is then converted back to a high speed data stream in the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into and not only so what happens when i switch on that light as you would expect it 's a light a desk lamp but at the same time you see this and that 's a video a high definition video that is transmitted through that light this is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here but let me do this once again still don 't believe it is this light that transmits you don 't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we but at the same time we are able to transmit this data and you see even light from the ceiling comes down do i have to have the light on all the time to have this working and the answer is yes but you can dim down the light and you are still able to transmit data that 's possible so there 's no issue of capacity anymore efficiency this is data through illumination it 's first of all and if you do the the energy budget the data transmission comes for free if the whole world would deploy them you would save hundreds of power plants so it 's everywhere in a and then there 's security you would agree with me that so no one if i have a light here if i have secure data no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data and there 's only data where there is light so if i don 't want that receiver to receive the data then turn it away so the data goes in that direction not there anymore now we can in fact see where the data is going to for me the applications of it to me are beyond and but i can give you a few examples well you may see the impact already now and this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things [ use ] to communicate with each other intrinsically safe environments like this petrochemical plant you can 't use rf it may generate antenna sparks but you can use light you see plenty of light there cars can communicate with each other and prevent accidents in the way that they exchange information traffic lights can communicate to the car and then you have these millions of street lamps deployed around the world and every street lamp could be a free access point we call it in fact and each of these lights could be a potential transmitter of wireless data so you could enjoy your most favorite need to do is to fit a small microchip to every and this would then combine two basic functionalities illumination and wireless you would not only have you may have fourteen billion li fis deployed worldwide for a and even a brighter future"
