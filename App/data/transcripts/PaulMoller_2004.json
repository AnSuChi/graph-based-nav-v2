  "transcript": "ask the question you know why is a flying car or maybe more accurately a roadable aircraft possible at this time a number of years ago mr ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available now sixty years later i was living in a rural part of canada on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area scary thing for a young kid to be going through at the end of my first year in school in the summer of that year i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home they and well they were easy to capture i took them outside and as i let them go that split second even though they i thought what a great way to get to school and i was very inspired by that and so so with the goal of creating something that could do for you or me what the hummingbird does and give you that flexibility nimble manner pilot 's license a powerlift pilot 's license for this type of aircraft it 's closer than you think it so for once perhaps the government is ahead of itself the press calls my particular volantor a skycar this is a a little bit earlier version of it that 's why it 's given the x designation and actually in all cities so that 's an asset because if you 've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile forget it you 're never going to fly it one could say that a and gets around in much the same way and it 's true but a helicopter is a very complex device it 's expensive so expensive that very few people could own or use it it 's often been described because of its fragile fragile nature and its complexity as a series of parts a large number of parts flying in formation another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor in my case the skycar volantor is the experience that i 've had in flying both of those in a helicopter you feel and it 's still a remarkable sensation you feel like you 're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane without any vibration what we really need is something to replace the automobile for those 50 plus mile if we can get rid of that then the highways will now be useful to you as contrasted by what 's happening in many parts of the world today on this next slide is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure because the perfect vehicle for use it 's going to have very little value to you unless you 've got a system to use it in i 'm sure any of you have asked the question yeah are there great things up there what am i going to do get up there it 's bad enough on a highway what 's it going to be like to be in the air this world that you 're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated you 're not going to be a pilot you 're going to be a passenger and it 's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes but we have to have these priority changes we have to have infrastructure to go with this historically you see that we got around two hundred years ago by canals and as that system disappeared were replaced by railroads as that disappeared we came in with highways but if you look at that top corner the highway system you see where we are today are no longer being built and where is that going to lead you to so the issue then i 've often asked is when is it going to happen and of course if you ask me i 'm going to give you a really optimistic view after all i 've been spending sixty years here believing it 's going to happen tomorrow so i 'm not going to this i 'd prefer to quote someone else who testified with me before congress and in his position as head of nasa put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft you 're only averaging about thirty miles per hour on average according to and so in effect you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the in the unbeknownst to many of you the highway in the sky it makes use of the gps you 're familiar with gps in your automobile but and there 's a new gps system going to europe called galileo with those three systems you have what is always necessary a level of redundancy that says if one system fails you 'll still have a way to make sure that you being controlled because if you 're in this world where computers are controlling what you 're doing it 's going to be very critical that something can 't fail on you you 'd motor electrically to a vertiport which may be a few blocks maybe even a few miles away this is clearly as i said earlier a roadable aircraft if you can fly like that why are you going to drive around on a highway plug in your destination delivered you can sleep you can read on the way this is the world there won 't be you as and i know the pilots in the audience aren 't going to like that and i 've had a lot of bad feedback from people who who want to be up there flying around and and experiencing that and of course i suppose like recreational parks you can still do that we flew the first vehicle for the international press in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five when i really got it started i was a professor at the u c davis system and and then through the various years we invented various vehicles which is of course very critical still not a practical vehicle during all of this but moving in the right direction finally in the early part of or actually the middle of two thousand and two we flew the four hundred m400 which was the four passenger vehicle in this case here we 're flying it remotely as we always did at the beginning which will make it possible for me to get back on board safest vehicle during the test flight program there 's an old adage that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s when every aeronautical company was working on vertical takeoff aircraft a vertical takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system that 's essential there is no option to that and the adage that i 'm referring to that applied at that time was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down that 's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots in fact the aircraft companies gave up on vertical takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years and there 's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that 's a vertical takeoff aircraft as distinct from a helicopter and that 's the hawker harrier jump jet like the hummingbird which means it requires a lot of energy it 's small it fits exactly where we need to fit it right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system and that sportscar won sports car of the year wonderful engine but only half of what we need my company has spent thirty five years and many millions of dollars we have eight engines in this vehicle we have four computers we have two parachutes if you stick around then good luck there won 't be a more for psychological than real reasons but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that i 'd like to show you an animation in this next one which is one element of the skycar 's use but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used you could think of it personally in your own terms of how you i believe that personal transportation in something like the skycar probably in another volantor form as well miles from san francisco and get there in fifteen minutes you 're going to sell your apartment buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain buy a skycar which i think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of one hundred thousand dollars put money in the bank but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell and that has you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you 're doing and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing i characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism as it 's described which really talks about what i 've experienced and i 'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies"
