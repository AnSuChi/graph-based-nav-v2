  "transcript": "this theater is built on copacabana which is the most famous beach in the world but twenty five kilometers away from here in the north zone of rio lies a community called vila cruzeiro and roughly sixty thousand people live there now the people here in rio mostly know vila cruzeiro from the news and unfortunately news from vila cruzeiro often but vila cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins jeroen koolhaas we first came to rio to shoot a documentary about life in the favelas now we learned that favelas are informal communities they emerged over the years when immigrants from the countryside came to the cities looking for work like cities within the cities so what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built with their own hands without a master plan and like a giant work in progress where we 're from in holland is planned we even have rules for how to follow the rules du and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses and most but we saw some of these and then we imagined one big design so we thought would that even be possible so first we started to count the houses but we soon we had a friend he ran an ngo in vila cruzeiro his name was nanko and he also liked the idea he said you know everybody here would pretty much love to have their houses plastered and painted it 's when a house is finished we picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here we made a few designs and we thought that looked already pretty good but they hated it the people who lived there really hated it they said what did you do you painted our house in exactly the same color as the police station in a favela that is not a good thing also the same color as the prison cell but still it wasn 't good because the little kids started coming up to us and they said you know there 's a boy flying the kite but where is his kite you know you have to imagine the kite and then even the guardian wrote about it notorious slum becomes and we stumbled upon this street and we imagined this river to be a river in japanese style and he specialized in the japanese style so little did we know that we would spend almost an entire year and we even moved into the neighborhood when told us that we could come and live in his house together with his family which was fantastic another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs we learned that during those times people in communities really stick together during these times but we also learned a very important element the importance of barbecues and we got to know everybody in the neighborhood jk we still had this idea of the hill though du yeah yeah we were talking about the scale of this because this painting was incredibly big and it was drove us completely insane but we figured that maybe during this process all the time that we had spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself jk and we figured something out we figured that our ideas our designs had to be a little bit more simple than that last project so that we could and we had an opportunity to try that out in a community and and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if your idea is ridiculously big it 's easier to get people to go along with this and the people of santa marta got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this and this image somehow went all over the and so we immediately said yes we had no idea how but it seemed like a very and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing so and a team of about a dozen young men and women they were hired and together they transformed their own neighborhood the whole street into a giant patchwork of color and at the end the city of philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their how about we do this whole hill now like how many houses are you going to paint how many square meters is that how much paint are you going and maybe it 's a mistake to think like that it would lose some of the magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there you can let the project grow organically and have a life of its own du so what we did is we decided to take this plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art and instead of looking for funding we started a crowdfunding campaign so for us this was an amazing moment because now because now we we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built from the ground on up bottom up with no master plan jk and he 's a local artist from vila cruzeiro very talented guy and he knows almost everybody there and then we employed elias our former landlord who invited us into his house and he 's a master of construction and houses are being plastered as we speak good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next they 're even printing t shirts they 're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody and talking to the press so like the project we did in philadelphia we are also invited to do workshops for instance in curaao and right now we 're planning a huge project in haiti jk so the favela was not only the place where this idea started it was also the place that made it possible to work without a master plan because these communities are informal this was the inspiration and in a communal effort together with the people you can almost work like in an orchestra where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony so we want to thank everybody who and so one day pretty soon when the colors start going up on these walls we hope more people will join us and join this big dream and maybe one day the whole of vila cruzeiro will be painted"
