  "transcript": "if you had been a beehive you or one of the two people you just nodded at would have died and this is the second year in a row we have lost over thirty percent of the colonies or we estimate we 've lost thirty percent of the colonies over the winter now that 's a lot a and we also have this new phenomenon which i talked about last year colony collapse disorder and here we see a picture on top of a hill in central valley last december and below where the colonies are brought in described this not as beehives but as a graveyard with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them and this flu has wiped through the population of bees in some cases and in fact in most cases in one year this flu was caused by a new virus to us or newly identified by us called israeli acute paralysis virus it was called that because a guy in israel first found it and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease because of and so the question we 're still struggling with and the question that keeps us up at night is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases and we don 't have the answer to that yet and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out we think perhaps it 's a combination of factors we know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that you know we 're finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive and surprisingly sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides and so this opens up the whole idea of if you lose a lot of colonies beekeepers can replace them very quickly and that 's why we 've been able to recover from a lot of loss if we lost one in every three cows and in fact america was the first country that ever did mail delivery queens and in fact it 's part of the postal code that that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country and of course and you can install this in your hive and replace that that dead out so it means that beekeepers so even though we 've lost thirty percent of the colonies every year the same number of colonies have existed in the country you would have everyone from the live free or quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer and you get all of these people and these inventive people you will ever meet i mean there may be one hundred but you meet this beekeeper i met this beekeeper here and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers i 've ever met no formal education but very knowledgeable we needed beeswax for a project we were working on he was so capable he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from tin cans and his veil which he used as a screening right in this meadow we also have dave hackenberg who is the poster child of ccd he 's the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells and he has a history of these trucks and he 's moved these bees up and down the coast and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees and that being bad but we 've done that for thousands of years the ancient egyptians used to move bees up and down the nile on rafts so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all and one of our real worries with colony collapse disorder but if you 're losing fifty percent to eighty percent of your colonies you can 't survive three years in a row and we 're really worried about losing this segment of our and they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone and these guys are hurting and they 're not people who like to ask for help although they are the most helpful people ever if there 's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul and so it 's a very dynamic and i think but we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly jam on my and some coffee and had we taken out all those ingredients but clearly it 's said that for bees the flower is the fountain of life and for flowers bees are the messengers of love and that 's a really great expression because you know they get paid for their services they get paid by pollen and nectar to move that male sperm the pollen from flower to flower and there are flowers that are and then you have another apple tree that 's a different type of pollen and bees are very faithful when they 're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower they stay to that crop exclusively in order to help generate and of course they 're made to carry this pollen they build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom honeybees are and there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined we have identified over four hundred species of bees in pennsylvania thirty two species have not been identified or found in the state since which is a very fancy way of saying murdering what 's the word i 'm looking for murdering audience bee dennis vanengelsdorp bee okay thanks they sit there these solitary bees and they collect pollen and make it into a ball and they lay an egg on it well these bees hang out at that hole and they wait for that mother to fly away they go in eat the egg and lay their own egg there so they don 't do any work and so and in fact there is now a red list of pollinators that we 're worried have disappeared if you guys live on the west coast go to these websites here and they 're really looking for people and so it 's not just honeybees bees are not the only important factor here and i 'm glad i 'm a bee man and not a bat man because there 's no money to research the bat problems and bats are dying at an extraordinary rate white nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats if there 's a cave in new york that had fifteen thousand bats in it and there are one thousand left that 's like san francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years and so that 's incredible and there 's no money to do that but i 'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions and that cause is ndd nature deficit and i think we have lost our connection and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment i 've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while and it is terribly engaging and if if we look at the history of lawns it 's actually rather rather tragic they 're totally sterile in two thousand and one eleven percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns i want to say this not because i 'm opposed completely to mowing lawns i think that there is perhaps some and i think we 're encouraged to do that but i also want to reinforce some of the ideas we 've heard here because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational that it is amazing that connection we can have with what 's there these milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years add to watch the different plants or insects that come to these flowers and this is a companion and this is a relationship that never dries up you never run out of that as you drink this wine too and i encourage you to look at that i think that what we"
