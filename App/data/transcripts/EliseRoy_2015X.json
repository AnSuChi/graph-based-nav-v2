  "transcript": "never forget the sound of laughing with my friends i 'll never forget the sound of my mother 's voice right before i fell asleep the comforting sound of water pure fear but i believe believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gifts i 've ever received and i believe that these unique experiences that people with disabilities have is what 's going to help us make and design a better world for everyone both people with and without disabilities ensuring that accommodations were made and then because i was asked to work on the un convention that protects people with disabilities as the leader of the ngo there but somewhere and after many career transitions that my parents weren 't so happy about i stumbled upon a solution that i believe may be an even more powerful tool to solve disability or not and that tool is called design thinking there are five steps the first is defining the problem and understanding its constraints the second throwing out hundreds of ideas the more the better the wilder the better to mimic your solution to test it and to refine it warren berger says that design thinking teaches us to ask those stupid questions because they want to share multiple perspectives and bring them together and ultimately merge them to form something new i saw the potential that it had for the issues i faced so i decided to go back to school and get my master 's in social design this looks at how to use design to create positive change in the world but what i quickly realized was that i was missing out on something as and i couldn 't hear this why not try and solve it my solution was a pair of safety glasses that were engineered to visually alert the user why hadn 't tool designers thought of this before i wasn 't weighed down by expertise or conventional wisdom the second is i was deaf my unique experience of the world helped inform my solution and that ended up being picked up embraced and loved by the mainstream disability or not but it was so comfortable everybody loved it and as you know everybody loves that too i started thinking what if we changed our mindset what if we started designing for disability first not the norm as because this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability can be leveraged a force for creativity and innovation this moves us from the mindset of trying to change the hearts and the deficiency mindset of tolerance to becoming an alchemist the type of magician that this world so desperately i also believe that people with disabilities have great potential to be designers within this design thinking process without knowing it from a very early age i 've been a design thinker fine tuning my skills design thinkers are by nature listening to a conversation and only understanding fifty percent of what is said so without even realizing it my solution was to take the muffled sound i heard and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips i read years later someone commented that my writing i also became really really good at failing quite literally my first semester in spanish d i succeeded design thinking encourages people to fail and fail often because i 'll never forget my coach saying to my mom if she just didn 't have her hearing loss she would be on the national team and what i didn 't even know at the time one example of this is that my visual attention span increased imagine imagine being goalkeeper like i was and the ball is coming down the left flank a person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective of this i had the benefit of a spectrum this wide so i picked up the so that if the ball was passed i could reposition myself and be ready for that shot i 've been a design thinker for nearly all my life my observation skills have been honed so that i pick up on things that others would never pick up on and i 've often had to do this within limitations and constraints this is something that designers also have to deal with frequently my work most recently took me to haiti design thinkers often seek out extreme situations because that often informs some of their best and haiti i lived and worked with three hundred deaf individuals there still was no electricity there still was no safe drinking water there were still no job opportunities but they came with solutions they didn 't come ready to observe and to adapt based on the community but they didn 't realize that there was so much hunger in that community that when the deaf went to sleep at night and couldn 't hear people broke into their yards and their homes and stole these chickens and goats and eventually they were all gone if that organization had taken the time to observe deaf people to observe the community they would have realized their problem and perhaps lighting up a secure pen to put them in at night to ensure their safety you don 't have to be a design thinker to insert the ideas i 've shared with you today you are a designer everyone is let people like me help you and in the process solve some of the greatest problems"
