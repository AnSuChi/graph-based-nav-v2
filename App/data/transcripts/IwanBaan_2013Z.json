  "transcript": "fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they i think of new cities like dubai or ancient cities like rome with zaha hadid 's incredible maxxi museum or like right here in new york with the high line a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this india the city which has been completely designed by the architect le corbusier like here where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall i 've been documenting rem koolhaas 's cctv building in beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects herzog and de meuron at these large scale construction sites in china you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they 're building over the past seven years i 've been following my fascination with the built environment and for those of you who know me you being constantly on the move like here in new york the day after the sandy storm hit the city and while flying over the city i was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city draped literally all over the mountains the building was under construction until the collapse of the venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early ' 90s about eight years ago people started moving into the abandoned tower there 's only one little entrance together the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower in the lobby they painted the walls and planted trees they also made a basketball but when you look up closely you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through within the tower people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower with no elevators the tower is like walkup designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven 't had any education in architecture or inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by this tower becomes like a living city a place which is alive with the inventive inhabitants for instance find opportunities in the most unexpected cases like the adjacent parking garage which has been reclaimed as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to the apartments a walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create essentially creating a home that 's completely adapted to the conditions of it 's remarkable to see the design decisions that they 're making like when everything is made out of some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish they typically make the best out of their conditions and try to make their spaces look nice and homey or at least up until as far as they can reach reach throughout the tower you come across all kinds of services like the barber small factories and every floor has a little grocery store or shop and and on the 30th floor there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed let 's go now to africa to nigeria to a community called makoko a slum where one hundred and fifty thousand people live just meters above the lagos lagoon while it may appear to be a completely chaotic place when you see it from above there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home when out on the water it 's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific and while makoko seems to be packed with people what 's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building the population growth in nigeria and especially in these areas like makoko are painful reminders of how out of control things really are in makoko very few systems and infrastructures exist electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self built wells throughout the area this so fishing and boat making are common professions there is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or like that hotel in sweden i came across this live band dressed to the t in their coordinating outfits they were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted out generator for all of the community to enjoy by nightfall the area becomes almost pitch black save for a small lightbulb or what originally brought me to makoko was this project from a friend of mine kunl adeyemi who recently finished building this three story floating school for the kids in makoko with this entire village existing on the water public space is so now that the school is finished the ground floor but when classes are out the platform is just like a town square where the fishermen mend their nets another place i 'd like to share with you is the zabbaleen in cairo they 're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper egypt and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over cairo approximately fifty thousand to seventy thousand people who live in this community of houses where up to three generations live in one structure while these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for and the upper floor is dedicated to living space i find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there like this very distinguished man who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him while to most of us living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable to those in the zabbaleen this is just a different type of normal and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation throughout the day it 's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets just like this engagement party in this tradition the bride to be displays all of their belongings which they soon bring to their new husband a gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed and all the garbage is used as as props to display all their new home accessories like makoko and the torre david along with the scores of religious and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops the everything when you step inside you are met with all manner of design decisions despite having limited access to space and money the homes in the area are designed with care and detail and this individuality tells a story about each family 's circumstances and values many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very the shared spaces are also treated in the same manner where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways like this home which caught my attention while all the when i was let in it appeared that this fifth floor apartment was being transformed into a complete animal farm where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room but then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area the attention to this detail astonished me and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment but if it weren 't for the strangely familiar stomach churning odor that constantly passes through the it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill what moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions i was welcomed with open arms let 's move across the map to china to an area called henan and gansu porous loess plateau soil there lived until recently an estimated forty million people in these houses underground these dwellings are called the yaodongs through this architecture by subtraction built literally inside of the soil and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square rectangular houses which sit they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn 't have the money to buy materials and this digging out was their most logical form of living from makoko to zabbaleen created by these very people who live work and play in these particular spaces these neighborhoods are intuitively designed leaving inhabitants with no choice but to and prove that indeed we have the ability to what makes places like the torre david particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into today you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people from china to brazil these projects attempt to provide as many houses the individual needs of the people the founder of the wonderful shorefast foundation based out of fogo island newfoundland she says that there 's this plague of sameness which is killing the human joy and i couldn 't agree with her more"
