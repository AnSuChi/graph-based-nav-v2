  "transcript": "i was born and raised in sierra leone a small and very beautiful country in west africa a country rich both in physical resources and creative rebel war in the ' 90s when entire villages were burnt down as my family and i ran for safety when i was about twelve from one of those attacks i resolved that i would do everything i could to ensure that my own children would not go through the same experiences we had they would in fact be part of a sierra leone where war recover from this devastation one thing that deeply troubled me was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses the reason i would come to find out was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well the prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket prosthetists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create prosthetic sockets leaving them with pressure sores and blisters does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is and that is just simply unacceptable in our age so one day when i met professor hugh herr about two and a half years ago and he asked me if i knew how to solve this problem i said no not yet but i would love to figure it out at the mit media lab i designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and cheaply i used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient 's anatomy then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces and then create a prosthetic socket we use a 3d printer to create a prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient in short we 're using data to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply in a recent trial we just wrapped up at the media lab one of our patients a u s veteran who has been an amputee for about twenty years and worn dozens of legs said of one of our and it 's effing sexy in our age should not prevent anyone from living meaningful lives my hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them for me a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease whether it 's in sierra leone or in boston i hope thank you very much"
