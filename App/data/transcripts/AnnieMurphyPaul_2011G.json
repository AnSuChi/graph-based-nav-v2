  "transcript": "ready now as you ponder that question 're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher well today i want to present to you an idea that may be surprising now i 'm a science reporter i write books and magazine articles and i 'm also a mother and those two roles came together for me in a book that i wrote called origins origins is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fetal origins and it 's based on the theory that our health and well being throughout our lives lives now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me i was myself pregnant while i was doing the research for the book and one of the most fascinating insights i took from this work is that we 're all learning about the world even before we enter it when we hold our unmarked by life when in fact they 've already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in today i want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they 're still in their mothers ' bellies first of all learn the sound of their mothers ' voices starting around the fourth month of gestation are muted and muffled it hears her voice a lot once the baby 's born it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else 's how we know this newborn babies can 't do much but one thing they 're really good at is sucking researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples so that if a baby sucks on one it hears a recording of its mother 's voice on a pair of headphones and if it sucks on the other it hears a recording of a female stranger 's voice scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them and resume their fast sucking when they get bored this is how researchers discovered that after women repeatedly read aloud a section of my favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that of that show once they were learning about the particular language that 's spoken in the world that they 'll be born into a study published last year babies cry in the accent of their mother 's native language french babies cry on a rising note while now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful it even makes its cries sound like the mother 's but it 's not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero it 's also tastes and smells and its olfactory babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they 're out in the world in one experiment a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy while another group of pregnant women drank only water and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it the offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot flavored cereal and from the looks of it they seemed to enjoy it more a sort of french version of this experiment was carried out in dijon france where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with anise and again when they were tested later on their fourth day of life babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they 'll be joining through one of culture 's most powerful expressions which is food they 're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture 's cuisine even before birth turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons but before i get to that i want to address something that you may be wondering about but actually the process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life the air she breathes the food and drink she consumes the chemicals she 's exposed to even the emotions she feels are shared in some fashion with her fetus they make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself makes them part of its flesh and blood and often it does something more it treats these maternal contributions as information as what i like to call biological postcards from the world outside so what a fetus is learning about in utero is not mozart 's magic flute but answers to questions much will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity will it be safe and protected or will it face constant dangers and threats the pregnant woman 's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted the resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus ' brain and other organs are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility our ability to thrive in a huge variety of environments from the country to the city from the tundra to the desert to conclude i want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they 're born in the autumn of one thousand nine hundred and forty four the darkest days of world war ii german troops blockaded western holland the opening of the nazi 's siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades so cold the water in the canals froze solid soon food became scarce with many dutch surviving on just five hundred calories a day a quarter of what they consumed before the war as weeks of deprivation stretched into months some resorted to eating tulip bulbs by the beginning of may the nation 's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted the specter the siege came to a sudden end when holland was liberated by the allies but there was another population that was affected the forty thousand fetuses in utero during the siege but others wouldn 't be discovered for many years decades after the hunger winter researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege have more obesity more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions these individuals ' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance a precursor of diabetes why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later one explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation when food is scarce they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ the brain and away from other organs like the heart and liver this keeps the fetus alive in the short term but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs deprived early on become more susceptible to but that may not be all that 's going on it seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment the fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it and the basis of the fetus ' prediction is what its mother eats the meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation this story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems faced with severely limited resources when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty this is what happened to the children of the dutch hunger winter and their higher rates of obesity diabetes and heart disease are the result bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post war western diet here 's another story there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the world trade center in new york brokers already working the phones on wall street one thousand seven hundred of these people were pregnant women when the planes struck and the towers collapsed many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster the overwhelming chaos and confusion the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris the heart pounding fear for their lives about a year after nine eleven researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world trade center attack in the babies of those women who developed researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to ptsd an effect that was most pronounced the mothers with post traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their but there 's another way of thinking about ptsd what looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances in a particularly environment the characteristic manifestations of ptsd a of one 's surroundings a quick trigger response to danger could save someone 's life the notion that the prenatal transmission of ptsd risk is adaptive it would mean that even before birth are warning their children that it 's a wild world out there telling them be careful let me be clear fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy it 's about discovering how best to promote the health and well being of the next generation that important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they thank you"
