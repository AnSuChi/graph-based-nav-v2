  "transcript": "the recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states and the acta agreement in europe has been very emotional and i think some dispassionate quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate therefore like to propose that we employ we enlist the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject for instance just recently the motion picture association revealed that our economy loses fifty eight billion dollars a year to copyright theft now rather than just argue about this number a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he 'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the and then to mars now this is obviously a powerful some might say dangerously powerful insight but it 's also a morally important one because this isn 't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we 're talking about but this is actual economic losses this is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop rice sorghum whatever sorghum is but identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since napster first came on the scene so that 's a chunk of what so this small missing chunk here is puzzling since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms it 's not additional growth that piracy has prevented but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms one that didn 't exist in the ninety 's what we 're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy which is enough at thirty seconds a ringtone that could stretch from here to neanderthal times it 's true i have excel the movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over three hundred and seventy thousand jobs to content theft which is quite a lot when you consider that back in ' ninety eight the bureau of labor statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing two hundred and seventy thousand people other data has the music industry at about forty five thousand people and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries and this is just one of the many that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day and some people think that string theory is tough hollywood and congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law some people think this number 's a little bit large and it was a big christmas hit because what little hoodlum wouldn 't want a million and a half bucks worth of stolen goods in his pocket these days an ipod classic can hold forty thousand songs which is to say eight billion dollars worth of stolen media or about seventy five thousand jobs now you might find copyright math strange but that 's because it 's a field that 's best left to experts thank you very much"
