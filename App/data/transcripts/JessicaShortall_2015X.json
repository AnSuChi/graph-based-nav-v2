  "transcript": "this is what you 'll be told never mind that this is what you 'll actually produce if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap which as we all know is the hallmark of every american workplace there are thousands of images like these just put the term working mother into any google image search and i 've become kind of obsessed with them as a country we are sending millions of women back to work every year incredibly and kind of horrifically i got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images which look nothing like my life that i recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos that i hoped the world would start to use just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work when your baby 's food source is attached to your body i 'm just going to show you two of them nothing says give that girl a promotion like leaking breast milk through your dress during a presentation you and this will ruin your day that every time a toilet is flushed its contents are aerosolized and they 'll stay airborne for hours i put these things a whole dozen of them into the world i wanted to make a point total strangers from all walks of life write to me all the time just to tell me and not one of them looks anything like this here i returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my a male coworker was annoyed that i had been out on ' vacation ' so he intentionally opened the door on me while i was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway most of the stories that these women total strangers send to me now are not actually even about breastfeeding a woman wrote to me to say i gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks emotionally so i could barely get up sit or walk my employer told me i wasn 't allowed to use my available vacation days because it was budget season i 've come to believe that we can 't look situations like these in the eye because then we be horrified and if we get horrified then we have to do something about it so we choose to look at and believe this image i don 't really know what 's going on in this picture because i find it but this working mother all working mothers and all of their there 's nothing to see here i want to break this choice thing down into two parts the first choice says that women have chosen to work and in forty percent of american households a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner our paid work is part a huge part of the engine of this economy and it is essential for the engines of our families on a national level our paid work is not optional so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices i certainly wasn 't there when that happened but that stance which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional protect our shores make up our tax base our procreation on a national scale is not optional this is pop quiz time what percentage of working women in america do you think have no access to paid maternity leave it exists in america it 's called fmla it does not work because of the way it 's structured all kinds of exceptions half of new mothers are ineligible for it here 's what that looks like i had to take off work i had not been there long enough to qualify for fmla so i wasn 't eligible for unpaid leave i lost my job these corporate stock photos hide another reality another layer of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave most women can 't afford to take much of it at all a nurse told me i didn 't qualify for short term disability because my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition i struggled for months being away from my son so this decision to go back to work so early it 's a rational economic decision but it 's often physically horrific because putting a human into the world is messy i was back at work five weeks postpartum so i waited until six weeks to go back of new working mothers in america will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth i had to return to work before my baby was a month old working sixty hours a week one of my coworkers was only able to afford ten days off with childbirth is and always will be an enormous psychological event a teacher told me but the panic attacks i had prior to returning to work were unbearable statistically speaking the shorter a woman 's leave after having a baby the more likely she will be to suffer from and among many potential consequences of those disorders heads up that this next story i 've never met this woman but i find it hard to get through i feel tremendous grief and rage that i lost an essential labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken colic they said on the inside i was drowning every morning i asked myself how much longer i could do it i was allowed to bring my baby to work i closed my office door while i rocked and shushed and begged him to stop screaming so i wouldn 't get in trouble i cried in the bathroom while i washed out the pump equipment every day i cried all the way to work and all the way home again i promised my boss that the work i didn 't get done during the day i 'd make up at night from home i thought there 's just something wrong with me that i can 't swing this so those are the mothers i say we don 't we tell them we 'll see them in eighteen years and getting there is kind of on them one of the reasons i know this is that so those babies but those things are hidden behind images like this whatever time you get together and you 're an inconvenience to the economy and to your employers that narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories i hear a woman told me i went back at eight weeks after my c section because my husband was out of work thankfully my four times a shift so i could nurse her there 's a little club of countries in the world that offer no national paid leave to new mothers care to guess who they are the first eight make up eight million in total population marshall islands niue palau and tonga number nine is the united states of america with three hundred and twenty million people that 's it that 's the end of the list every other economy on the planet has found a way to make some level of national paid leave work for the people doing the work of the future of those countries but we say we couldn 't possibly do that and then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women who are already the highest educated and highest paid among us remember that eighty eight percent those middle and low income women are not going to participate in that physical and emotional we have decided but it 's also to america 's risk what would happen if all of these individual so called choices to have babies started to turn into individual choices it shouldn 't be traumatic if we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first we might stick with one kid the birthrate needed in america to keep the population stable is two point one live births per woman and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that what would happen to work force to innovation to gdp i 'm here today and you 've guessed what it is it is long since time for the most powerful country on earth childbirth is a public good this leave should be i 've talked today a lot about mothers but co parents matter on so many levels not one more woman should have to go back to while she is hobbling and bleeding not one more family should have to drain their savings account to buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding not one more fragile infant should have to go directly from the incubator to day care because his parents have used up all of their meager time sitting in the nicu not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work their needed work and their needed parenthood is their problem alone the catch is that when this is happening to a new family it is consuming i am done and you this is an american issue we need to stop being comforted by them we need to recognize that this american reality to our dishonor and to our peril because this is not this is not and this is not what a working mother looks like"
