  "transcript": "but well before my imagination was my vocation my imagination saved my life when i was a kid i loved to draw and the most talented artist i knew and when when your parent is a drug addict it 's kind of like charlie brown trying to kick the football because as much as you want to love on that person as much as you want to receive love from that person every time you open your heart you end up on your back so throughout my childhood my mother was incarcerated but i had my grandparents my maternal grandparents joseph and shirley who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own after they had already raised five children so two people who grew up in the great depression i was the cousin oliver of the sitcom of the krosoczka family and i would like to say that life was totally easy with them they each smoked two packs a day each nonfiltered and by the time i was six i could order a southern comfort manhattan dry with a twist rocks on the side but here was this kid who loved transformers and snoopy and the characters so my best friends in life were the characters i read about in books and i can just remember the love that she offered us as her students when i was in the third grade a we all went back to our classrooms and we drew our own renditions of his main character and he tapped on my desk and he said nice cat and he wandered away two words that made a colossal difference in my life when i was in the third grade i wrote a book for the first time the owl who thought he was the best flyer we had to write our own greek myth and the owl cheated and hermes being a greek god grew angry and bitter and turned the owl into a moon so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon while he watched his family and friends play at night i was clearly worried about my intellectual property when i was eight and i sometimes let the words have the stage on their own and sometimes i allowed the pictures to my favorite page is the about the author page so i learned to write about myself in third person at a young age so i love that last sentence he liked making this book and i liked making that book because i and i do get so scared because i travel to so many schools now and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids that writing would be using your imagination on paper and i would fill those blank pages with words and pictures just because i loved using my imagination and and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender who tried to chop them up an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of butter and this was another way for me to tell stories through words and through pictures the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the worcester public school system i went from having art once a week to twice a month to once a month i had art and he said jarrett it 's up to you but if you 'd like to we 'd like to send you to the classes at the worcester art museum and i was so thrilled so from sixth and i was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw other kids who shared a similar passion and if you 're wondering about the style of dress i put our mascot in i was really into bell biv devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time don 't tempt me because i will do it he wanted me to go to a private school and he gave me an option which is all boys but i took solace just flourished here i drew funny pictures of my teachers and i passed them around my friend john who was sitting next to me laughed a little bit too instantly saw that i was i was sent to the hall and i thought oh no i 'm doomed my grandfather 's just going to kill me and he came out to the hallway and he said let me see the paper and he said to me you 're really talented you know the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist and you should be the cartoonist just stop drawing in my class i was introduced to mrs casey who ran the school and i was for for three and a half years the cartoonist handling such heavy issues as seniors are mean freshmen i can 't believe how much it costs to go and i took the headmaster to task and then i also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named wesley and they 'd be published in the school paper and people who i didn 't know could read them and i loved that thought of being able to share my ideas through the printed page on my 14th birthday my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever a drafting table and i still work on this table every day on the evening of my 14th birthday and this was my fortune you will be successful in your work i taped it to the top left hand of my table and as you can see it 's still there now i never really asked my grandparents for anything well two things rusty who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when i was in fourth grade video camera and i instantly started making my own animations on my own and all throughout high school i made my own animations i convinced my 10th grade english teacher to allow me to do my book report on stephen king 's misery as an animated short laughter and i kept making comics i kept making comics and at the worcester art museum i was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator i was ever given mark lynch and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course excited i was beaming i had this book that was how to draw comics in the marvel way and it taught me how to draw superheroes how to draw a woman how to draw muscles just the way they were supposed to be if i were to ever draw for x men or spiderman and he looked at me and he said forget everything you i didn 't understand he said you have a great style celebrate your own style don 't draw the way you 're being told to draw draw the way you 're drawing and keep at it because you 're really good i was and when i was seventeen i met my father for the first time upon which i learned i had a brother and sister i had never known about my one and only choice for college and this kid eric changed my life eric didn 't live to see his sixth birthday and eric lives with me every day so after this experience my art teacher mr shilale he brought in these picture books and i thought picture books for kids and i started writing books for young readers and it was there that i took every course that i could on writing but i was also involved with the hole in the wall gang camp i graduated from risd my grandparents were and i set up shop i set up a studio and i tried to get published i would send out my books i would send out hundreds of postcards to editors and art directors but they would go unanswered and my grandfather would call me every week and he would say jarrett how 's it going do you have a job yet job i write and illustrate children 's books and he said well who pays you for that and i said no one no one no one just yet but i know it 's going to happen now i used to work the weekends at the hole in the wall off season programming to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off the ground and this kid who was just this really hyper kid i started calling him monkey boy and i went home and wrote a book called and i received an email from an editor at random house with a subject line nice work exclamation point dear jarrett i received your postcard i liked your art so i went to your website and i 'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories because please let me know if you 're ever in new york city and this was from an editor at random house children 's books so the next week i happened to be in new york and i left new york two thousand and one and my local paper celebrated the news the local bookstore made a big deal of it my grandparents they were in the middle of it they were so happy they couldn 't have been more alisch was there mr shilale was there mrs casey was there mrs alisch cut in front of the line and said i taught him how to read i got my first piece of significant fan mail where this kid loved monkey boy so much that he wanted to have a monkey boy birthday cake for a two year old that is like a tattoo you and for him it 's only his second he will forever have this photo in his family photo albums so that photo since that moment is framed in front of me while i 've worked on all of my books i have ten picture books out in the lunch lady series which is a graphic novel series about a lunch lady who fights crime i 'm expecting the release of a chapter book called platypus police squad the frog who croaked letting lots of kids know and i meet lunch ladies treat me really well and and those winners were displayed on a jumbotron screen in times square punk farm are in development to be movies so i am a movie producer thanks to that video camera i was given in ninth grade i 've seen people have punk farm birthday parties people have dressed up as punk farm for halloween a punk farm baby room which makes me a little nervous for the child 's well being in the long term and i get the most amazing projects and the biggest moment for me came last halloween it was so cool now so to honor them i started a scholarship at the worcester art museum are in difficult situations but whose caretakers can 't afford the classes and it displayed the work my first ten years of publishing and you know who was there to celebrate"
