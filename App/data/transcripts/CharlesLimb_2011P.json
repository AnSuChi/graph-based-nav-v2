  "transcript": "we don 't really think of but that 's probably why our senses really evolved to keep us safe to allow us to live really when we think of our senses or when we think of the loss of the sense we really think about something more like this the ability to touch something luxurious to taste something delicious to smell something fragrant to see something beautiful and when it comes to sensory restoration we 're still very far away from being able to provide beauty we don 't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren although clearly that 's an important thing really what we want to hear is music now i 'd like to impress upon you how unusual it is that we can hear music music is just one of the strangest things that there is it 's acoustic vibrations in the air little waves of energy in the air that tickle our somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music that process is entirely abstract and very very unusual we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out how is it that we hear something that 's emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air turns out that if you have hearing loss most people that lose their hearing lose it now if you had to pick a sense to lose i have to be very honest with you and say we 're better at restoring i 'd just be plainly heartbroken because i know that music would never sound the same to me she 's in a very supportive environment her mother 's doing everything she can okay play that video please now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple infused learning i 'm not saying that they can i 'm saying that they 're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past ear shaped objects onto your ears which is an outpatient procedure it 's surgically placed but and this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor dr john niparko who implanted her if we could play this video please deaf do you remember writing that chapter however despite this incredible facility that some you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can 't hear music almost at all in fact most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so we have a long way to go when it comes to audition semantic specificity you don 't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken if it doesn 't sound good what 's the point there 's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn 't sound good to you the acoustics of music are much harder than those of language and you can see on this figure that the frequency range and the what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission now the problems begin first with pitch perception i mean most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music and without the ability to perceive pitch well music and melody is a very difficult thing to do forget about a harmony and things like that now this is a midi arrangement of rachmaninoff 's prelude now if we could just play this if we consider that in a cochlear implant patient pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves let 's see what happens here when we randomize this to within one semitone we would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users and it it might be that you kind of like that now the other issue comes with not just the ability to tell pitches apart but the ability to tell sounds most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument if we could play these two sound clips in succession the trumpet and the second one that 's tone color they you would think that because these but actually if you look at melody what you find is that there 's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls now we 've been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound is like for these implant users i 'm going to play you two clips of usher one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies go ahead and play that i had patients tell me that those sound the same they cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips again there is hope now i don 't know if anybody knows who this is this is does somebody know this is beethoven now why would we know what beethoven 's skull looks like because his grave was exhumed and turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there the capacity for music remains i 've been very lucky to work with dr david ryugo where i 've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants this is a cat that 's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food i 'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we 're hearing it i 'm suggesting that with training you can imbue a musical sound with significance even in a cat if we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music because right now there 's virtually no effort put towards that now i want to show you one last video and this is of a student of mine and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant and here 's a video of joseph although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at and this is really unheard of stuff and this is all because of this technology because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time you don 't actually have to hear it i know he doesn 't hear well because i 've heard him do karaoke and it 's one of the most awful things heartwarming but awful and so there is certainly a lot of hope but there 's a lot more that needs to be done so i just want to conclude with the following words you would want perfect hearing back but it 's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty where we can get inspiring and i don 't think that we should give up on beauty and i want to thank you for your time"
