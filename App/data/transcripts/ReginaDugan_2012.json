  "transcript": "i 'd go so far as to say if you don 't already have a nerd in your life you should get one scientists and engineers change the world because when you remove the fear of impossible things suddenly become possible if you want to know how ask yourself this question you can 't help but feel uncomfortable i feel a little uncomfortable because when you ask it you begin to how it keeps us from attempting great things and life gets dull now i should be clear because it 's not failure itself that constrains us the path to truly new and in part that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great because it 's a sign that we 've surpassed ourselves and two months later on december orville wright powered the first airplane across a beach in north carolina the flight lasted twelve seconds and covered one year later the next declarations of impossibilities began ferdinand foch a french army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the french army but of no military value aero experts coined the term they debated should it have one s or two and it wasn 't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound in one thousand nine there was no wind tunnel data beyond mach and in so doing he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound it took a lot of failures to get there since we took to the sky we have wanted to fly faster and farther that 's still true today we talk about flying hypersonically not mach two or mach three mach twenty at mach twenty we can fly from new york to long beach in eleven minutes and twenty seconds the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel three thousand five hundred degrees fahrenheit like a blast furnace we are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it and we are flying it or trying to it 's boosted so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an eighty nine degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory that 's an unnatural act for a rocket and it 's pointed at the hypersonic glider this is the actual but this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider but we collected more hypersonic flight data than in thirty years of ground based testing combined and in the second flight three minutes of we must fly maneuverability is a very close second if a mach twenty glider takes eleven minutes and twenty seconds to get from new york to long a hummingbird would take well days even and so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can 't go we 'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so it can hover and rotate this prototype aircraft it weighs it does not eat nectar in two thousand and eight it flew for a whopping twenty seconds a year later two minutes then six eventually eleven many prototypes crashed but there 's no way to learn to fly like a matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot failure is part of creating we cannot both fear failure or maybe even ice a robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human or perhaps spider man will one day be gecko man a gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe one square millimeter of a gecko 's footpad has fourteen thousand hair like structures called setae today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko 's foot the result that 's enough to stick six 42 inch plasma tv 's to your wall no nails and it 's not just passive structures it 's entire it 's one millimeter long but it looks like godzilla next to these micromachines each one fifth the diameter of a human hair so that we can watch movies like today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air so light that you can make a car that two people can lift but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an suv from the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature 's storms each electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains using a grid the size of your thumb with thirty two electrodes on the surface of his brain tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm and his thoughts made him reach for katie this is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone and it is the first time that tim has held katie 's hand in seven years that moment mattered to tim and katie this green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life it was made in tobacco plants and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever and if it seems far fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can 't solve the gamers of foldit three dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to aids in rhesus monkeys now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments for fifteen years it was unsolved and others it allows us to contribute it allows us to amplify but it too the internet was but a dream a few sketches on a piece of paper ucla to sri the first two letters of the word login that 's all that made it through an l and an o and then a buffer overflow crashed the system o now a worldwide force so who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called darpa and they are heroes among us they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions they remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible they remind us that we all have there was a time when you weren 't afraid of failure when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing you were good at math you could build things you were an astronaut you believed in impossible things and you were fearless you were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero scientists and engineers you were born to so go ahead ask yourself what would you attempt to do it 's hard to hold onto this feeling really hard i guess in some way i sort of believe it 's supposed to be hard and if we 're lucky in that moment someone steps into that doubt and fear takes a hand and says let me help you believe jason started at darpa on march 18th two thousand and ten he with our transportation team and on one jason sat down and he wrote an email in that moment and still today when i doubt when i feel afraid when i need to reconnect they were so powerful there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you and remember be nice to nerds what happened on that second flight yeah it also went into the pacific we didn 't fly it into the pacific and so in the second flight we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it ca i imagine you 're not planning to open up to passenger service from new york to long beach anytime soon rd it might be a little warm ca what do you picture that glider being used for rd well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this how it 's ultimately used will be determined by the the purpose of the vehicle though the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than sixty minutes ca and to carry a payload of more than a few pounds like what 's the payload it could carry rd you started your beautiful sequence on flight with with a and there haven 't been that many planes built since that flap why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird isn 't that a very expensive solution for a small we wondered if it was possible to do it and you have to revisit these questions over time the folks at aerovironment tried three hundred or more different wing designs twelve different forms of the avionics but there 's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something but when things looks just natural you also don 't see them my headquarters technology catches up so quick how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies one through a window of the white house i mean do you worry about the pandora 's box issue here that 's what we do it would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn 't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time now our responsibility is to push that edge and we have to be of it 's advancing ca i mean you 're clearly a really inspiring leader and you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention but at a personal can 't imagine doing your job do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of of your team 's brilliance rd i think you couldn 't be human if you didn 't ask those questions ca how do you answer them rd i think that my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have i work with some of the most amazing people and and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of thank you so much for coming to"
