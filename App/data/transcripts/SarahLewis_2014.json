  "transcript": "i feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the museum of modern art on a retrospective of painter elizabeth murray i learned so much from her after the curator robert storr selected all the paintings from her lifetime body of work i loved looking at the paintings from the there were some motifs and i remember asking her what she thought of those early works if you didn 't know they were hers you might not have been able to guess she told me that a few didn 't quite meet her own mark for what she wanted them to be one of the and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value but what we 're always celebrating but this is the thing what gets us to convert success into mastery this is a question i 've long asked myself i think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win i started to understand this when i went on one cold may day to watch a set of varsity i wanted to see what 's called archer 's paradox you have to aim at something slightly skew from it i stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van and they this kind of relaxed focus one held a half eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching and i stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support and watched her and i didn understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring and this is while holding fifty pounds of draw weight on each shot she first hit a seven i remember and then a nine and i saw that gave her more tenacity and she went after it again and again for three hours this went on at the end of the practice one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just it 's so rare in american culture there 's so little that 's vocational about it anymore to look at what doggedness looks like with this level of exactitude but i stayed because i realized i was witnessing what 's so rare to glimpse that difference between success and mastery but mastery is knowing that it means nothing if you can 't do it again and again and a label that the world confers upon you mastery is not a commitment to a goal but to a constant pursuit what gets us to do this what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win riddled with difficulties and flaws in other words a near win elizabeth murray surprised me with her admission about her earlier paintings but at the end of his life the result was that he had only signed ten percent of his paintings by honor de balzac and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself franz kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise so much so that he wanted all of his diaries manuscripts letters and even sketches burned upon his death and because of that grant that i desire more than i can accomplish michelangelo implored as if to that old testament god on the sistine chapel and he himself was that adam with his finger outstretched and not quite touching that god 's hand mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career how many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon we thrive when it 's a wisdom understood by duke ellington who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire was always the next one part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is because the greater our proficiency the more clearly we might see that we don 't know all that we thought the paris review got it out of james baldwin when they asked him what do you think increases with knowledge and he said you learn how little you know success motivates us but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest one of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition gilovich and his team from cornell studied this difference and found that the frustration silver medalists feel compared to bronze who are typically a bit more happy to have just not received fourth place and not medaled at all we see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win and created these that had a higher than average rate of near wins heart stoppers and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses in britain in the the reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape into more proximate to where we stand and this is what a near win does it gets us to focus on what right now we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights thousand two hundred and ninety one points a score that no athlete has come very close to since we thrive not when we 've done it all but when we still have more to do i stand here thinking and wondering about all the different ways that we might even manufacture a near win in this room how your lives might play this out because i think on some gut level we we do know this we know that we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge and it 's why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths in navajo culture some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics it masters are not experts because they take a subject to its conceptual end they 're masters because they realize that there isn 't one now it occurred to me as i thought about this why the archery coach told me at the end of that practice out of earshot of his archers that he and his colleagues never feel they can do enough for their team never feel there are enough visualization techniques and posture drills but just a way to let me know a kind of tender admission to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over to a voracious unfinished path that always required more we build out of the unfinished idea even if that idea is our former self it 's what i have to imagine elizabeth murray was thinking when i saw her smiling at those early paintings one day in the galleries even if we created utopias thank you"
