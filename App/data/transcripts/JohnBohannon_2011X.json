  "transcript": "good afternoon as you 're all aware we face difficult economic times i come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden this idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at mit he was struggling to explain near the speed of light all of them are different colors and that 's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here now a laser is different and if you focus them into a beam what you have is an incredibly useful the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down little by little it gets colder the atoms and that 's what gives superfluids such it is able to slow photons down to sixty kilometers per hour it won 't stay inside flow over the top it immediately turns back into normal matter but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people i still barely understand what most scientists are talking about so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment it seemed like the fewer words you use the better in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all i remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers i started a contest four years ago called dance your ph d instead of explaining their research with words scientists have to explain it with dance it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand but don 't take my word for it go on the internet and search for dance your of dancing scientists waiting for you the most surprising thing that i 've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research there 's a biomedical engineer named david odde and he works with dancers to study how cells move it triggers the cell to expand its but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside but just as quickly as they explode more proteins it 's basically efficient brainstorming and when i visited david to learn about his research he used dancers to explain it to me and this brings me to my modest proposal i think that bad powerpoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time and given that there are some apparently thirty million powerpoint presentations created every day that would indeed add up to an annual waste of one hundred billion dollars of course that 's just the time we 're losing sitting through presentations it helps you to soften up your audience it distracts them with pretty pictures so now my country is fifteen trillion dollars in debt our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts once we eliminate public there will be some drawbacks the artists on the street will swell and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods once we eliminate public funding for the artists let 's put them back to work by using them instead of powerpoint i propose we start with american dancers after all they are the most perishable of their kind prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our health care system rather than imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country it 's sure to help that you can perform"
