  "transcript": "so small it 's a single word the word is misfit it i mean it 's a person who sort of missed fitting in or a person who fits in badly or this a person who is poorly adapted to new situations and environments and i 'm here for the other misfits in the room because i 'm never the only one i 'm going to tell you a misfit story actually it came to my mailbox in the form of a letter that said i 'd won a giant literary prize for a short story i had written the short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer and a little bit about how grief and loss so kind of it was the wannabe writer 's dream right because i 'm me i put the letter on my kitchen table i poured myself a giant glass of vodka and i sat there in my underwear for an entire day just staring at the letter i was thinking about all the ways i 'd already screwed my life up who the hell was i to go to new york city and pretend to be a writer who was i like legions of other children i already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt i 'd flunked out of college not once but twice and maybe even a third time that i 'm not going to tell you about and i 'd had two lovely staycations in jail so i 'm on the right stage laughter but and i hadn 't figured out how to live with that story yet after my daughter died i also spent a long time homeless living under an overpass in a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss that some of us encounter along the way you know homeless people are some of our most heroic misfits because they start out as us so you see i 'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there and the dream of being a writer was really kind of like a small sad stone in my throat where the writers are i can almost see your heads glowing i can pick you out of a room at first you would 've loved it you got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet and these guys went and found them for you you got set up at the gramercy where you got to drink scotch late in the night with cool smart swank people and you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank too and you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents at very very fancy lunches and dinners ask me how fancy audience how fancy lidia i 'm making a confession i stole three linen napkins and i shoved a menu down my pants you know the three writers i wanted to meet were carole maso lynne tillman and peggy phelan these were not famous best selling authors but to me they were lynne tillman gave me permission to believe that there was a chance my stories could be part of the world and peggy phelan reminded me that maybe my brains could be more important than my mainstream women writers but they were cutting a path through the mainstream with their body stories and the reason it nearly killed me with joy never known a joy like that i 'd never been in a room like that my mother never went to college sad stillborn thing this is beautiful some of you in the room will understand happened next first they took me to the offices of farrar straus and giroux farrar straus and giroux was like my mega dream press i mean t s eliot and flannery o 'connor were published there the main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time trying to convince me i had a book in me the whole time he was talking to me i sat there smiling and nodding like a numb idiot with my arms crossed over my chest while nothing nothing nothing so in the end he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might and he wished me luck and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door but that didn 't happen being at the norton offices felt like reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon while the stars stitched your name across leaned over right in my face with these bright fierce eyes and said well send me something then immediately see now most people especially ted people would have run to the mailbox right it took me over a decade to even imagine putting something in an envelope and licking a stamp on the last night i gave a big reading at the national poetry club & picard literary agency walked straight up to me and shook my hand and offered me representation like on the spot has this ever happened to you and i almost started crying because all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully i have to think about it and she said ok then and walked away all those open hands out to me that small you see i 'm trying to tell you something about people like me it 's the it 's the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room if i could i 'd go back and i 'd coach myself i 'd be exactly like those over 50 year old women who helped me i 'd teach myself how to want things how to stand up how to ask for them i 'd say yeah you and we i flew back to oregon and as i watched the evergreens and rain i just drank many tiny bottles of airplane feel sorry for yourself i was some kind of misfit writer what i 'm saying is i flew back to oregon without a book deal without an agent and with only a and heart ful of memories of having sat so near the beautiful and yet at home in the dark back in my underwear i could still hear their voices don 't listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up or change your story they said give voice to the story only you know how to tell they said sometimes telling the story is the thing that saves your life and i became a teacher guess who my favorite students are called the chronology of water the stories of how my seeming failures were really just all i had to do was give voice to the story but i prefer a different myth that 's slightly to the side of that or underneath you can be an ex con you can even lose your marbles you can be standing dead center i 'm only here to tell you you are so beautiful because you you rare and phenomenal misfit you new species are the only one in the room and i 'd be listening"
