  "transcript": "as a little girl i always imagined i would one day run away from the age of six on i kept a packed bag with some clothes and cans of food tucked away in the back of a closet there was a deep restlessness in me a primal fear that i would fall prey to a life of routine and boredom and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders forage for berries years have passed but many of the adventures i fantasized about as a child traveling and weaving my way between worlds other than my own have become but no other experience has felt as true to my childhood dreams as living amongst and documenting the lives of fellow wanderers across the united states this is the nomadic dream a different kind of american dream lived by young hobos travelers hitchhikers vagrants and tramps in most of our minds the vagabond is a creature from the past the word hobo conjures up an old black and white image of a weathered old man covered in coal legs dangling out of a boxcar but these photographs are in color seeing sides of america that no one else gets to see like their predecessors today 's nomads travel the steel and asphalt arteries of the united states by day they hop freight trains stick out their thumbs and ride the highways with anyone from truckers to soccer moms by night they sleep beneath the cats and pet rats between their bodies renouncing materialism traditional jobs and university degrees in exchange for a glimmer of adventure others come from the underbelly of society teenage runaways escaping abuse and unforgiving homes where others they 'd rather live off of the excess of what they view as a wasteful consumer society they take advantage of the fact that in the united states up to forty percent of all food ends up in the garbage they sacrifice material comforts in exchange for the space but there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic no addiction is real the elements are real freight trains maim and kill and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest to the exhaustive list of laws that criminalize homeless existence who here knows that in many cities across the united states it is now illegal to sit on the sidewalk to wrap oneself in a blanket to sleep in your own car to offer food to a stranger i know about these laws because i 've watched as friends and other travelers were hauled off to jail or received citations for committing these so called crimes many of you might be wondering why anyone would choose a life like this under the thumb of discriminatory laws eating out of trash cans sleeping under bridges picking up seasonal jobs here and there until we live in a society where every human is assured dignity in their labor so that they can work to live well not only work to survive there will always be an element of those who seek the open road as a means of escape of liberation and of course of rebellion thank you"
