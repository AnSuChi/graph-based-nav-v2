  "transcript": "i am very very happy to be amidst some of the most the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they 're reflecting on my glasses i am very happy and honored to be amidst and guess what happened and it looks and sounds like i have nothing else to say but there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something that bud is a young one so i will since i am not young i still will say something g8 summit g8 summit proposes that the solution to africa 's problems should be a massive increase in aid i personally do not believe in the marshall plan one because the benefits of the marshall plan have been overstated its largest recipients were germany and france and it was only two point five percent of their gdp an average african country receives foreign aid to the tune fifteen percent of its gdp how the media covers africa in the west and the consequences of that and nothing but the truth and secondly they are the smallest reality we have civil wars only which means that the media are covering only six countries africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness it appeals to something called charity as a consequence the western view of africa 's economic dilemma is framed wrongly the wrong framing is a product of thinking that africa is a place of despair what should we do with it and in the process africa has been stripped of we need to reframe the challenge that is facing africa from a challenge of despair despair which is called and that is worth creation the challenge facing all those who are interested in africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty it should be a challenge of creating once we change those two things if you say the africans are poor and they need poverty reduction you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent with what medicines for the poor and none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms not the causes of africa 's fundamental problems sending somebody to school and giving them medicines ladies and does not create wealth for them wealth is a function of income and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well paying job [ unclear ] told us they are always about four percent of the population but sixteen percent are imitators so where should we be putting the money we need to put money where it can productively grow support private because knowledge is an important but what is the international aid community doing with africa today the entire continent has been turned into a place of despair in need of charity ladies and gentlemen can any one of you tell me a neighbor a friend a relative that you know who became rich by holding the begging bowl and receiving alms does any one of you in the audience have that person does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another well since i 'm not seeing the hand it appears that what i 'm stating is true me tell you this external actors can only present to you an opportunity the ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity under the cotonou agreement formerly known as the lome convention african countries have been given an opportunity by europe to export goods duty free to the european union market my own country uganda a quota to export fifty thousand metric tons we import fifty thousand metric tons of sugar from brazil and under the beef protocol of that agreement african countries that produce beef have quotas i want to argue today that the the fundamental source of africa 's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy how do we begin to do that and why is aid the bad instrument aid is the bad instrument and do you know why because all governments across the world need money to survive money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order you have to pay the army and the police to show law and order and because many of our governments are quite dictatorial the second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers on why should people support their government well because it gives them good paying jobs the fact is no government in the world with the exception of a few like that of idi amin can seek to depend entirely governments often need build hospitals and clinics such a government is driven by it will sit with those who create wealth talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary the productive rather than sit with ugandan south african enterprising leaders our governments find it more i can tell you even if you have ten ph ds you can never beat bill gates in understanding because the knowledge the private sector actors in that industry governments in africa and therefore allowed and then it is the imf and the world bank that tell them what its citizens need in the process we the african we have limited input because he who pays the piper calls the tune the imf the world bank and the cartel of good intentions in the world because they depend on aid is to listen and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive some aid may have built a hospital the mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success generalize them and then spread them across the whole world ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed and that makes by increasing the political attractiveness of the state especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in africa aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every now begins struggling the most enterprising people in africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business governments are not changing it why because i also want to say that it is important for us to note africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community in the form between one thousand nine hundred and sixty and two thousand and three our continent received six hundred billion dollars of aid i want to use the example of my own country called uganda and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there budget expected revenue two point five trillion shillings the expected foreign aid one point nine trillion uganda 's recurrent expenditure why does the government of uganda budget it 's because there 's somebody there called foreign aid who contributes for it but this shows you that the government of uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure public administration which is largely patronage takes only eighteen billion trade and industry and let me show you what does public expenditure public administration expenditure in uganda constitute by the way who never see the president except on television and even there it is him who advises them and so many jobs for the political hangers on he had to create twenty five new government bodies all of which have directors and the cars and the final thing this is addressed to mr bono in his work he may help us on this a recent government of uganda study found that there are three thousand drive motor vehicles at the minister of health headquarters uganda has nine hundred and sixty one sub counties the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects while the poor die without ambulances i want to say that before i came to speak here i was told but long enough to cover the subject i hope i have achieved"
