  "transcript": "things happen at intersections in fact i would argue that some of the most interesting things of the human experience occur at the intersections in the liminal space some of the great intersections of the world come to mind like the arc de triomphe in paris or times square in new york city both bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people also come to mind because of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings beyond the physical landscape of our planet some of the most famous celestial images are of stars die by this same intersection this time flung outward in a violent collision of smaller atoms intersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things we can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us to be is to occupy a position at an intersection i 've lived the entirety of my life in the in between race and gender and plenty science and society i am both black and a woman blazars supermassive hyperactive black holes that sit at the centers of massive galaxies and shoot out jets nearby those black holes at speeds approaching the speed of light in a process we are still trying to completely understand according to dr jamie alexander 's archive of black women in the united states had ever earned a phd in a physics related discipline and that the first black woman to graduate with a phd in field did so just one year before my birth i encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection the tremendous opportunity to of expectation and experience i began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart our financial situation disintegrated just after my father 's departure from our lives this thrust my mother my sister and i out of the relative comfort of middle class life norfolk state university provided me with full funding and i was able to achieve my bachelor 's in physics after graduation and despite knowing that i wanted a phd in astrophysics i fell through the cracks it was striking to me because it featured a young black girl i remember thinking which to this day still hangs in my office i described to them in the email my educational path and my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the phd fisk vanderbilt university bridge program itself an intersection of the master 's and phd degrees at two institutions after two years out of school they accepted me into the program and i found myself again on the path to the phd once i was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations i anticipated a smooth glide to the phd it became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality in their space i was ostracized by many of my classmates one of whom went so far as to invite me to this is something they have long endured one hundred percent of the sixty women of color interviewed in a recent study by joan c williams at uc hastings reported facing racialized including being mistaken for the janitorial staff while there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college because many of their parents worked these jobs while there was certainly the acute pain of the the real issue is that my appearance can tell anyone anything about my ability beyond that though it underscores that the women of color in stem do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face that 's why today i want to highlight women of color in stem who are as the inseparable sum of identities such that its true richness cannot be appreciated without considering the liminal space between disciplines the pursuit of understanding the physical world by way of chemistry physics biology engineering requires the application of technology sits firmly on the foundation of math engineering and science math itself serves the critical role of rosetta stone decoding and encoding the physical principles of the world stem is utterly the purpose for this talk is twofold indigenous first nation or any other woman or girl who finds herself resting at the blessed intersection of race and gender that you can be anything you want to be but beyond that anything you want do not think for one minute that because you are who you are you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can 't even imagine secondly among the most pressing issues of our time most now find their intersection with stem those that remain require a thorough investigation of the liminal space between disciplines to create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow who better to solve these those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections we as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity dr claudia alexander a black woman plasma physicist who passed away this past july after a 10 year bout with breast cancer which became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet and the one point five billion dollar galileo mission to jupiter and the world dr alexander said it this way i 'm used to walking between two cultures for me it 's among the purposes of my life to take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding with bold exploration that you can 't do every day this shows exactly and she perfectly understood her place of being exactly who she was in any place she was jessica matthews inventor of the soccket line of sports products like soccer balls that generate renewable energy as you play with them said it this way a major part of invention isn 't just creating things people and understanding the systems that make this world intersectional stories the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race gender and innovation despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be i 'm proud to report that when i graduated i was the first black woman to earn a phd in astrophysics in yale 's then i am now part of a small but growing cadre of women of color in stem who are poised to bring new perspectives and new ideas to life on the most pressing issues of our time this is to say nothing of the things we haven 't even thought of yet women of color in stem occupy some of the toughest and most exciting we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience positive and this is not a request born out of a desire to fit in it 's a reminder that we cannot get to the best possible outcomes for the totality of humanity this bringing together of the liminal the differently lived thank you"
