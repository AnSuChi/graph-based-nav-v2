  "transcript": "brain magic what 's brain magic all about brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind reading effects so unlike traditional magic it uses the power of words linguistic deception non verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense i want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody i want everybody to put out your hands like this for me first of all ok clap them together once why is that ok swap them around put your right hand up extend your fingers like this for me if you did not allow me to deceive your minds you would all be able to do this now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind once you know how now i remember when i was about fifteen 75 year old blind russian woman who could sense printed letters there 's and even sense colors just by touch and she was completely blind she could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed face down on a hard surface but at the same time skeptical how could somebody read using their fingertips if somebody is totally blind a guy yesterday did a demonstration where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things let 's take expert can see through somebody else 's eyes i 'm trying to see through your eyes we were going to film this down there at the race but halfway through the drive he told me he had i think it was a nine millimeter stuck to his leg so i stopped pretty quick and that was it ok want you to just think about it for a moment a lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened all right but because your brains are not trained in the art of deception the solutions you come up with will ninety nine percent of the time be way off the mark then i look at it and let 's see ok give them a round of applause as they come up you might want to use the stairs there it 's very important for everybody here to realize i haven 't set anything up with you you don 't know what your name is i want you to just stand exactly like this for me pull up your sleeves if you don 't mind ok now i want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you because we 'll try a voodoo experiment i but don 't say anything until i ask you and don 't open do not say anything do not open them be aware of the sensations yes or no did you feel anything nicole yes kb you did feel that what did you feel extend your left arm out in front of you extend your left arm ok ok be aware of the sensations don 't say anything don 't open your eyes ok did can you show us where and i just touched his arm a voodoo experiment yeah i walk around nightclubs all night like this you just take a seat over here for a second i 'm going to use you again in a moment can you take a seat right over here if you don 't mind sit right here man and relax allow your eyes to close on five four three two one close your eyes right now ok now i 'm not i 'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity so our minds are along the same lines and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness and allow it to go i want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop ok now allow it to stay there and i want you to be aware of the pressure just be aware of the only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release but only when you feel the pressure release do you understand just answer yes or no man yes kb hold it right there and only when you feel the pressure go back allow your hand to drift back to the now that you 've got the idea let 's try something even more interesting allow to stick firmly to the tabletop keep your eyes closed can you stand up imagine a connection between you and him but only when you want the pressure only when you want the pressure to go back make a downward gesture you can wait as long as you want when i snap my fingers your eyes will open again most people ask you what the hell just happened up here but it 's ok that even though you 're not hypnotized you will forget everything that happened on five four three two one open your eyes and it didn 't break now it 's nearly impossible to break a coke bottle you see psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes sometimes the object will slide across the table sometimes it will not it depends on how much energy you have that day so on and so come right over here next to me i want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb excellent now i 've got a shard of glass here i want you to imagine right now i want you to imagine think of that guy that ba that guy i 'm and when you feel the sensation it might take a while drop it into the glass ok drop it in now imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side how many letters in the title of his name there 's five letters in the title you didn 't react to that so it 's four letters think of one of the letters in the title there 's a k in his name there is a k i knew that because my name starts with a k also but his name doesn 't start with a k it starts with an m tell mike i said hello the next time you see him was that his name chris i was going to pick you for this but instead of picking you can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment i was going to use you but i decided i might want to come back another year ca well to reward him for saying eureka and for selecting michael mercil to come and talk to us steve jurvetson they insist that because i was a magician put a nice black tablecloth on there you are ok one two three and four now they 're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it i want you to examine it and make sure it 's solid so nobody has any idea where the spike is all right sj no one in the audience kb yes and just to help you out i 'll so nobody can see what you 're doing i 'll also ok and tell me when you so swivel around on your chair they 'll keep an eye on me to make sure i don 't do anything funny give them an extra give the plinths an extra mix up and then line them up no messing around this time ok yes or no this is your decision not mine do you think the spike is under your left"
