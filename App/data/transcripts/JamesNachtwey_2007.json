  "transcript": "as someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out of body experience and a deer caught in the headlights so please forgive me for violating one of the ted commandments by relying on words on paper and i only hope i 'm not struck by lightning bolts before i 'm done i 'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer i was a student in the ' 60s a time of social upheaval and questioning and on on a personal level an awakening sense of idealism the war in vietnam was raging the civil rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me and so did millions of other americans their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism they not only recorded history they helped change the course of history their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience i saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism specifically visual journalism can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of adding momentum to success in the face of poor political judgment or political inaction it assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior it puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact what happens at ground level and i understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view and as a reaction it stimulates public opinion and gives thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda much as they would like to and in order to survive it must be a successful business society 's problems can 't be solved until they 're identified the press is a service industry and the service it provides is awareness every story does not have to sell something there 's also a time to give seeing the war created such high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution but i was driven by an inherent sense that a picture that revealed the true face of war would almost by definition be an like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events and issues i 've been involved in over the past twenty five years i saw that the front lines of contemporary wars are not on isolated battlefields but right where people live during the early ' 80s i spent a lot of time in central america which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the cold war and i saw an image that reflected the history of latin america conquest through a combination of the bible and the sword an a destroyed tank belonging to somoza 's national guard was left as a monument in a park in managua and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child at the same i 've been covering the hundred and eighty one in two thousand and one the uprising escalated into an armed conflict and one of the major incidents was the destruction of the palestinian refugee camp in the west bank town of jenin without the political will to find common ground the continual friction of tactic and only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance and perpetuates the cycle of violence neighbor against neighbor a bedroom the place where people share intimacy where life itself is conceived became a battlefield a mosque in northern bosnia was destroyed by serbian artillery and was used as a makeshift morgue dead serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or bosnian soldiers killed in action this was once a park the bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now at the same time in south africa after nelson mandela had been released from prison the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid i had to use it turn it into something that would clarify my vision instead of clouding it after several weeks they washed off the white and took on in somalia the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out farmers were driven off their land starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction primitive but extremely effective the international community responded with massive humanitarian and after the tragic battle in mogadishu they were withdrawn again international ngos united under the umbrella of the u n staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved and i want my testimony to be honest and uncensored this man was in an ngo feeding center being helped as much as he could be helped he literally had nothing he was a yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move he had not given up and if he didn 't give up how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope and it was the most uplifting thing i 've ever seen it exemplified the best that humanity has to offer and he even turned his i think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world perhaps because a lesson had been learned by the weak response to the war in bosnia they were received in and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways between one thousand nine hundred and killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside i found a boy from the local orphanage wandering around the front line my work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war to a focus on critical social issues as well after the fall of ceausescu i went to romania and discovered a kind of gulag of children where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions ceausescu had imposed a quota on the number of children to be produced by each family thereby making women 's bodies an instrument of state economic policy and confined for life to inhuman conditions as reports began to surface again international aid went in going deeper into the legacy of the eastern european regimes i worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population an aluminum factory in czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust and four out of five workers came down with cancer i began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a railway embankment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident unsolicited donations poured in a trust fund was established and the family now lives in a house in the countryside and all their basic necessities are taken care of it was a story that wasn 't trying to sell anything and the readers responded i met a band of homeless children who 'd come to jakarta from the countryside and ended up living in a train station by the age of twelve they 'd become beggars and drug addicts the rural poor had become the urban poor and in the process they 'd become invisible these heroin addicts in detox in pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by beckett agent orange was a defoliant used during the vietnam war to deny cover to the vietcong and the north an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation i thought it was important to whether by international ngos or by local grassroots organizations so many children have been orphaned by the epidemic that grandmothers have taken the place of parents i began documenting the close connection between hiv aids this is an msf hospital in cambodia my pictures can play a supporting role to the work of ngos by shedding light on the critical social problems they 're trying to deal with i went to congo with msf and contributed to a book and an exhibition that focused attention on a forgotten war in which millions of people have died and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon a malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program this time i was on assignment for a magazine but again worked closely an msf hospital in a camp for displaced people a prisoner on a chain gang in alabama was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun among them questions about race and equality and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available in the yard of a chain gang in alabama i didn 't see either of the planes hit and when i glanced out my window i saw the first tower burning i thought it might have been an accident i knew we were at war in the midst of the wreckage at ground zero i had a realization i 'd been photographing in the islamic world since not only in the middle east but also in africa asia and europe at the time i was photographing in these different places i thought i the central commercial district of kabul afghanistan at the end of the civil war shortly before the city fell to the taliban mine victims being helped at the red cross rehab center being run by alberto cairo i 'd witnessed immense suffering in the islamic world from political oppression civil war foreign invasions poverty famine i understood that in its when war with iraq was imminent i realized the american troops would be very well covered so i decided to cover the invasion from inside baghdad a day after american forces entered baghdad a company of marines began rounding up bank robbers and were cheered on by the crowds a hopeful moment that was short lived for the first time in years shi 'ites and i was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion a group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives it was obvious that the shi 'ites were a force to be reckoned with and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them this is a helicopter medic giving cpr to a soldier who had been shot in the head military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history the signature weapon of the war is the ied and the signature wound is severe leg damage the wounded face a grueling physical and psychological struggle in rehab i tried to imagine myself in their place and i was totally humbled by their courage and determination good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results one day in rehab someone started talking about surfing and all these guys who 'd never surfed before said hey let 's go they went surfing photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what 's going on sometimes they put their lives on the line because they believe your opinions and your influence matter they aim their pictures at your best the refusal to accept the unacceptable my ted wish and i wish for ted to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting thank you very much"
