  "transcript": "i thought i 'd tell you a little about and i like to and i see my life as a series of experiments so i work for esquire magazine and a couple of years ago i wrote an article called my outsourced life they answered my emails they answered my phone they argued with my wife for me and because i just sat back and i i read books and watched movies it was a wonderful experience more recently i wrote an article for esquire called and this is a movement where this is started by a psychologist in virginia who says that except maybe during poker and golf his only exceptions and more than that whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth so i decided i would try this for a month this was the worst month of my life the article was called i and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world or more precisely from aak which is a type of east asian music all the way to i don 't want to ruin the ending it 's a very so i won 't ruin it but i love that one because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb although listening to kevin kelly you don 't have to remember anything you can just google it so i wasted some time there i love those experiments but i think that the most profound and life changing experiment that i 've done is my most recent experiment where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible the year of living biblically and i undertook this for two reasons the first was that i grew up with no religion at all as in my book i 'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian so not very but i 've become increasingly interested in religion i do think it 's the defining issue of our time or the second reason i undertook this is because i 'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism so i decided to take it to its logical conclusion without picking and choosing the first thing i did was i i had christian bibles i had jewish bibles a friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible where the twenty third psalm is rendered as the lord is all that as opposed to what i knew it as the lord is my shepherd then i went down and i read and i wrote down every single law that i could find and this was a very long list over seven hundred rules and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of the ten commandments so i wanted to follow those and actually i take my projects very seriously because i had twins during my year so i but i i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible and this is what i looked like by the end as you can imagine i spent a lot of time at airport security my wife wouldn 't kiss me so i thought sounds strange but i 'll try it you only know if you try it i got rid of all my the bible says that if two men are in a fight and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the so i wanted to follow that rule looking like she had a strong grip so oh there 's another shot of my i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing and incredibly challenging and there were two types of laws that were particularly the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day you know and i work as a journalist so this was seventy five eighty percent of my day i had to do it but it was really interesting because i was able to to make some progress because and i became a little bit of a better person so i had always thought you know you change your mind and you change your behavior but it 's often the other way around you change your behavior and you change your mind so you and you become emotionally involved in that cause so it really was cognitive psychology you know cognitive dissonance that i was experiencing the bible actually talks about cognitive psychology very primitive cognitive psychology in the proverbs it says the second type of and perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning it 's a big part of the bible so i figured i had to address it so i was able to stone one adulterer it happened you know because again the outer affects the inner i wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind and this man came up to me and he said why are you dressed like that and i explained my project are you going to stone me and i said well that would be great and i actually hoping for just this and still quite angry he grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face and i felt that i could eye for an eye i could retaliate and throw one back at him and it did allow me to in a more serious way these big issues how can the bible be so barbaric in some places and yet so incredibly wise in others how should we view the bible should we view it you know as original intent like a sort of a scalia version how was the bible written and actually since this is a tech crowd i talk in the book about how the bible actually reminds me of the wikipedia because it has all of these authors and so i thought i would i would end by telling you just a couple of the the take aways the bigger the first is or here 's another example it 's a very relaxing but this one is the bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month and more than that you cannot sit on and i had to spend much of the year standing until i i bought my own seat and so you know i met with creationists i went to and these are the ultimate literalists and it was fascinating because they were not stupid people at all i would wager that their iq is exactly the same as the average evolutionist it 's just that their faith is so strong and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this there 's you can see a movie of the flood and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will whatever you think of creationism and i think it 's crazy they did a great job another lesson is that that thou shalt give thanks and this one was a big but and i started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day that i didn i didn 't even notice that i as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong so this is actually a key to happiness for me is to just remember when i came over here the car didn 't flip over and i didn 't trip coming up the stairs it 's that thou shall have reverence this one was and by the end of the year i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic and that our rituals can be sacred this was one of the great things about my year doing the sabbath because i am a workaholic so having this one day where you cannot work so this idea of sacredness whether or not there is a god thou shall not stereotype this one happened because i i spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout america because i wanted it to be more than about my so i spent time with evangelical christians and hasidic jews and the amish i 'm very proud because i think i i 'm the only person in america to out bible talk a jehovah 's witness he looked at his watch he 's like i gotta go interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about for instance evangelical christianity and i found that it 's such a wide and varied movement that that it is difficult to make which are the ones that jesus spoke that 's how they printed them in the old bibles they have a pamphlet that says here 's what jesus said about homosexuality so they say jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts helping this was very inspiring to me i recommend jim wallis and tony campolo also thou shalt not disregard the irrational this one was was very unexpected because you know i grew up with the scientific worldview and and they 're not to be completely dismissed because i learned that and i would ask these religious people why would the bible possibly tell us to do this why would god care and they said we don 't know but it 's just rituals you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake here 's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics would the martians say ' well that guy he makes sense but that guy 's crazy ' so no i think that rituals are by nature irrational so the key is to choose the right rituals the ones that that are not and finally and this one i learned because and i failed miserably because you can 't you have to pick and choose and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing the key is to pick and choose the right parts there 's the phrase and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way and they 'll say oh it 's just cafeteria religion you 're just picking and choosing but my argument is i 've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave it 's about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion about tolerance about loving your neighbor as opposed to the parts about then we have to really engage it and wrestle with"
