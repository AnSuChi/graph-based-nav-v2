  "transcript": "i come from britain but i 've been living in maldives for capital where i live actually sitting here today in mysore we 're closer to to mal than we are to delhi for example maldives is not such a bad place to be and it has been my home these years i spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life i study fish this is a blue whale we have blue whales in the waters around here off maldives around the waters of india you can see them off kerala one of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region you can see blue whales very very easily it 's probably the best place in the world to see them when i talk about the northeast monsoon season i 'm sure many of you here know exactly what i mean but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure i need to explain a little bit about monsoons now monsoon the root of the word monsoon comes from the word season so it 's just a season and there are two seasons in most of and the way it works is it comes from the southwest and then in the winter across the indian keep that in mind and i 'm actually going to talk this afternoon about dragonflies this is a very beautiful species it 's called the oriental scarlet and one thing you need to know about dragonflies one important thing is that they lay their eggs in fresh water they need fresh they feed on and they climb out burst out as the adult which we see and typically and then the adult which comes or two months so it 's essentially a freshwater animal it really does need now the particular species of dragonfly i want to talk about is this one because most dragonflies like the one we 've just seen when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life it doesn 't go very far it can 't travel very far a few kilometers maybe is quite they don 't go too far but this guy is an exception and this is called the globe skimmer australia into the pacific it 's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly if you 're going to study dragonflies you want to study those really bright beautiful ones like that red one or the really rare ones the endemic endangered ones this is is it seems a bit dull you know it 's sort of and i feel very privileged to have stumbled across didn 't notice any dragonflies maybe they were there maybe they weren 't didn 't notice them but after some time after some months one day as i was going out and about something like this these are all i didn 't know at the time but i know now they 're globe skimmers hundreds of them and they were there for some time and then they were gone and then the year after that and where they came from or anything and again i didn 't think too much of it but slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening because dragonflies need fresh water to breed and the maldives and i 'm sure some of you have been there beautiful place so global warming but i 'm not going to talk about that another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains the rainwater soaks down into the soil so but dragonflies a millions millions of dragonflies turn up i got a little bit curious in fact i 'll stop here because i want to ask and there is a lot of those of you who are indian or spent your childhood here let me have a show of hands who of you you 're too keen you 're too keen no hang on hang on wait for the go i 'll say go those of you who grew up in india swarms of dragonflies maybe at school maybe tying little bits of string onto them maybe pulling bits off i 'm not asking about that it 's a widespread phenomenon throughout south asia and i got a bit curious about it maldives is still in the southwest monsoon i got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues when do you see the dragonflies average 24th of september so late september down in trivandrum a bit later far north of maldives a bit later then mal against the wind how on earth are they doing that i didn 't know the next thing i did was i started counting dragonflies i wanted to know about their seasonality what time of year this is when they first arrive but how long are they around for does that give any clues and i cycled around the the island of mal it 's about five kilometers around counting the dragonflies as i go trying not to bump into people as i 'm looking in the trees season that 's not the southwest season that 's the inter monsoon and that sort of gives the impression you 've got one air mass going up and down up and down it doesn 't work like that what happens actually masses and there is a front between them it 's at an angle but the wind above is from the northeast monsoon dragonflies are actually coming from india on the northeast monsoon but at an altitude at one thousand to two thousand meters up in the air incredible these little insects it 's the same ones we see out here [ in india ] two inches long five centimeters long i 've tracked this one i know how they come here flying out over the ocean every year what on earth are they doing well to they 're making it all the way across and i know because when you look at the rainfall these particular insects these globe skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are the monsoon rains the larvae have to develop very quickly they only take six weeks instead of eleven months they 're six weeks they 're up and they 're off now here we have in case they 've got to go hunting for seasonal where now this is southeast africa it 's slightly more complicated than that if it rains here they 'll breed but most of them are going to carry on and next stop perhaps only four or five days away and the dragonflies are there i have reports from my various contacts the dragonflies are here now they 're breeding and the clever thing is the wind maximum opportunities for reproduction not only that because you have this convection you have this rising of the air where it 's hot air is drawn in there 's a convergence so wherever the rain is falling the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that 's rising lay their eggs next generation they come up automatically carried to where the rain is falling it 's now back there they come out it 's time this is a circuit of about four generations mind you for a two inch long insect it 's quite incredible those of you from north america will be familiar with the monarch butterfly it 's only half the length of this one and this this crossing here of the ocean is the the only and i only stumbled on this because i was living in mal in maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on and it 's called the amur falcon because it breeds in amurland which is an area along the amur river which the border much of it is the border between but it 's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter it 's well you can imagine so but then the being sensible stopped so now they don stop here or even down here no they turn across here they have a little refueling stop in and they winter down here [ in southern africa ] incredible this is the most extraordinary migration of any the hobby this fellow is a very nice bird they make use of exactly the same i know they travel at the same altitude the crossing from india to africa"
