  "transcript": "what if i could present you a story that you would remember with your entire body and not just with your mind i 've worked in documentary i 've worked in broadcast so the deal is that with vr virtual reality i can put you on scene in the middle of the story by putting on these goggles that track wherever you look you get this families in america are going hungry food banks are overwhelmed and they 're often running out of food now i knew but maybe i could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical so again this is five years ago so doing journalism and virtual reality together was considered a believe me i had a lot of colleagues laughing at me and i did though have a really great intern a woman and together we went out to food banks and started recording audio and photographs she had been on scene at a long line where the woman running the line was feeling extremely overwhelmed and she was screaming there 's too many people there 's too many people as soon as i heard that audio i knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece that could really describe what was going on at food banks and again as i said we didn 't have very much funding so i had to reproduce it with and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models and make things as accurate as we could and then we tried to convey what happened that day with as much as accuracy as is possible for him he 's in the room with that body he should be able to see that that he 's not actually on the street so that piece ended up going to sundance in two thousand and twelve a kind of amazing thing and it was the first virtual and this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw over and over and over people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim to whisper something into his ear or in some way help so after this piece was made brought in the head of the world economic forum to try and i really wanted to do something about syrian refugee kids because children have been the worst affected by the syrian civil war i sent a team to the border of iraq to record material at refugee camps and then we also recreated a street scene in which a young girl is singing and a bomb goes off now when you 're in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds i 've had individuals who have been involved in real bombings tell me that it evokes the same kind of fear and we were put in this tapestry room there was no press about it so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day would see us with these crazy lights you know maybe they would want to see the old but a lot of people tried it and over a five day run and we were told by the curators there that they 'd never seen such an outpouring things like it 's so real absolutely believable or of course the one that i was excited about a real feeling as if you were in the middle of something that you normally see on the tv news and it doesn 't really matter where you 're from or what age you are don 't get me wrong i 'm not saying that when you 're in a piece you forget that you 're but it turns out we can feel like we 're in two and i think that 's what allows me to tap into these feelings so that means of course that i have to be very cautious about creating these pieces i have to really follow best journalistic practices and make sure that these powerful stories are built with integrity if we don 't capture the material ourselves we have to be extremely exacting about figuring out the provenance and where did this stuff come from and is it authentic let me give you an example with this trayvon martin case this is a guy a kid who was seventeen years old and he he bought soda and a candy at a store and on his way home he was tracked by a neighborhood watchman named george zimmerman who ended up shooting and killing him and we rebuilt the entire scene inside and out based on those drawings we broke some news with this story the forensic house that did the audio reconstruction primeau productions they say that they would testify that george zimmerman when he got out of the car he cocked his gun before he went to give chase to martin we 're still following the same principles that we would always what is different is the sense of being on scene whether you 're watching a guy collapse from hunger or feeling like you 're in the middle of a bomb scene this is kind of what has driven me forward with these pieces and thinking about how to make beyond the headset more available we 're creating mobile pieces like the trayvon martin piece direct deductions from their bank account money to go to syrian children refugees and start a new form of doing journalism that i think is going to join all the other normal platforms in the future"
