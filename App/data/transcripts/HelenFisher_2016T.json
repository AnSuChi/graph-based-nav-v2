  "transcript": "and i was talking with a man who had three wives i asked him how many wives would you like to have and there was this long pause and i thought to myself is he going to say five is he going to say ten is he going to say he leaned towards me and he whispered none laughter but in the vast majority of these cultures only about five having several partners can be a toothache can fight with each other we are a pair bonding species ninety seven percent of mammals do not pair up to rear their young human beings do i 'm not suggesting that we 're not that we 're necessarily sexually faithful to our partners i 've looked at adultery in i 'm going to say almost not at all i study the brain i and my colleagues have put over one hundred people into a brain scanner people who had just been rejected in love and people who are in love long term and it is possible to remain in love long term and i 've long ago maintained that we 've evolved three distinctly different brain systems for mating and reproduction sex drive feelings of intense romantic love long term partner and together these three brain systems but they lie way below the cortex way below the limbic system where we feel our emotions generate our emotions they lie in the most primitive parts of the brain linked with motivation they evolved over four point four million years ago among our first ancestors and they 're not going to change if you swipe left or right on tinder we 're seeing new rules and and taboos what about the late when the automobile became very popular and we suddenly had rolling how about the introduction of the unchained women could finally express their primitive and primal sexuality that these are not dating sites they are introducing sites when you sit down in a bar and you smile and laugh and listen and parade the way our ancestors did one hundred thousand years ago we can give you various people all the dating sites can but the only real algorithm is your own human brain technology is not going to change that technology is also not going to and i 've come to believe that we 've evolved four very broad styles of thinking and behaving linked with the dopamine so i created a questionnaire directly from brain science to measure the degree to which you express the traits the constellation of traits i then put that questionnaire on various dating sites in forty countries fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire and i 've been able to watch who 's naturally drawn to whom and as it turns out those who were very expressive of the dopamine system tend to be curious creative spontaneous energetic i would imagine there 's an awful lot of people like that in this room they 're drawn to people like themselves curious creative people need people like themselves tend to be religious religiosity is in the serotonin system opposites attract people very expressive of the testosterone decisive and they go for their opposite they go for somebody who 's high estrogen somebody who 's got very good verbal skills and people skills who 's very intuitive and who 's very nurturing and emotionally expressive it 's associated with the concept of paradox of choice for millions of years in fact i 've been studying this recently and i actually think there 's some sort of sweet spot in the brain i don 't know what it is but apparently from reading a lot of the data we can embrace about five to nine alternatives and after that you get into what academics call we 're ushering in a new form of courtship that i call slow love i arrived at this during my work with match com every year for the last six years we 've done a study called singles in we use people a representative sample of americans based on the us census we 've got data now on over thirty thousand people and every single year i see some of the same patterns every single year when i ask the question over fifty percent of people have had a one night stand not necessarily last year but in their lives and over fifty percent have lived with a person long term before marrying and i stumbled then on a statistic that really came home to me it was a very interesting academic article in which i found that percent of singles in america today who are living long term with somebody have not yet married because they are terrified of divorce they 're terrified i think it 's caution 's singles want to know every single thing about a partner before they wed but whether they 're kind whether they can listen and at my age whether they 've got a sense of humor and in an age where we have i think people are taking their time to love and actually what 's happening is what we 're seeing is a real expansion of the precommitment stage but the human brain and indeed in the united states today eighty six percent of americans will marry by age forty nine and even in cultures around the world where they 're not marrying as often during this long extension so i did a study of one thousand one hundred married people in america not on match com of course and i asked them a lot of questions but one of the questions was would you the person you 're currently married to and family life is not technology it women commuted to work to gather their fruits and vegetables they came home with sixty to eighty percent family was the rule and women were regarded as just as economically socially and sexually powerful as men then the environment changed some ten thousand years ago we began to settle down on the farm and both men and women became obliged really to marry the right person from the right background from the right religion and from the right and social and political connections men 's jobs became more important they had to move the rocks fell the trees plow the land they brought the produce to local markets and came home with the equivalent of money the belief of virginity at marriage arranged marriages strictly arranged marriages the belief that the man is the head of the household that the wife 's place is in the home honor thy husband and ' til death do us we are right now in a marriage revolution we are shedding ten thousand years of our farming tradition and moving forward towards egalitarian relationships between the sexes something i regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit i 'm not a pollyanna there 's a great deal to cry about i 've studied divorce in eighty cultures i 've studied as i say adultery in many there 's a whole pile of problems as william butler yeats the poet once said love is the crooked thing i would add nobody gets out alive in fact i think the poet randall jarrell really sums it up best he said the dark uneasy world of family life where the greatest can fail and the humblest succeed and i will conclude by saying there 's another speaker here with us that works in your same field she comes at it from a different perspective esther perel is a psychotherapist who works with couples esther studies the stories the couples tell her when they come to her for help let 's have her join us on the stage helen 's talk was there any part of it that resonated with you through the lens of your own work that you 'd like to comment on esther perel it 's interesting because on the one hand the need for love but the way we love the meaning we make out of it the rules that govern our we come from a model that until now was primarily regulated around duty and obligation the needs of the collective and loyalty and we have shifted it to a model of free choice and individual and individual rights and that was the first thing i thought that the need doesn 't change but the context and the way we regulate these relationships changes a lot you know on the one hand we relish the novelty and the playfulness i see many many people who who dread creating a case of fomo and then leading us fomo fear of missed opportunity or fear of missing out it 's like how do i know i have found ' the one ' the right one so we 've created what i call this thing of stable ambiguity stable ambiguity is when you are too afraid to be alone but also not really willing to engage in of tactics that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship but also the uncertainty of the breakup so here on the internet you have three major ones one is icing and simmering which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship but at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries yeah because you 're making as i was listening to you like how a vocabulary that 's my question to you do you think when the context changes it still means that the nature of love remains the same you study the brain and i study people 's relationships and stories so does it at some point begin to change if the meaning changes does it change the need or is the need clear of the entire context to your first one there 's no question that we 've changed that we now want a person to love in my studies of five thousand people every year i ask them what are you looking for and every single year over ninety seven of people want somebody that respects them somebody they can trust and confide in somebody who makes them laugh somebody who makes enough time for them and somebody who they find physically attractive and there 's certainly you know no question about it but it 's interesting the millennials actually want to be whereas the generation above them wants to have a very fine marriage but is not as focused on being a good parent and and you went for it you hf i do want to say one more thing the bottom line is in hunting and gathering societies they tended to have two or three partners during the course of their lives the brain is well built to what to try and decide do i come do i stay do i go do i stay what are the opportunities here how do i handle this there and so i think we 're seeing another play out of that now"
