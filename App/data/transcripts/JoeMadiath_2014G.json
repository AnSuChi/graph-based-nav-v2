  "transcript": "it is very fashionable aromas after the food goes through the digestive system when it is thrown out as crap it is no longer fashionable to speak about it it is rather revolting i 'm a guy who has graduated from gram vikas which means village development organization was working in the area of renewable energy on the most part we were producing biogas biogas for we produce but realizing later on how important were we in india and most developing countries and when we look at the reason for poor quality water you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste finds its way back to and this is the cause for eighty percent of the diseases in rural areas in it is unfortunately so that is a pitiable state of affairs open defecation is rampant seventy percent of india defecates in the open hiding their faces and sitting there in pristine glory sixty percent of all the crap that is thrown into the open is by indians i don 't know if we indians can be proud of such a distinction so we together with a lot of villages we began to talk about how to really address this situation of sanitation and we came together and formed a project called mantra mantra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas so we are speaking about transformation transformation in rural areas they organize a legal society where the general body consists of all members who elect a group of men and women who implement the project and they decide to build a toilet and from a protected water source water will be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households through three taps one in the toilet one in the shower one in the kitchen twenty four hours a day do not have which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter that poor people deserve poor solutions and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions this combined with a nobel most economic is the heady cocktail that the poor are forced to drink we feel that and they should not be humiliated sanitation is more about dignity than about and so you build these toilets and very often we have to hear that the toilets are better than their houses and you can see that in front are the attached houses and the others are the toilets so these people and aggregates usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost of external materials like cement steel toilet commode mostly landless are given an opportunity to be trained as masons and and when both are they build and of course also a an elevated water reservoir and when it is full it is blocked and it can go but we discovered that papaya trees on the periphery of these leach pits they grow very well because they suck up all the nutrients and you get very tasty bananas papayas if any of you come to i would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you so there you can see it is always a 24 hour water supply because water gets polluted very often when you store it a child dips his his or her hand into it something falls into it so no water is stored it 's always on tap which are used by the village for different we have had clear evidence but we have empirical usually used to spend especially in the summer months about six to seven hours a day because as i said earlier it 's only women who carry water they used to take their so there but girls it has gone to about almost to one hundred percent vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers who are the daily wage earners because they have gone through this training to be masons and plumbers now their ability to earn has increased so this is a democracy in action because and that is democracy at the grassroots level in action more than one thousand two hundred villages have so far done this it benefits over four hundred thousand people and it 's still going on and i hope it continues to move ahead for india software companies and spaceships may not be as important as thank you very much"
