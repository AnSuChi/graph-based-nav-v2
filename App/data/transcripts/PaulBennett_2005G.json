  "transcript": "in bauer bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us one of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the big wants the big being the organization the system the country i thought talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers to bring people into the process of creating things bringing together the small to help facilitate and create the big i think is something that we believe in something i believe in and something that we kind of bring to life i call this first chapter for the brits in the room the blinding glimpse of the bleeding obvious often the good ideas are so that you kind of miss them and i think a lot of times what we do is just sort of hold the mirror up to our clients and sort of go duh you know look what 's really going on and rather than talk about it in the theory i think i 'm just going to show you an example we were asked by a large healthcare system in minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was and i think they were expecting they 'd worked with lots of consultants before i think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this that and other and all kinds of mappy stuff or even worse some kind of ghastly the first thing we actually shared with them was was this i 'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve we showed them the whole cut and they were all completely what is this and the point is is when you lie in a hospital bed all day all you do is look at the roof and it 's a really shitty experience and just putting yourself in the position of the patient this is christian who works with us at ideo he just lay in the hospital bed and kind of stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time that 's what it 's like to be a patient in the hospital looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in and so that was a really catalytic thing the first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor you could actually have a conversation with them you could kind of see them in your rear view mirror so it created a tiny human interaction very small example of something that they could do interestingly we embrace this what can we do the first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling sort of laurence world 's best design solution for those of us who are real sort of hard core designers but nonetheless a fabulous empathic solution for people things that they started doing themselves like changing the floor going into the patient 's room so that it signified this is my room this is my personal space was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem so you went from public space to private space and another idea again that came from one of the nurses which i love then they put them on one wall of the patient 's room and they put this sticker there so that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room which was lovely so tiny tiny tiny solutions that made a huge amount of i thought that was a really really nice example seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution it 's a history of invention based around this i 'm going to read this because i want to get these names right joan ganz cooney saw her daughter came down on a saturday morning saw her daughter watching the test card waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came sesame street malcolm mclean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship and he invented the shipping container george de mestral this is not bugs all over a birkenstock was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs sort of little prickly things and from that and finally for the brits percy shaw this is a big british invention saw the cat 's eyes at the side of the road when he was driving home one night and from that came so there 's a whole series of just using your eyes seeing things for the first time seeing things afresh second one without sounding overly zen is a quote from the buddha finding yourself in the margins looking to the edges of things is often a really interesting place to start blinkered vision tends to produce i think blinkered solutions so looking wide using your peripheral vision is a really interesting place to look for opportunity again another medical example we were asked by a device producer we did the palm pilot and the treo we did a lot of sexy tech at ideo they 'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics this was a device that a nurse and they had this vision of the nurse kind of clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly this procedure taking place and i 'll explain this in a second it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren 't recognizing when you 're having a four inch needle inserted into your spine which was the procedure that this device 's data was about it was for pain management you 're shit you 're freaking out and so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did was hold the patient 's hand to comfort them human gesture which made the fabulous two handed data input completely impossible so the thing that we designed much less sexy but much more human and practical so it 's not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination but it has a thumb scroll so you can do everything with one hand so again going back to this the idea that a tiny human gesture and i think that 's really really important so again this idea of workarounds we use this phrase workarounds a lot sort of looking around us i was actually looking around the ted and just watching all of these kind of this idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential we wrote a book recently why do we all follow the line in the street we don 't know why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle again we 're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions so we park our shopping cart there it 's there for our use on some some level so again we sort of co opt our environment to do all these different things we co opt other experiences we take one item and transfer it to another and this is my favorite one my mother used to say to me just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn 't mean you have to but of course we all do we all follow each other every day so somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something that 's permission for them to do the same thing and there 's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time i mean shopping bag equals parking meter out of order and we all kind of know how to read these signals now we all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we 're doing third section is this idea of not knowing of consciously putting yourself backwards i talk about unthinking situations all the time sort of having beginner 's mind scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh a friend of mine was a designer and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children but big selling bookcase how do we replicate this for children the reality is when you actually watch children children don 't think about things like storage in linear and so their spatial awareness relationship and their thinking around storage is totally different so the first thing you have to do so what came out of this so what is this i hear you all ask no i don 't so you know it 's a totally different way of looking at the situation it 's a completely empathic solution apart from the fact that teddy 's probably not loving it but a really nice way of and i think that 's one of the things and putting yourself in the position of the person and i think that 's one of the threads that i 've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples ' shoes and really feel what they feel and then use that information to fuel solutions and i think that that 's what this is very much about last section green armband we 've all got them it 's about this it 's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win again that 's one of the themes that i think has come through loud and clear we were asked to design a water pump for a company called approtec in kenya they 're now called kickstart and again as designers we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form and that was completely irrelevant when you put yourself position of become much more relevant than the form of it the way it 's produced it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials so it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user we had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world so what seems like a very clunky product is in fact incredibly useful it 's powered a bit like a stairmaster you pump up and down on it children can use it adults can use it everybody uses it it 's turning these guys again one of the themes it 's turning them into entrepreneurs these guys are using this very successfully and for us it 's been great because it 's won loads of design awards so we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company the needs of the individuals in the company to feel good about a product we were actually designing and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for so as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning we 've made a donation on everybody 's behalf here to kick start no pun their next project because again i think sort of putting our money where our mouth is here so that 's it"
