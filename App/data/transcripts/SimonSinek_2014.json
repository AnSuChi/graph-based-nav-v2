  "transcript": "there 's a man by the name of captain william swenson who recently was awarded the congressional medal of honor for his actions on september eight two thousand and nine on that day a column of american and afghan troops were making their way through a part of afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials a group of of afghan government officials who would be meeting with some local and amongst many other captain swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead and what was remarkable about this day is by sheer coincidence one of the medevac medics happened to have a gopro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera it shows captain swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a and then you see captain swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more where do people like that come from and i wanted to know why is it that i don 't have people that i work with like that you know in business we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain we have it backwards right what i learned every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things and more importantly others have that capacity too i 've had the great honor of getting to meet some of these who we would call heroes and i asked them why would you do it why did you do it and they all say because they would have done it for me it 's this deep sense of trust and cooperation the problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings they are not instructions i can 't simply say to you trust me it 's a feeling nothing personal all of these things working to reduce our lifespan and so we evolved into social animals where we lived together and worked together in what i call a circle of safety the natural reaction was trust and cooperation if i don 't trust or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you it 's sometimes trying to put you out of business but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your and that 's where leadership matters because it 's the leader that sets the tone when a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong remarkable things happen i was flying and i was witness to an incident and i watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law like a criminal he was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon so i said something i said why do you have treat us like cattle why can 't you treat us like human beings if i don 't follow the rules i could get in trouble or lose my job all she was telling me is that she doesn 't feel safe all she was telling me is that the reason we like flying southwest airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people it 's because they don 't fear their leaders when we feel safe inside the organization we will discipline them when necessary all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine charlie kim who 's the ceo of a company called next jump he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family would you ever charlie implemented just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a c it 's the complete opposite this is the reason so many people have such a visceral it 's that they have violated the very definition of leadership they have violated this deep seated social contract we know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests this is what so offends us not the numbers would anybody be offended if we gave a $ one hundred and fifty million bonus to gandhi none at all great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers they would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people bob chapman who runs a large manufacturing company in the midwest called in two thousand and eight was hit very hard by the and they lost they needed to save ten million dollars the board got together and discussed layoffs bob believes every employee from secretary to ceo was required to take but it was how bob announced the program that mattered so much he said it 's better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot and morale went up they saved and quite spontaneously nobody expected people started trading with each other those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less people would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three leadership is a choice not a rank and i know many people and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them this is what a leader is i heard a story of some marines and he let his men and when they went back out in the field field his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat and when we do the natural response people will sacrifice for us they will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leader 's vision comes to life and when we ask them why would you do that why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person they all say the same thing because they would have done it for me and isn 't that the organization we would all like to work in thank you very much"
