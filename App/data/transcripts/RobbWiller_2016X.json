of our lifetimes but you might also reasonably wonder if research backs up your intuition and in a nutshell the answer is sadly yes we find that liberals and conservatives have grown further apart they increasingly wall themselves off in these ideological silos more and more choosing to live in different parts of the country and i think that most alarming of all of it is seeing this rising animosity on both sides liberals and conservatives democrats and republicans more and more they just don 't like one another they don 't want to befriend one another they don 't want to date one another if they do and they more and more don 't want their children to marry someone who supports the other party a particularly shocking statistic you know in my lab the students that i work with we 're talking about some sort of social pattern and so i 'm often like what kind of movie are we in here with this pattern so what kind of movie are we in with political polarization well it could be a disaster movie it but what i keep thinking is that we 're in a zombie apocalypse movie seized by this mob mentality trying to spread their disease and all this hate and polarization it 's being propagated by the other people because we 're brad pitt right trying to hold on to what we hold dear you know not foot soldiers in the army of the undead not that never that what movie do you suppose they think they 're and you 'd better believe that they think that they 're brad pitt and that we we are the zombies and who 's to say that they 're wrong what can we do to chip away at polarization in everyday life what could we do to connect with and communicate with our political counterparts and one of the first things that we discovered that i think is really helpful for understanding polarization is to understand that the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide so one of the most robust findings in the history we find that liberals tend to endorse values like equality and fairness and care and protection from harm more than conservatives do and and matt and i were thinking that maybe this moral divide might be helpful for understanding how it is that liberals and conservatives talk to one another and why they so often seem to talk past one another when they do conducted a study where we recruited liberals to a study where they were supposed to write a persuasive essay that would be compelling to a conservative in support of same sex marriage and what we found was that liberals tended to make arguments in terms of the liberal moral values of equality and fairness so they said things they being gay americans deserve the same equal rights as other americans overall we found that sixty nine percent of liberals invoked one of the more liberal moral values in constructing their essay even though they were supposed to be trying to persuade conservatives we found that they weren 't much you can see right away why we 're in trouble here right why are they going to give that up just to agree with you on something that they don 't particularly want to agree with you on anyway if that persuasive appeal that you 're making to your republican uncle means that he doesn 't just have to change his view he 's got to change his underlying values too that so what would work better and we 've studied it in a series of experiments we recruited liberals and conservatives to a study where they read one of three essays before having their environmental attitudes surveyed and the first of these essays was a liberal values of care and protection from harm it said things like in many important ways we are causing real harm to the places we live in and it is essential that we take steps now to prevent further destruction from being done to our earth it was a pro environmental essay as well drinking water and skies pure is of vital importance we should regard the pollution of the places we live in to be disgusting and reducing pollution can help us preserve what is pure and beautiful about the places we live and then we had a third group that were assigned to read just a and what we found when we surveyed people about their environmental attitudes afterwards we found that liberals it didn 't matter what essay they read they tended to have highly pro environmental attitudes regardless liberals are on board for environmental protection even though this essay didn 't even mention global warming but that 's how robust this moral reframing effect was and we 've studied this on a whole slew of different political issues so if you want to move conservatives and we studied it the other way too if you want to move liberals to the right on conservative policy issues like military spending and making english the official to be more persuasive if you tie those conservative policy issues to liberal moral values like equality and fairness and when you say it like that it seems really obvious right like why did we don 't persuade so much as we rehearse our own reasons for why we believe some sort of political position we kept saying when we were designing these reframed moral arguments empathy and respect if you can tap into that you can connect so thinking again about maybe instead it 's a buddy cop movie just roll with it they don 't get along because of this difference it 's greater because of that gulf that they had to late in the second act of a buddy cop movie it sounds good but if we want it to happen i think the responsibility is going to start with us so let 's do it despite the politicians and the media and facebook and twitter and congressional redistricting and all of it all the things that divide us and let 's do it because this hate and contempt that flows through all of us every day we owe it to one another and our country to reach out and try to connect and we can 't afford to let them hate us either thank you"
