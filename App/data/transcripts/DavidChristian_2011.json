  "transcript": "but as you look at it i hope you 'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy because you may notice that what 's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of what that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure look around us eric beinhocker estimates that in new york city alone there are some ten billion skus or distinct commodities being traded but with great difficulty fred spier calls goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost the complex things get more fragile and it 's more difficult to create desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility do it let 's begin by winding the timeline back thirteen point seven billion years to the beginning of time around us emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that 's where we are and then suddenly it contains everything and it 's expanding at incredible speed within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that in the first second now we move forward three hundred and eighty thousand years and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium now i want to pause for a moment three hundred and eighty thousand years after the origins of the universe because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they 're really a sort of cosmic mush the blue areas so where you get slightly denser areas gravity gets more powerful the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of ten million degrees protons start to fuse there 's a huge release of we have our first stars and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex they create temperatures so high and in a chemically more complex universe it 's possible to make more things and what starts happening is that around young suns young stars they form particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion now but they 're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity i 'm talking of course about living organisms living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge packages of chemicals so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales than gravity which explains why you and i are smaller than stars or planets now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry what are the goldilocks conditions well but not too little what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they 're close to stars but not too close and you need liquids such as water why well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they can 't hitch up they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules now where do you find such goldilocks conditions well planets are great and our early earth was almost perfect and deep beneath those oceans at cracks in the earth 's crust fantastic chemistry began to happen life is more than just exotic chemistry how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well it 's here that life introduces an entirely new trick you stabilize the template and you allow the template to copy itself and dna of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information you so dna contains information about how to make living organisms and what that means it 's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work dna 's learning and it 's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years you get fungi you get fish there are disasters creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear and the dinosaurs were wiped out and we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began sixty five million years ago with the landing of an asteroid and i believe we count let me explain why but it is so slow and those organisms can learn the information dies with them now what makes humans different we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we 've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory and that 's why as a species we 're so creative and so powerful and that 's why we have a history we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift it 's what makes us different but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the ice age tundra of siberia tough tough environment into the americas into australasia each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways denser more interconnected humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through telegraph through the internet until now we seem to form a single so here we are i hope you agree this is a but it also contains warnings and it 's not clear that we humans are in charge of it i remember very vividly as a child growing up in england living through the cuban missile crisis for a if we avoid that trap so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us our power with collective learning and now finally this is what i want i want my grandson daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the story of big history and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us we believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as daniel i thank you for your attention"
