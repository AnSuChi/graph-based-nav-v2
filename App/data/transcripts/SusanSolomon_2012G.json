  "transcript": "embryonic stem cells are really we actually will be able to use stem cells to replace cells that are damaged or diseased because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model disease our ability to understand why we get sick and even develop drugs going to allow our children to look at alzheimer 's and diabetes and other major diseases which is as a preventable disease which has enormous hope for and we saw that it was really essential to have private safe haven laboratories where this work could be and so in two thousand and five we started the new york stem cell foundation laboratory so that we would have a small organization that could do this work and and support it what we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research but also developing drugs and treatments is dominated by as you would expect large organizations but in a new field sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way and sometimes they can 't ask the right questions and there is an enormous gap that 's just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and we were going to have to address this with two things new technologies and also a new research model and so we developed a new technology it 's software and hardware that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines but it 's going to allow us in doing that to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells not animal cells to generate drugs and treatments that are much more effective much safer much faster and at a much lower cost so let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context this is an extremely new field in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight human embryonic stem cells were first and just nine years later a group of scientists in japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell or what we refer to as an ips cell so a few months later in two thousand and eight one of our scientists built on that research he took skin biopsies this time from people who had a disease als or as you call it in the u k motor neuron disease he turned them into the ips so basically what he did was to take and this was extraordinary because it was the first time that we had a model of a disease from a living patient in living human cells and as he watched the disease unfold he was able to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying in the disease in a different way than the field had previously thought there was another kind of cell that actually was sending out a toxin so you could really say that researchers trying to understand the cause of disease without being able to have human stem cell models were much like investigators trying to figure out what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash but they really had no way of knowing what led to the terrible events and stem cells really have given us the black box for diseases and it 's an unprecedented window it really is extraordinary because you can recapitulate many many diseases in a dish you can see what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation well before you would ever see symptoms appear in a patient which hopefully will will become something that is routine in the near term of using human cells to test for drugs right now the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic to bring a successful drug to market it takes on average thirteen years that 's one drug with a sunk cost of four billion dollars and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road are actually going to get there you can 't imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers but it is really a worse social model because of what 's involved and the cost to all of us so the way we develop drugs now so we 'd been testing them on cells of mice or other creatures or cells that that we engineer and you can 't go into a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test for you know a but what you can do with human stem cells now is actually create whether it 's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells and it 's absolutely extraordinary and you 're going to know at the beginning the very you 're not going to have to wait thirteen years until you 've brought a drug to market only to find out we 've got to look at the big picture and a disease that i might have if i had alzheimer 's disease or parkinson 's disease it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease and if we both had but we had different genetic makeup and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully for me was actually ineffective for you but unfortunately it is not the way that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs and so we need to move away from this model they just say well you have feet here are your so we really have to change this there was a very sad example of this in the last decade there 's a wonderful drug and a class of drugs actually but the drug was an absolute lifesaver for another subset of those people they suffered pretty severe but imagine a different scenario where we could have had an array a genetically diverse array of cardiac cells okay people with this genetic type are going to have cardiac side effects people with these genetic subgroups or it was a lifesaver could have still taken their medicine the people for whom it was a disaster so clearly we have to think about genetics we have they are made and also when you do things artisanal is wonderful in you know your clothing and your bread and crafts but artisanal really isn 't going to work in stem cells so we have to deal with this and that actually brings us back to the mapping of the human genome because we know from the sequencing of the human genome that it 's shown us all of the a 's c 's g 's and t 's that make up our genetic that code by itself our dna is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code without having a computer that can read it it 's like having an app without having a smartphone we needed to have a way of bringing the biology to that incredible data but have it be arrayed in such a way as it could be read together and actually create this incredible avatar we need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub types that represent who we are so this is what we 've built it has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands of stem cell lines it 's and i think eventually what 's going to happen is that we 're going to want to re screen drugs on arrays like this that and in the future you 're going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects on all of the relevant cells on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells and that 's what i"
