  "transcript": "the key phrase is in when you have cancer it 's as if you disappear in a way your life as a complex lab values a list of medicines and everyone changes as well you suddenly become a disease on legs doctors start speaking a language which you don 't understand they start people start changing as well because they instead of they say what did the doctor say before even saying hello and in the meanwhile you 're left with questions to which and you wonder what have i done to deserve this you wonder can i change something doctors are the good guys in but they also are very used to having to deal with patients so i things are changing but classically they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition but instead you 're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers while i was in the hospital i asked for a printed out it was really hard to obtain because it 's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer there 's more to me whichever it is will have to deal the next day i left the i was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and i was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as drastic as a surgery i 'm an artist i use several forms and open information in my practice so my best bet was to get it all out there get the information out there and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone so i cura on which i put my medical data online actually had to hack it and that 's a thing which we can talk about in another speech i chose this in italian means the cure because in our western cultures it means eradicating or reversing from latin countries from africa it can mean many more things of course i was interested in the opinions of doctors but i was also interested in the cure of the artist i was interested in i was interested in the emotional cure i was interested in any form of cure and i received lots of media attention from italy and from abroad and i quickly received more than five hundred thousand contacts emails social networking but more of them were about how to cure myself as for example here we see francesca fini in her performance he produced a 3d can share our cancer and this was going on several researchers doctors all connected with me to with all this information and support i was able to form a team of several and several hundred volunteers with whom i was able to discuss which which is very important and together we were able to form a strategy for my own cure and the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history which is quite remarkable for me [ little to no growth of the cancer so i was able to take my time and choose i chose everyone felt like they could and this was the most important part of la as you can see pretty fine i had excellent news after the surgery i have i had a very low grade glioma i have completely changed my life everything i did was which was very intense a matrix of electrodes map of what the brain controls and right before the operation we were able to discuss the functional map of of my brain with the doctor to understand which risks i was running into and if there were any and this openness was really the fundamental part of la cura thousands of people shared their stories their experiences doctors got to talk with people they don 't usually consult when different languages in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research really depends on the wellness of all of its components this global performance is my open source cure for cancer but for us all thank you"
