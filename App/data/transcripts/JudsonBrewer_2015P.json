  "transcript": "when i was first learning to meditate the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath and when my mind wandered to bring it back sounded simple enough yet i 'd sit on these silent retreats sweating through t shirts in the middle of winter i 'd take naps so why is it so hard to pay attention well studies show that even when we 're really trying to pay attention to something like maybe this talk at some point about half of us will drift off into a daydream or have this urge to check our twitter feed so what 's going on here it turns out that we 're fighting one of the most learning processes currently known in science one that 's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man and basically goes like this we see some food that looks good our brain says and especially with sugar our bodies send a signal to our brain that says remember what you 're eating and where you found it we lay down this context dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time see food eat food feel good after a while our creative brains say you know what you can use this for more than just remembering where food is you know next time you feel bad why don 't you try eating something good so you 'll feel better we thank our brains for the great idea try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we 're mad or sad we feel better same process instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach this emotional signal feeling sad triggers that urge to eat and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think hey i want to be cool so we start smoking the marlboro man wasn 't a dork and that was no accident see cool smoke and each time we do this we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit so later feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet now with these same brain so back to my breath what if instead of fighting our brains or trying to force ourselves to pay attention we instead tapped into this natural reward based learning process but added a twist what if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience they could try to force themselves to quit smoking and the majority of them had tried this before and failed on average six times now with mindfulness training we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious in fact fact we even told them to smoke what yeah we said go ahead and smoke just be really curious about what it 's like when you do smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals yuck cognitively that smoking was bad for her that 's why she joined our program what she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit she moved from knowledge to wisdom she moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her the prefrontal cortex that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn 't smoke and it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior to help us stop smoking to help us stop eating that second that unfortunately this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out which isn 't that helpful now we can all relate to this in our own experience we 're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we 're stressed out or tired even though we know it 's not going to be helpful we just can 't help seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance naturally letting go but over time as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions we let go of old habits and form new ones the paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what 's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment this willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible and this willingness to turn toward our experience and what happens when we there 's restlessness and that these body sensations come and go these are bite size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge scary craving that we choke on we step out of our old fear based reactive habit patterns and but in one study we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking so it actually we found that parts of a neural network of self referential processing called the default mode network were at play now one current hypothesis is that a region of this network called the posterior cingulate cortex is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it when we get sucked in and it takes us for a ride in contrast when we let go step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what 's happening this brain region quiets down now we 're testing app and online based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and ironically use the same technology that 's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking of stress eating and other remember that bit about context dependent memory we can deliver these tools to peoples ' fingertips in the contexts that matter most so we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises from work or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you 're driving see if you can tap into this natural capacity just be curiously aware of what 's happening in your body and mind in that moment it will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops or step out of it instead of see text message compulsively text back feel a little bit better feel the joy of letting go and repeat"
