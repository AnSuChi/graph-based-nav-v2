  "transcript": "a natural biological process that every girl and woman goes through every month we feel awkward and shameful talking about it when i got my first periods i was told to keep it a secret from others even from my father and brother later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks our biology teacher skipped the subject i learned to stay unaware in order to stay decent and in some parts of rajasthan this number is as high as you 'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that i have spoken to who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer and they 're going to die soon but in india only twelve percent of girls and women have access to i was one i grew up in a small town called garhwa in jharkhand where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful but to store them i would hide and keep it in a dark another issue that periods brought in my life those of the social restrictions i think you all must be aware of it i was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious importance you 'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women ironically most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls and in the absence of any intervention it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation during my years of work in this field i have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately and in some households they are even secluded from other family members about eighty five percent of girls and women in india would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods every month can you imagine what this does to the affecting her personality her academic performance and every single aspect of growing up during her early formative years i religiously followed all these restrictive customs for thirteen years until a discussion with my partner tuhin changed my perception about menstruation forever in two thousand and nine tuhin and i were pursuing in design we fell in love with each other and i was at ease discussing periods with him tuhin knew little about periods to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month he was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society in order to help me with my cramps he would go on the and many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths if we being so well educated were so ill informed about menstruation there would be millions of girls out there who would be ill informed too to study to understand the problem better i undertook a year long research to while it is generally believed that menstrual and it exists with the educated urban i found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about and girls nowadays so where do the girls go two decades ago and now nothing has changed changed i shared these finding with tuhin and we wondered what if we could create something that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own something that would help parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably to young girls i was collecting a lot of stories these were stories of experiences of girls these stories would make girls curious and interested in we wanted something that would so we decided to create a comic book where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way to represent girls in their different phases of puberty we have three characters jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book they were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it the comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in india and one of the volunteers took this prototype we are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with fifteen schools in different parts of india have made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about menstruation i am amazed to see how have come together and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities have made sure that the girls learn about i dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse and i would and i would like to end this with a small request to all the parents here your daughters would be too so please be period positive"
