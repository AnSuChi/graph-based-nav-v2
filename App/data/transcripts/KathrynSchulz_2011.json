  "transcript": "and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence rhode island to portland oregon and you know we 're so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that 's been bothering me for two thousand miles what 's up with the chinese character i keep seeing by the side of the road my friend looks at me totally blankly there 's actually a gentleman in the front row who 's doing a perfect imitation of her look laughter and i 'm like you know all the signs we keep seeing with the chinese character on them and then she cracks up because she figures out what i 'm talking about and what i 'm talking about is this laughter right the famous chinese character for picnic area i 've spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this and what all of this can tell us about human nature i 've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong no job competition or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong we get it in the abstract we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes the human species in general suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window and i can 't actually think of anything i 'm wrong about and the thing is the present tense is where we live so effectively we all kind of wind up traveling through life trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything i think this is a problem i think it 's a problem for each of us as individuals in our personal and professional lives and finally i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so it is the single greatest moral intellectual and creative leap you can make so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right so let me ask you guys something or actually let me ask you guys something because you 're right here how does it feel emotionally how does it feel to be wrong dreadful thumbs down embarrassing but they 're answers to a different question you guys are answering the question how does it feel to realize you 're wrong but just being wrong doesn 't feel like anything i 'll give you an analogy do you remember that loony tunes cartoon where there 's this pathetic coyote who 's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner in pretty much every episode of this cartoon there 's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and what 's funny at least if you 're six years old is that the coyote 's totally fine too he just keeps running right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he 's in mid air that 's when he falls when we 're wrong about something not when we realize it but before that we 're like that coyote after he 's gone off the cliff and before he looks down so i should actually correct something i said a moment ago it feels like being right so this is one reason a structural reason why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness i call this error blindness most of the time we don 't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we 're wrong about something until it 's too late but there 's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well and this one is cultural and one of them looks like this this is not mine by the way and you know exactly so by the time you are nine years old you 've already learned first of all that people who get stuff wrong are lazy irresponsible dimwits and the way to succeed in life we learn these really bad lessons really well and a lot of us and i suspect especially a lot of us in this room deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students perfectionists except that because according to this getting something wrong beth israel 's in boston so this woman comes in and she 's taken into the operating room she 's anesthetized the surgeon does his thing stitches her back up sends her out to the recovery room and she says why is the wrong side of my body in bandages well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident he said something very interesting the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient the point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world well that 's when we but it 's also a huge social problem think for a moment about what it means to feel right which is how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they 're ignorant they don 't have access to the same information that we do and when we generously share that information with them they 're going to see the light and come on over to our team which is that they 're idiots they and when that doesn 't work it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do so this is a attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to but to me what 's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human it 's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing the miracle of your mind it 's that you can see the world as it isn 't we can remember the past and we can think about the future which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this and yeah it is also why we get things wrong one thousand two hundred years before descartes said his famous thing about i think i am this guy st augustine sat down and wrote fallor ergo sum i err therefore i am augustine understood that our capacity to screw up it 's not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system something we can eradicate or overcome it 's totally fundamental to who we are because unlike god really know what 's going on out there and unlike all of the other animals we are obsessed with trying to figure it out to me this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity last year for various reasons i found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show this american life and my first thought was i 've lost it i 've become the crazy wrongness lady i just imagined it everywhere which has happened but a couple of months later i actually had a chance to interview ira glass who 's the host of the show and i mentioned this to him and he was like no actually that 's true in fact he says as a staff we joke that every single episode of our show has the same and the crypto theme is ' i thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead ' and the thing is says ira glass we need this we need these moments of we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings but you know our stories are like this because our lives are like this we think this one thing is going to happen and hosni mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of egypt for the rest of his life until he got too and maybe you thought you were going to and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody and something else happened instead i mean this is life we generate these incredible stories about the world around us and then the world turns around and astonishes us but because half the stuff that 's the most so here we are again we hold another conference and to me if you really want to rediscover wonder you need to step outside of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe i don 't know maybe i 'm wrong"
