  "transcript": "one of the biggest myths in medicine and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single solo inventor who overnight everything 's changed however it 's just not true and in many ways it always has i 'd like to share with you a story about how i 've experienced this very dramatically in my own work i 'm a surgeon and we surgeons have always had this special relationship with light and this is why traditionally surgeries have always started so early in the morning to take advantage of daylight hours and if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms they have been on top of buildings for example this is the oldest operating room in the western world in london where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in and then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in america this is mass general in boston and do you know where the room is here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in and because we no longer need to use sunlight we have very specialized lights we have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights lights that can allow we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything 's color coded arteries are red veins are blue however when we have a real patient on the table this is the same neck dissection we heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute this is how we excise cancers we do our best based upon our training but then we actually have to take samples from the surgical bed what 's left behind in the patient the pathologist takes that sample freezes it cuts it looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room and that may be twenty minutes later per piece so if you 've sent three specimens it 's an hour later and very often they say say we think the entire tumor is out but very often we get a phone call once we looked at the final specimen we actually found that there 's a couple other spots where the margins are positive there 's still cancer in your patient or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy so wouldn 't it be better if we could really tell if the surgeon could really tell whether or not there 's still cancer on the surgical field during my surgical residency i had the great fortune to meet who went on to win the nobel prize for chemistry in two thousand and eight roger and his team were working on a way to detect cancer and they had a very clever molecule that they had come up with the molecule they had developed had three parts the main part of it is the blue everything 's going to get lit up nothing will be specific there 's no specificity there so when those two are together the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down and the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors for example the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make so here in this situation if you make a solution full of this and you inject it into the vein of someone who and now boom the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent so here 's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it can you tell where the tumor is i couldn 't when i was working on this but we can tell in the operating room in the field at a molecular level and the cool thing about fluorescence is that it 's not only it actually can shine through tissue the light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue so even if the tumor is not right on the surface you 'll still be can see that the tumor is green so that 's the beauty of having a tumor that 's labeled with that you can not only see the margins right there on a molecular level but you can see it even if it 's not right on the top even if sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer melanoma women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes but when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment protocol the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection the woman would be saved from having unnecessary but sentinel lymph node the way that we do it today is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go so if you 're driving on the freeway and you want to know where 's the next there some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others that doesn 't mean that there 's the surgeon is able to tell immediately we can also use the same smart you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer even before so but equally important is to preserve things that are important for function so it 's very important to avoid inadvertent injury and what i 'm talking about are nerves nerves if they are injured can cause paralysis can cause pain up to sixty percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have urinary incontinence and erectile disfunction that 's a lot of people to have a lot of problems and this is even that they are actually never seen and they 're known because somebody has decided which means that we 're still learning about where they are crazy to think that we 're having surgery we 're trying to excise cancer we don 't know where the cancer is we 're trying to preserve nerves we can 't see where they are so i said wouldn 't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence and at first this didn 't get a lot of support we haven 't had that many complications so there 's that teamwork and when we made a solution of this tagged with the fluorescence and body of a mouse and you can see that that big fat portion you can see very easily but in fact at the tip of that where i 'm dissecting now there 's actually very fine arborizations that can 't really be seen we have been able to see nerves for facial expression for facial movement for breathing every single nerve nerves for urinary function around the prostate we 've been able to see every single nerve so here 's a tumor do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is now you do what about the nerve that 's going into this tumor that white portion there is easy to see but what about the part that goes into the tumor do you know where it 's going now you do basically we 've come up with a way to stain tissue and color code the surgical field this was a bit of a breakthrough i think that it 'll change we published our results in the proceedings of the and we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues they said wow i have patients who would benefit from this i think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence we 've discovered that there 's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a understandably the majority of the medical industry such as long term daily medications we are focused on making this technology better we 're focused on killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue successful innovation is not a single breakthrough it is not a sprint it is not an event for the solo runner and this takes the long term steady courage of and that is the light that i want to shine on health and medicine today"
