  "transcript": "i mean the word about women actually i 'm even here speaking as a middle class white man now i wasn 't always a middle class white man it all happened for me about thirty years ago when i was in graduate school and we said you know there 's an explosion of writing and thinking in feminist theory but there 's no courses yet let 's have a study group we 'll read a text we 'll talk about it we 'll have a potluck dinner so every week eleven women and me got together we would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it and during one of our conversations i witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever it was a conversation between two women one of the women was white and one was black and the white woman said this is going to sound very anachronistic now the white woman said all women face the same oppression as women all women are similarly situated in patriarchy and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood let me ask you a question so the black woman says to the white woman when you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror what do you see and the white woman said i see a woman and the black woman said you see that 's the problem for me because when i wake up in the morning and i look in the mirror she said i see a black woman to me race is visible but to you race is invisible you don 't see it and then she said something really startling she said that 's how privilege works privilege is invisible to those who have it it is a luxury i will say to the white people sitting in this room not to have to think about race every split second of our lives privilege is invisible to those who have it so when i witnessed this i went oh no i 'm kind the generic person you know i 'm a middle class white man i have no race no class no gender i 'm universally generalizable that class and race and gender were not about other people they were about me and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so i have a colleague and she and i both teach the sociology of gender course on alternate semesters and as i walk in one of the students looks up and says objective opinion i mean if you were to say to my students there is structural inequality based on gender in the united states they 'd say well of course you 'd say that you 're a woman you 're biased when i say it they go wow is that interesting is that going to be on the test how do you spell ' structural so i hope you all can see this is what objectivity looks like disembodied western rationality and that by the way is why i think men so often wear ties because if you are going to embody disembodied western rationality you need a signifier and what could be a better signifier of disembodied western rationality than a garment that at one end is a noose and the other end points to the genitals that 's just that 's the ethical some men think the lightning bolt goes off and they go oh my god yes gender equality and they will immediately begin to mansplain to you your oppression they see supporting gender equality something something akin to the cavalry like thanks very much for bringing this to our attention ladies we 'll take it from here that sees gender equality as something that is detrimental to men i was on a tv talk show opposite four white men this is the beginning of the book i wrote ' angry white men ' these were four angry white men who believed that they white men in america and the quote a black woman stole my job and then it was my turn to speak and it 's about the title of the show ' a black woman stole my job ' actually it 's about one word in the title i want to know about the word ' my ' where did you get the idea it was your job why isn 't the title of the show ' a black woman got the job ' or ' a black woman got a job ' i don 't think we 'll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality look we think this is a level playing field it 's reverse discrimination against us so let me be very clear it is called the history of the world it 's right and it 's just if you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live gender equality it turns out according to most studies and that 's not just because they 're all in europe even within europe those countries that are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness research by catalyst and others has shown has shown conclusively that the more gender equal companies are they have an easier time they have higher rates of retention higher job so the question i 'm often asked in companies is boy this gender equality thing that 's really going to be expensive huh and i say oh no in fact what you have to start calculating is how much gender inequality is already costing you it is extremely expensive and the other thing is it 's good for men and they want to have lives that are animated by terrific relationships with their children they expect their partners their spouses their wives to work outside the home and be just as committed to their careers as they are i was talking to give you an illustration of this change there was a riddle that was posed to us some of you may wince to remember this riddle this riddle went something like this and the father is killed and as they 're bringing the son into the hospital emergency room the emergency room attending physician sees the boy and says oh i can 't treat him that 's my son how is this possible we could not figure this out i decided to do a little experiment with my 16 year old son he of his friends just to see to gauge the level of change well it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships the happier both partners are but a win win now when men begin the process of we often have two phrases that we use to describe what we do we pitch in and we help out and i 'm going to propose something a little bit more radical one word share their children do better in school their children have lower rates of absenteeism higher rates of achievement they are less likely to be their wives are happier their wives are less likely to see a therapist less likely to be diagnosed with depression less likely to be put on medication more likely to go to the gym drink less and who wouldn 't they have more sex now of these four fascinating findings which one do you think men 's health magazine put on its cover housework makes her horny not when she does it now i will say just to remind so i don 't want that when men 's health magazine put it on their cover they also called that gender equality is in the interest of countries of companies that gender equality is not a zero sum game it 's not a win lose it is a win win for everyone and what we also know is we cannot fully empower women and girls unless we we know this and my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen on the eve of one of the great suffrage demonstrations down fifth avenue in new york city writer in in new york wrote an article in a magazine and the title of the article was feminism for men and this was the first line of that article feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free"
