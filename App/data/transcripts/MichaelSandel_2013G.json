  "transcript": "what should be the role of money today there are very few things that money can 't buy if you 're sentenced to a jail term in santa barbara california you should know that if you don 't like the standard accommodations you can buy a prison cell upgrade five hundred dollars it 's not the you go to an amusement park and don 't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides there is now in many theme parks you can pay extra in washington d c long lines queues sometimes form for now so now for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don 't like to wait there are companies you can pay them a certain amount of money they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes and the lobbyist just before the hearing begins can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room in bigger arenas did you know that in iraq and afghanistan there were more private military contractors on the ground now this isn 't because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies we have lived through a quiet revolution we 've drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy the difference is this a market economy is a tool but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale it why worry about our becoming for two reasons i think the more things the more affluence or the lack of it matters if the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or bmws but when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life decent health care political voice and influence in campaigns when money comes to govern all of those things and so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and that 's one reason to worry there 's a second reason apart from the worry about inequality and it 's this with some social goods and practices when market thinking and market values enter they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism a cash incentive and see what you think about it many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds to study hard to do well in school to apply themselves some economists have proposed a market solution offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books they 've tried this actually they 've done some experiments in in chicago in washington d c they 've tried this offering fifty dollars for an a dollars for a b in dallas texas they have a program that offers eight year olds two dollars for each book they read so let 's see what some people are in favor some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement let 's see what people here think about it imagine that you are the head of a major school system how many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try let 's see by a show of hands first how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work raise your hand and how many would be opposed how many would so the majority here are opposed but a sizable minority are in favor let 's have a discussion let 's start with those of you who object who would rule it out even before trying what would be your reason who will get our discussion yes heike moses hello everyone i 'm heike and i think it just kills the intrinsic motivation if they would like to read you just take this incentive away in just paying them so it just changes behavior michael sandel takes the intrinsic incentive away what and then if you stop paying them what happens then then they stop reading ms now let 's see if there 's someone who favors who thinks it 's worth trying this elizabeth loftus i 'm elizabeth loftus and you said worth a try so why not try it and do the experiment and and what would you measure you 'd measure how how many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them ms oh after you stopped paying all i just think this is not to offend anyone a very american way ms all right what 's emerged from this discussion is the following question will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation the intrinsic which is to learn to love to learn and to read and people disagree about what the effect will be but that seems to be the question that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive i should tell you what 's happened with these experiments the cash for good grades has had very mixed results for the most part has not resulted in higher grades the two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books it also led them to read shorter books but the real question is what will become of these kids later will they have learned that reading is a chore a form of piecework to be done for pay that 's the worry or may it brings out is something that many economists overlook economists often assume that markets are inert that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange market exchange they assume doesn 't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged this may be true enough if we 're talking about material goods if you sell me a flat screen television but the same may not be true if we 're talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring about once we see that markets and commerce when extended beyond the material domain change the character of the goods can change the meaning of the social practices as in the example of teaching and learning we have to ask where markets belong and where they don 't where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about but to have this debate debate we have to do something we 're not very good at and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practices we prize from our bodies to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning now these are controversial and so we tend to shrink from them when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out empty of larger moral meaning for fear of disagreement we shrink from these but once we see we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods one of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything is on commonality the sense that we are all in it against the background of rising inequality every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate we live and work and shop and play in different places our children go to different schools nor is it a satisfying way to live even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line here 's why democracy does not require perfect equality but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life what matters is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life because this is what and this is how and so in the end the question of markets is not mainly an economic question it 's really a question of how we want to live together do we want a society or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor thank you very much"
