  "transcript": "nose and gums death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure if you 're thinking this is ebola actually in this case it 's not it 's an extreme form of dengue fever a mosquito born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine and kills twenty two thousand each year that is actually twice the number of people that have been killed by ebola in the nearly four decades that we 've known about it as for measles so much in the news recently the death toll is actually tenfold higher clearly there is something deeply rooted about it we may have it someday so we rightfully fear ebola because it it doesn 't kill as many people as other diseases in fact it 's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles we fear ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can 't treat it we fear the certain inevitability that comes with ebola but wait a second why is that we 've known about ebola since one thousand nine and in fact we 've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now it goes something like this the people most at risk for these diseases are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines this leaves little in the way of market incentives for it 's simply too commercially risky as for ebola there is absolutely no market at all so the only reason we have two vaccines in late stage clinical trials now is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear was relatively ignored until september eleven and the anthrax attacks when all of a sudden people perceived ebola as potentially a bioterrorism weapon well partially because it was really difficult or to be difficult to weaponize the virus but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it and this is really the point the sad reality is we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines vaccine development is expensive and complicated it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers the first is to recognize when there 's a complete market failure we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens the data from that then can be used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed so for ebola the paranoid fear of an infectious disease followed by and with the work of dedicated we now have these two ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the ebola countries we spend billions of dollars keeping a fleet we spend virtually nothing and make no mistake about it it 's not a question of if but when these bugs are going to continue to evolve and they 're going to threaten the world so if we want to be able to to prevent but at the same time praying we never have to use it"
