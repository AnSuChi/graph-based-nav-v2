  "transcript": "sometimes i make a lot of drawings and i still don 't understand what it is i 'm drawing those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is is best known for the way things work while preparing for part of a panel for called understanding spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new cd burner i 've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me instructions but i did finally figure it out i had to figure it out because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector now i could talk about something that i 'm known for something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here i could talk about something i really care about i decided to go with the latter i 'm going i went to rhode island school of design in the second half of the ' 60s to study architecture i was lucky enough to spend my last year my fifth year in rome as a changed my life not i missed the ' 60s i read about them but i did spend that extraordinary year in rome and it 's a place that is never far from my mind so whenever given an opportunity i try to do something in it or with it or for it i also make drawings to help people understand things things that i want them to believe i understand so i 'm going to show you some pictures of rome i 've made a lot of drawings of rome over the years these are just drawings of rome i get back as often as possible i need to all different part of the reason i 'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process i go through of trying to figure out what it is i feel about rome and why i feel it these are sketches of some of the little details rome is a city full of surprises i mean we 're talking about unusual perspectives we 're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast piazzas never though piazzas that are not humanly scaled the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that 's traveling above your head of usually blue especially in the summer compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets and i began to think about how i could communicate this in book form how could i share my the primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you 're not quite sure where you 're going you 're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency here 's a little map and i thought of maps at the beginning maybe i should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in rome and here 's a maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this maybe i should get away from this map completely and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air which happens in so many of the squares in the city and let it bounce off of things and i 'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits that seemed like a sort of a cheap shot but even though i just started this presentation this is not the first thing that i tried to do and i was getting sort of desperate eventually i realized that i had really no content i could count on so i decided to move towards packaging i mean it seems to work for for a lot of things so but one of the ideas that emerged from from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter and very slow walking through rome you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across anyways i went back to the dirigible notion went to alberto one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so i could actually use it as a scale that i would then juxtapose with some of the things in rome this thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of but it would be like having a ruler sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler if you were interested this is beatrix she has a dog ajax is sniffing for holes in the in the balloon before they set off she launches this thing above the spanish steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city over the spanish steps we go a nice way to show that that unfortunately just across the road from it or quite quite close by is the the column of marcus aurelius and the diameter this gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the column of marcus aurelius which is really more than a pile of quarters high thick quarters over the piazza of saint ignacio completely ruining the symmetry but that aside a spectacular place to visit a spectacular framework inside of which you see usually extraordinary blue sky over the pantheon and the 26 foot diameter oculus she parks her dirigible lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for the text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view looking in the hole getting a different kind of perspective moving you around the space particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the oculus unfortunately for her the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some boy scouts who are visiting the pantheon and they are immediately yanked out which would from their point of view naturally be hanging upside down notices a lot of activity at the tre scalini restaurant is reminded that it is lunchtime and she 's hungry the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff makes a lunge for it she 's managed to save the prosciutto but in the process she loses the tablecloth which you can see left hand corner they continue without their tablecloth looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch they eventually discover a huge wall that 's filled with small holes ideal for docking a dirigible because you 've got a place to tie up so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view at the end of lunch they untie the anchor they set off through the baths of caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the pyramid of cestius which has this lightning rod on top unfortunately that 's a problem they get a little too close and when you 're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes so that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion marcello on the other hand is sort of a lazy guy but he 's not due at work until about noon so the alarm goes off and it down the alleys through the disturbing the quiet backstreet life of rome at every turn that speed with which he is moving i hope i have he keeps on moving approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table and marcello keeps moving in his scooter everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine but keeps on moving because this guy 's got a job to do removes some scaffolding one of the reasons rome remains the extraordinary place it is that right through the piazza della rotonda in front of the pantheon again wreaking havoc and finally getting to work marcello as it turns out is the driver if you 've been on the number sixty four bus you know that it 's driven with the same kind of exuberance as marcello demonstrated on his scooter and finally carletto you see his apartment in the upper left hand corner he 's looking at his table he 's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of forty years and something 's wrong everybody knows which is why people know him arrives at the big front door nobody 's tvs are working and there 's a big soccer game coming up and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous he goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building apartment by he also solves his own problem all he has to do now with a perfect table is wait for her to arrive that was the first attempt didn 't seem substantial enough to to convey whatever it was i wanted to convey about rome so i thought well i 'll just do piazzas and i 'll get inside and underneath and i 'll show these things growing and show why they 're shaped the way they are and so on and then i thought that 's too complicated no i 'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and i 'll put them inside the pantheon but keep the scale now that 's one drawing so i thought maybe it 's time for piranesi to meet escher laughter you see that i 'm beginning to really lose control here and also also hope there 's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together not only a neat way of collecting and storing information it 's a series of layers i mean you always peel one layer off another we think of them as pages doing it a certain way but think of them as layers i mean rome is a place of layers well just peeling off a page would allow me to if i got you thinking about it the right would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers the stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in rome covers the scars the scars of left hand side and let you just unfold it you see behind it what i mean by scar tissue you can see that in one thousand six hundred and thirty five it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever adaptations all get buried under the stucco i could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what 's going on inside of it but more importantly i could also which is more often the case those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold double foldout page which if you were like me reading a pop up book as a child you hopefully stick your head into you wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time and i 've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages i thought maybe i could be simpler here we 're looking down the front of the pantheon and we 're looking sort of at the top that seemed promising i thought maybe i 'll do it inside and i can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book so we get inside the pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth and i thought maybe i 'm on the right track but it sort of lost its human quality so i went back to the notion of story which is always a good thing to have if you 're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way pigeon 's progress struck me a catchy title if it was a homing pigeon it would be called homer 's odyssey but it was the journey of the i if a title works use it but it would be a journey that went through rome and showed all the things that i like about rome it 's a pigeon sitting on top of a church goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff another place to live and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things and we start with the tall ones and so on maybe it has to go back and live with family members that 's not always a good thing but it does sort of bring bring pigeons together again and i thought that 's sort of interesting but maybe there 's a person who should be involved in this in some way so i kind of came up with this old guy who his life looking after sick pigeons he 'll go anywhere to get them dangerous places and whatnot and they become really friends with this guy and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that there 's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons but unfortunately he gets sick he gets really sick at the end of the story he 's taught them to spell his name which is aldo they show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him he lives in this little garret and and a la red balloon are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city and i forgot to mention this whenever he lost a pigeon he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city in the old roman custom the dead were never buried within the walls and i thought that 's a really cheery story going to go a long way so anyway i went through and if packaging doesn 't work and if the stories aren 't going anywhere i just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction and sometimes it does focus me enough and i 'll even do a title page so these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution i settled on which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon she lives outside the walls of the city of rome to someone in the city and the pigeon is flying down above the appian way here you can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way if you see the red line you are seeing the trail of the pigeon if you don 't see the red line you are the pigeon and it becomes necessary and possible at this point to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually past the pyramid of cestius these will seem very familiar to you even if you haven 't been to rome recently past the gatehouse this is something that 's a little bit unusual this pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do it takes the scenic route which was a device that i felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four we almost collide with the cornice of the palazzo farnese built of stone taken from the coliseum narrow escape we swoop down over the campo de ' fiori this is one of those things i show to my students because it 's a complete bastardization a denial of any rules of perspective but you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here a a couple of others in cremona but into the the piazza in front of santa maria della pace where invariably a soccer game is going on and we 're hit by a soccer so i had to rethink it incredibly interactive just turn it around and look at it the other way through the alley we can see the impact is is and then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower one of the few remaining medieval towers towards the church of 'agnese and around the dome looking down into piazza navona which we 've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times there 's the bernini statue of the four rivers 26 foot diameter oculus of the pantheon to catch our breath and then we can swoop inside and around and because we 're flying we don 't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page"
