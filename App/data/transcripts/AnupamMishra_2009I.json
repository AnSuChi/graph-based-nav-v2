  "transcript": "please switch off if you are feet deep one and in most parts it is saline not fit for drinking but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps they are of no use but we find forty different names of clouds in this dialect used here there are a number of techniques to but for the desert society this is no this is their life and they it 's called kunds somewhere it is called [ unclear ] and you can notice and this is all big raised platform you can and there is a slope sometimes our engineers and architects and the water will go where it should go and then it is forty feet waterproofing is done perfectly better than our city because not a single drop should go waste in this they collect one below the surface but now you can have this for year round it 's two houses and the water storage tanks these raised up platforms just like this stage it can also harvest something like twenty five thousand in a another big one this is of course out of the this is near jaipur this is since four hundred years it has been giving you it draws water from fifteen kilometers of hardly fifty years old it is maintained for so many generations of course if you want to go inside the two doors are locked but they can be opened for ted people you can see person coming up with two canisters of water and the water level these are not empty canisters water level is right up to this it can envy many municipalities the taste the purity of this water and this is what they call zero b type of water because it comes from the clouds pure distilled water the government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring dollar project to bring water from the himalayas that 's why i said that this is a commercial break so water from three hundred four hundred kilometers away soon it become like this in many portions water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything of course there are some areas where water is i 'm not saying that it is not reaching at all but the tail end the jaisalmer the the bonus is that you can find wildlife around it canal came and it became a dream also because and people started renovating their own structures but you can see that no woman is standing on those this was the terminal point for silk route well connected eight hundred years ago through none of us were able to go to europe but jaisalmer was well connected to it and this is the and highest somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here or if you want to paint can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit but apart from this system they designed beautiful water bodies around this town and what we call private public partnership you can add estate also so estate public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful and you will admire it just behold the beauty throughout but you can see how the traditional society combines marvelous statues gives you an idea of water table when this rain comes and the water starts everybody and then they will come and worship another small water body called the [ unclear ] it is difficult to translate in english especially in my english but the nearest would be glory a reputation the reputation in desert of this small water water body is that it never dries up they they knew the but perhaps they knew that on sixth november two thousand and nine there will be a ted green and blue session so they painted it like this this is called kund we have in english it squeeze the moisture hidden in the dubbed this water as the third one called [ unclear ] and and it was deposited by the great mother earth some this is the same dry water body now you don 't find any but when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year this year they have received and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your we can give you water and also maintaining them without any funding so the secret not personal property don 't spit don 't do anything wrong so that the clean water can be collected another pillar stone pillar on your right side this was and you have to go further down they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can say a you will find new stairs if it comes up some of them will be submerged this beautiful system will give you some pleasure three sides such steps on the fourth side there is the best architects because of their forefathers india could get the first engineering college in there were no english medium schools at that time which came here for business a very dirty kind of business first engineering college was created in a small village not in the town the last point we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert so look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater and also create something through a tire from tattoo was at one time a kind of a blacklisted or con thing but now it is in thing applause you can copy this tattoo i have some posters of this these are the beautiful stairs which we just and these are the flowers which add fragrance do you believe that they can be used elsewhere that the world can learn from this or is this just right for this place the open bodies are everywhere right from sri lanka to there are two which uses the gypsum belt for that you have to go back to your calendar three million otherwise it can 't be done"
