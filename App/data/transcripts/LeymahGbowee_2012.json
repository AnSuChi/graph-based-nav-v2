  "transcript": "and people ask me questions about the challenges my moments some of my i went to do a job as a research assistant i and as part of the work the village would give you and they gave me lodging with a single mother this girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it she was the laughing stock of the community her mother was often told by other women you and your child will die poor after two weeks of working in that village it was i wish for her to be a nurse i couldn 't afford to with tears in my eyes i said i go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief and all day she the meaning of her name is pig her mother died while giving birth to her and no one had any idea who her father was i bought her used clothes and bought her her first i wish to go to school i again said no two months later both of those villages fell till today i have no idea where those two girls are the minister of gender liberia called me and she had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months she came to me bloated very pale i wish to go to school a young woman stands before president sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together she 's highly athletic her wish of being educated is she goes to school on the first day the director of sports who 's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class and for the next three years her fate will be having sex with him work leaders great people have made commitments we will protect our children from want and from fear the u n has the convention on the rights of the child countries like america we 've heard things like no child left behind other countries come with different things there is a millennium development called three that focuses on all of these great works by great people i think has failed teen prostitution is at its peak in one community we 're you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper girls as young as twelve being prostituted for less than a dollar a night it and then someone asked me just before my tedtalk a few days ago so where is the hope several years ago a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women it we created a space called the young girls transformative project we go into rural communities and all we do like has been done in this room is create the space space when these girls sit you unlock passion you unlock commitment you unlock focus you unlock great leaders today and some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps as young mothers to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women enrolled in college one day she said to me my wish is to finish college and be able to support my she sells water sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones and you would think she would take that money and put it back juanita is her name she takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school my wish has been fulfilled several years ago this young girl a movement i fearlessly spoke not only this young woman wished for other things to happen it happened for her this young woman is me a nobel laureate i 'm now on a journey we set up a foundation i 've also been to places in this u s and i know that girls in this country also have wishes a wish for a better life somewhere in the bronx a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown l a a wish for a better life somewhere in texas a wish for a better life somewhere in new york a wish for a better life somewhere in new jersey will you journey with me to help that girl be it an african girl or an american girl achieve that dream because all of these great innovators and inventors that we 've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world and all they 're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence unlock the passion unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves issue that troubles you to lead the liberian reconciliation initiative as part of my work i 'm doing these tours in different villages and towns thirteen fifteen hours on dirt roads and there is no community that i 've gone into that i haven 't seen intelligent of a great future or the dream of a great future is just a dream so what troubles me is that i was at that place and somehow i 'm at this place and i just want to be the only one at this place and maybe just maybe saying because of that nobel laureate i 'm here today so i 'm troubled when i see them like there 's no hope because i know it doesn 't take a lot to get them charged up ca tell us one hopeful thing that you 've seen happening lg i can tell you many hopeful things that i 've seen happening but in the last year where president sirleaf comes from her village we went there to work with these girls and we could not find we took fifty of those girls this is one place where women were never even the older ones barely sat in the circle with these girls banded together and formed a group this is a real rural village and the theme they used was even pretty girls vote they were able to mobilize young women but not only did they do that they went to those who were running for seats to ask them what is it that you will give the girls of this community one of the guys who already had a seat and when the girls started engaging him he was very hostile towards them these little girls turned to him and said we will vote you out of office he 's out of office today"
