  "transcript": "and i found myself in the places where people are fighting every day to survive and can 't even obtain a meal but what i 'd like to talk about today is the fact that this morning about a billion people on earth or one out of every seven woke up and didn 't even know how to fill this cup one out of every seven people first i 'll ask you why should you care why should we care for most people if they think about hunger they don 't have to go far back on their own family maybe in their own lives or their parents ' lives or their grandparents ' lives feel it 's perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity as gandhi said to a hungry man a piece of bread is the face of god stability in the world one of the most fundamental others think about malthusian nightmares will we be able to feed but i actually came to this issue in a different way this is a picture i was a new mother with my first child and was holding her and feeding her when an image very similar to this came and this was yet another famine in ethiopia one two years earlier had killed more than a million people but it never struck me as it did that moment because on that image was a woman trying to nurse nurse her baby and she had no milk and i thought there 's nothing more haunting than the cry of a child that cannot be returned and it was at that moment that i just was filled with with the challenge and the outrage that actually we know how to fix this problem this isn 't one of those rare diseases that we don 't have the solution for and i was just struck that this is out of place at our time in history yet again the face of starvation at large scale with more than nine million people wondering if they can make it to the next day in fact what we know now is that every ten seconds this is more and we know but today i 'm going to talk about access to food because actually this year and last year and during the two thousand and eight food crisis there was enough food on earth for everyone to have two thousand seven hundred kilocalories so why is it lancet compiled all the research and put forward the compelling evidence that if a child in its first thousand days from conception and here you see a brain scan of two children one who had adequate nutrition another neglected and who was deeply malnourished and we can see brain volumes up to forty percent less in these children and in this slide you see the neurons but also the earning potential of these children is cut in half in their lifetime due to the stunting that happens in early years and yet in many places a third of the children by the time they 're three already are facing a life of some of the things i 've learned in bringing my economic and trade knowledge and my experience in the private sector i you may be surprised to know that a child could be saved every but in niger for example less than seven percent of the children are breastfed this is something that can be transformed with knowledge this message this word can come out that this is not an old fashioned way of doing business it 's a brilliant way and so today we focus on not just passing out food but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment the second thing i 'd like to talk about if you were living in a remote your child was limp and you were in a drought or you were in floods or you were in a situation where there wasn 't adequate diversity of diet what would you do do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars like we can and i go to those if there are any or out to the fields to see what they can get and they cannot obtain the nutrition even if they know what they need to do it 's not available and i 'm very excited about this because one thing and this is made with chickpeas dried milk and a host of vitamins matched to exactly what the brain needs it costs seventeen cents for us to produce this we did this with food technologists in india and pakistan really about three of them but this is transforming ninety nine percent of the kids who get this one package seventeen cents a day their malnutrition is overcome so i am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods when disaster strikes floods war conflict bad governance all of those things there is nothing to fall back on and usually the and if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers you have a transformative effect many kids in the world can 't go to school because they have to go beg and find a meal but when that food is there it 's transformative it costs less than but what is most amazing is the effect on girls in countries where girls don 't go to school because it 's incentive and we find that if we keep girls in school later they 'll stay in school until they 're sixteen and won 't get married if there 's food in school or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week it costs about fifty cents will keep a girl in school and they 'll give birth to a healthier child because the malnutrition is sent generation to generation we know that there 's boom and bust cycles of absolutely not i 'd cameroon northern cameroon boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons we decided let 's transform the model of fighting hunger and instead of giving out the food aid we put it into food banks and we said listen during the lean season take the food out you manage the village manages these warehouses and during harvest put it back with interest food interest so add in five percent ten percent more food five hundred of these villages where these are have not needed any food aid they 're self sufficient and the food banks are growing and they 're starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village but they 've never had the ability to build even the basic infrastructure or the resources and simple ideas can transform technology is transforming the face of food vulnerability in places where you see classic famine amartya sen won his nobel prize for saying guess what famines happen in the presence of food because people have no ability to buy it we certainly saw that in two thousand and eight we 're seeing that now in the horn of africa where food prices are up two hundred and forty percent in some areas over last year food can be there and people can 't buy it well this picture i was in hebron in a small shop this shop where instead of bringing in food and what 's happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry where this card 's used for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus the shopkeepers are hiring more people it is a win win win situation that starts transforming even the the presence of refugees refugees in countries and other ways perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that bill which is to ask the question what if instead of looking at the hungry as victims and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families what if we view them as the solution as the value chain to fight hunger what if from the women in africa who cannot sell any food there 's no roads there 's no warehouses there 's not even a tarp to pick the food up with what if we give the enabling environment for them to provide the food to feed the hungry children and purchasing for progress today is in twenty one countries and guess what when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market if you say we will buy three hundred metric tons of this we 'll pick it up we 'll make sure it 's stored properly because it 's the first guaranteed opportunity they 've had in their life and we 're seeing people transform their lives today food aid our food aid total transformation that can actually transform the very lives that need the food and what i 've found is rather than investing their money in food subsidies and other things they invested in a school feeding program and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity and this 5 percent of gdp and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty and it 's at scale and it 's creating opportunities i 've gone out there i 've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this now if we look at the economic imperative here this isn 't just the fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger the cost to society the burden it has to bear and in some countries up to eleven percent of gdp a year well the world bank estimates it would take ten billion dollars to address malnutrition in those countries you look at the cost benefit analysis and my dream is to take this issue not just from the compassion argument but to the finance ministers of the world and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate affordable nutrition for all of humanity the amazing thing i 've found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader when a leader says not under my watch everything begins to change and the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this and the fact that france has put because food is one issue that cannot be solved and we 're seeing nations in africa wfp 's been able to leave thirty nations thirty nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations what i would like to offer here is a challenge living at a time in human history where it 's just simply unacceptable that children wake up and don 't know where to find a cup of food not only that transforming hunger but i think we have to change our mindsets and i would like you to join with all of humanity to draw a line in the sand and say no more but that exists no more thank you"
