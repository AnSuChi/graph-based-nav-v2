  "transcript": "was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future he 'd spent ten thousand dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars ambitious men business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate ninety five percent of the guys that i was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside but when they talked about what they did they talked about it in a different jargon but the business concepts that they talked about weren 't unlike those that you 'd learn in a first year mba class at wharton you never charge a first time user contrary to what most people think people toothbrush toothpaste all of it and it that was my full time job unloading trucks at a food warehouse you pay everything in stamps those are the currency you charge another inmate to clean his cell like you run a barbershop out of your cell which you smuggle sculpting people 's hair with toenail clippers or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs prisoners learn how to make do with less and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they 've learned to the outside but no one to help them write a business plan figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into no access to the internet even when they come out most states don 't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background so none of us should be surprised that two out of three i lost a year of my life from it but when i came out i vowed that i was going to do whatever i could to make sure that guys like the ones i was locked up with didn 't have to waste any more of their life than they already had"
