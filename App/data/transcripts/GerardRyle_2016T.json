  "transcript": "you do if you had to figure out verify it and make sense of it an anonymous person calling himself john doe had somehow managed to copy nearly forty years of records of the panamanian law firm mossack fonseca this is one of many firms around the world that specialize in setting up accounts in offshore tax havens like the british virgin islands for rich and powerful people who like to keep secrets john doe had managed to copy every to the present day but it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism think about it eleven point five million containing the secrets of people from more than two hundred different countries where do you start with such a vast resource where do you even begin to tell a story and that can affect almost any person in any language sometimes in ways they don 't even know yet john doe had given the information to two journalists at the german newspaper sddeutsche zeitung he said he was motivated by and i quote the scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal but one user alone can never make sense of such a vast amount of information so the sddeutsche zeitung reached out to my organization in washington dc the international consortium of investigative journalists we decided to do something that was the very opposite of everything we 'd been taught to do as journalists share but there 's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world and that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this environmental and health crises are global so too are financial flows and financial crises and it also seems staggering that journalism has been so slow to wake up to the possibilities rather than being frightened of it the advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken and this has plunged journalism into crisis those institutions the first challenge presented by what would eventually become known as the panama papers was to make the documents searchable and readable and millions more files and other kinds of documents we next invited reporters to have a look at the documents in all reporters from more than one hundred media organizations in seventy six countries from the bbc in britain to le monde newspaper in france to the asahi shimbun in japan native eyes on native names we called it the idea being who best to tell you who was important to nigeria than a nigerian journalist who best in canada than a canadian we chose our media partners based on trust that had been built up through previous smaller collaborations and also from leads that jumped out from the documents over the next few months my small nonprofit organization of less than twenty people was joined by more than three hundred and fifty other reporters from twenty five language groups the biggest information leak in history had now spawned the biggest journalism collaboration in history sets of native eyes doing what journalists normally never do working shoulder to shoulder sharing information but telling no one we first needed the biggest kind of silence and we built a specially designed search engine the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging from the documents those interested in blood diamonds or exotic art for instance could share information about how the offshore world was being used to hide the trade in both of those commodities those interested in sport could share information about how famous sports stars were putting their image rights into offshore companies likely avoiding taxes in the countries where they plied their trade but perhaps most exciting of all were the number of world leaders and elect politicians that were emerging from the documents close associates of vladimir putin in russia and the british prime minister buried in the documents wintris inc i like to refer to johannes kristjansson the icelandic reporter we invited to join the project as the loneliest man in the world for nine months he refused paid work and lived off the earnings of his wife he pasted tarps over the windows of his home to prevent prying eyes during the long icelandic winter as he worked red eyed night after night month after month in all that time he sat on information that would eventually bring down the leader of his country when you 're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery such as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company that that company has a financial interest in icelandic banks the very issue he 's been elected on well your instinct is to scream out very loud instead as one of the few people that and then they turned those screams into stories by going outside the documents to court records and by eventually putting questions those that we intended to name panama papers actually unconnected to us a major political bribery scandal happened in brazil the fbi began to indict officials at fifa organization that controls the world of professional soccer the panama papers actually had unique insights into each one of these unfolding events so you can imagine the pressure but they didn 't and on april this is the scene in iceland the day after we the most famous soccer player in the world and there were some unintended consequences these alleged members of a mexican drug cartel were arrested after we published details about their hideout they 'd been using the address to register their offshore company the technology the internet and this dynamic is producing unprecedented levels of transparency and impact we showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world by applying new methods and old fashioned journalism techniques and by sharing resources we were able to dig deep much deeper and it wouldn 't work for every story but we showed with the panama papers that you can write about shortly after we published i got a three word text from johannes i guess you 're going to send that applause to the three hundred and fifty journalists in secrecy for over a year with colleagues from all over the world was there ever a moment when you thought that the leak may be leaked that the collaboration may just be broken by somebody publishing a story or somebody not in the group releasing some information that they got to know gerard ryle we had a series of of crises along the way including when something major was happening in the world we 'd sent a series of questions to the associates of vladimir putin i guess a plot from the west and of course a lot of editors around the world were very nervous about this they thought the story was going to get out you can imagine the amount of time they 'd spent the amount of resources money spent on this so i had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down a bit like a general where you 're holding your troops back remain calm and then eventually of course they all did bg and then couple weeks ago or so you released a lot of the documents as an open database for everybody to search via keyword essentially gr we very much believe that that the basic information about the offshore world should be made public now we didn 't publish the underlying documents of the journalists we 're working with but the basic information such as the name of a person what their offshore company was and the name of that company is now all available online in fact the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now"
