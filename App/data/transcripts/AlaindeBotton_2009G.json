  "transcript": "sunday evening just as the sun is starting to set and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that i normally end up i 'm mentioning all but i think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises by moments when what we thought we knew about our lives about our careers comes into contact with free of career anxiety i want to look now if i may at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers why we might be victims of these career crises as we 're weeping softly into our pillows one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by 've got some bad news particularly to anybody who 's come to oxford from abroad there 's a real problem with snobbery because sometimes people from outside the u k imagine that snobbery is a distinctively u k phenomenon we are a global organization this is a global phenomenon what is a snob a snob is anybody who takes a small part of you the dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery you encounter it within minutes at a party when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early what do you do according to how you answer that question people are either incredibly delighted to see you or look at their watch and make their excuses now the opposite of a snob is your mother most people make a strict correlation that will be strictly and that 's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods you know we 're often told that we live in very materialistic times that we 're all greedy people i don 't think we are particularly materialistic i think we live in a society which has simply pegged it 's not the material goods we want it 's the rewards we want it 's a new way of looking at luxury goods the next time you see somebody driving a ferrari don 't think this is somebody who 's greedy think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love there are other reasons there are other reasons why it 's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before one never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan we 're told we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please and it 's a beautiful along with that is a kind of spirit of equality we 're all and that problem is envy let me explain i think it would be very unusual for anyone here or anyone watching to be envious of the queen of england even though the reason why we don 't envy her is because she 's too weird she 's simply too strange and when you can 't relate to somebody you don 't envy them the closer two people are in age in background in the process of identification the more there 's a danger of envy which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion because there is no stronger reference point than people one one was at school with the problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school everybody 's wearing jeans everybody 's the same and yet they 're not so which can make for a very stressful situation it 's probably as unlikely it 's made to feel by magazines and other media outlets that if you 've got energy a few bright ideas about technology a garage you too could start a major thing laughter the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops when you go to a large bookshop and look at the self help sections as i sometimes do if you analyze self help books produced in the world today there are basically two kinds kinds the first kind tells you you can do it you can make it anything 's possible the other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call low or impolitely call feeling very bad about yourself there 's self esteem so that 's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback there is another reason why we and that nice thing is called meritocracy and we should all be trying to make our societies really really meritocratic the problem is if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top get to the top you 'll also by implication and in a far more nasty way believe in a society where those who in other words your position in life comes to seem not accidental but merited and deserved in england when you met a very poor person that person would be described as an unfortunate literally somebody who had not been blessed by fortune an unfortunate nowadays particularly in the united states if you meet someone at the bottom of society they may unkindly be described as a there 's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser and that shows four hundred years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives it 's no longer the gods in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally they own their success but they also own their failure let 's take meritocracy this idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to i think it 's a crazy idea completely crazy i will support any politician of left and right with any but i think it 's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic it 's an impossible dream the idea that we will make a society where literally accidents accidents of birth things dropping on people 's heads illnesses etc we will never get to grade them never get to grade people as they should i 'm drawn to a lovely quote by st augustine in the city of god where he says it 's a sin to judge any man by his post it 's not the post that should count according to st augustine only god can but something very valuable in that idea hold your horses when you 're coming to judge people you don 't necessarily know and they are described as now is there any alternative to this i think the western tradition shows us one glorious alternative which is tragedy as it developed in the theaters of ancient greece in the fifth century b c was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail and which ordinary would not necessarily accord them a few years ago i was thinking about this and i went to the sunday sport a tabloid newspaper i don 't recommend you start reading if you 're not familiar with it already i wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a saturday afternoon i mentioned othello they 'd not heard of it but were fascinated and they wrote shopaholic adulteress swallows arsenic after credit fraud and then my favorite they really do have a kind of genius of their own these guys my favorite is sophocles he is not a though he has lost and i think that is the message of tragedy to us and why it 's so very very important i think the other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety is that we have nothing at its center that is non human we are the first society to be living in a world where we don 't worship anything other than ourselves we think very highly of ourselves and so we should we 've put people on the moon done all sorts of extraordinary things that 's a very new situation we 've slightly lost the habit of doing that which is i think why we 're particularly drawn to nature but because it 's an escape from the human anthill it 's an escape from our own competition and our own dramas and that 's why we enjoy looking at we like to feel in contact with something that is non human and that is so deeply and one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it if i said that there 's somebody behind the screen who 's very very successful certain ideas would immediately come to mind you 'd think that person might have made a lot of money achieved renown in some field but as i get older i 'm also very nuanced about what that word success might mean here 's an insight that i 've had about success you can 't be successful at everything we hear a lot of talk about and i think any wise life will accept as i say and the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about eighty years no one 's quite listening hard enough but i very much believe it 's true and we also suck in messages from everything from the television these are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves we are highly open to suggestion but we should make sure that they are our own we should focus in on our ideas and but it 's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want and find out at the end of the journey that it isn 't in fact what you wanted all along so i 'm going to end it there but what i really want to but let 's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas let 's probe away at our notions of success let 's make sure our ideas of that was fascinating but how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a the idea that a lot of people like of seizing control of your life and that a society that encourages that perhaps has to have some winners and losers alain de botton i just think that it 's impossible we should do everything we can to pursue it but we should always remember that whoever is facing us that 's what i 'm trying to leave room for otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic ca i mean do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy or do you think that you can 't but it doesn 't matter that much that we 're putting too much emphasis on that ab the nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them and that somehow the crueler the environment the more people will rise to the challenge you want to think who would you like as your ideal dad and your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle and it 's a very hard line to make we need fathers as it were the avoiding the two extremes which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand and on the other the lax"
