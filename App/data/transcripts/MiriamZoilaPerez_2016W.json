  "transcript": "and my breath is a little bit shallow now these familiar sensations are obviously the result of standing up in front of a thousand of you and giving a talk that might be streamed online to perhaps a million more but the physical sensations i 'm experiencing right now are actually the result of a much more basic mind body mechanism my nervous system is sending a flood of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline into my bloodstream it 's a very old and very necessary response but there 's a problem with this response and that is it can get if i face these kinds of stressors on a daily basis particularly over an extended period of time so basically if this response happens infrequently there 's a growing body of research examining the relationship between chronic stress and illness things like heart disease and even cancer are being shown to have a relationship to stress and that 's because over time too much activation from stress can interfere with my body 's processes that keep me healthy let 's imagine for a moment that i was pregnant what might this kind of stress particularly over the length of my pregnancy what kind of impact might that have on the health of my developing fetus you probably won 't be surprised when i tell you that this kind of stress during pregnancy is not good because in a basic sense the stress communicates now of course stress particularly in our modern lifestyle maybe you 've never stood up to give a ted talk but you 've faced a big presentation at work a sudden job loss but it turns out that the kind of stress we experience and whether we 're able to stay in a relaxed state long enough to keep our bodies working properly depends a lot on who we are there 's also a growing body of research showing that people who experience more discrimination are more likely to have poor health even the threat of discrimination like worrying you might be stopped by police while driving your car the person who pioneered the tools that have proven these says that the more marginalized groups in our society experience more discrimination and more impacts on their health i 've been interested in these issues for over a decade i became interested in maternal health when a failed premed trajectory instead sent me down a path looking for other ways to help pregnant people i became a doula a lay person trained to provide support to people during pregnancy and because i 'm latina and a spanish speaker in my first volunteer doula gig at a public hospital in north carolina i saw clearly how race and class impacted the experiences of the women that i supported if we take a look at the statistics about the rates of illness during pregnancy and childbirth we see clearly the pattern outlined by dr williams african american women in particular have an entirely different experience than white women when it comes to whether their babies are born healthy the rates of mother and infant death for black women actually approximate those rates in sub saharan african even nationally black women are four times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women four times more likely to die native women are also more likely to have higher rates of these problems than white women as are some groups of latinas but when i tell people about these appalling statistics i 'm usually met with an assumption that it 's about either poverty or lack of access to even middle class black women still have much worse outcomes than their middle class white counterparts even women of color who receive the recommended prenatal care still suffer from these high rates and so we come back to the path from discrimination and it begins to paint a picture that many people of color know to be true but the longer they stay the worse their health becomes people like me born in the united states to cuban immigrant parents are actually more likely to have worse health than my grandparents did but here 's the thing this problem that racism is making people of color but especially black women and babies sick is vast i could spend all of my time with you talking about it but i because i want to make sure to tell you about one solution the solution is called the jj way she 's a midwife in the orlando florida area who has been serving pregnant women for over a decade in what she calls her and her team provide prenatal care to over six hundred women per year haitian and latina deliver at the local hospital but by providing accessible and respectful prenatal care jennie has achieved something remarkable almost all of her clients give birth her method is deceptively simple jennie says that all of her appointments start at the front desk every member of her team and every moment a a women is at her clinic is as supportive as possible the jj way is to make the finances work no matter what the hurdles no one is chastised for showing up late to their appointments no one is talked down to or belittled jennie 's waiting room feels more like your aunt 's she calls this space a classroom in disguise with the plush chairs arranged in a circle women wait for their appointments in one on one chats with a staff educator or in group prenatal classes when you finally are called back to your appointment you are greeted by alexis or trina two of jennie 's medical and moms themselves their approach is casual and friendly during one visit i observed trina chatted with a young soon to be mom while she took her blood pressure this latina mom was having trouble keeping food down due to nausea as trina deflated the blood pressure cuff she said we 'll see about changing your prescription ok we can 't have you not eating she sees her staff as part of a team that alongside the woman and her family has one goal get mom to term with a healthy baby and that her role as a provider is just to support their work trina spends a lot of her day on her cell phone texting with clients about all sorts of things one woman texted to ask if a medication she was prescribed at the hospital was ok to take while pregnant the answer was no another woman texted with pictures of an infant born under jennie 's care lastly when you finally are called back to see the provider you 've already taken your own weight in the waiting room and done your own pee test in the bathroom this is a big departure from the traditional medical so rather than a medical setting where you might be chastised for not keeping up with provider recommendations the kind of settings often available to low income women but here 's the best thing about jennie 's model remember those statistics i told you that black women are more likely to give birth too early well the jj way has almost entirely eliminated those problems starting with what jennie calls skinny babies she 's been able to get almost all her clients to term with healthy chunky babies like a baby girl born to a client of jennie 's this past june a similar demographic of women in jennie 's area who gave birth at the same hospital her clients did were three times more likely to give birth to a baby below a healthy weight some of you might be thinking all this one on one attention that the jj way requires must be too expensive to scale well you 'd be wrong and for good reason those visits are expensive and in order to maintain her model she 's got to see a lot of clients to cover costs but jennie doesn 't have to spend a ton of time with each woman if all of the members her team can provide the support information and care that her clients need the beauty of jennie 's model is that she actually believes it can be implemented in pretty much any health care setting it 's a revolution in care just waiting to happen these problems i 've been sharing with you are big they come from long histories of racism classism a society based on race and class and while we can 't eradicate racism or the stress that results from it overnight we might just be able to create environments that provide a buffer to what and during pregnancy that buffer can be an incredible tool towards shifting the impact of racism for generations to come thank you"
