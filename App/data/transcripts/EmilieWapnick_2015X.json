  "transcript": "raise your hand if you 've ever been asked the question what do you want to be when you grow up now if you had to guess how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question you can just hold up fingers raise your hand if the question what do you want to be when you grow up has ever caused you any anxiety i 'm someone who 's never been able to answer the question what do you want to be when you grow up the problem wasn 't that i didn 't have any interests it 's that i had too many in high school i liked english and math and art and i built websites and maybe you 've heard of us i began to notice this pattern in myself where i would become interested in an area and i would dive in become and then i would hit this point but eventually this sense i got this this isn 't challenging anymore but then i would become interested in something else something totally unrelated and i would dive into that and become but then i would discover something new and totally different and i would dive into that this pattern the first was that i thought that i would eventually have to pick one thing and just resign myself to being bored i worried that i was afraid of commitment or that i was scattered or that afraid of my own success if you can relate to my story and to these feelings i 'd like you to ask yourself a question that i wish i had asked myself back then ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things i 'll we are first asked the question what do you want to be when you grow up when we 're about five years old and the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you 're that age posed to little kids to elicit cute replies like i want to be an astronaut or i want to be a ballerina or i want to be a pirate insert halloween costume here and at some point what do you want to be when you grow up goes from being the cute exercise it once was while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be it though well meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like oh how cute but you can 't be a violin maker and a psychologist you have to choose and this is amy ng but most kids don 't hear about people like this all they hear but it 's more the notion of the narrowly focused life the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth and you need to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it but what if you 're someone who isn 't wired what if there are a lot of different subjects that you 're curious about and many different things you want to do and so you might feel alone you might feel like you don 't have a purpose and you might feel like there 's something wrong with you there 's nothing wrong with you what you are it 's a mouthful to say it you can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea barbara sher refers to us as scanners use whichever term you like or invent your own i have to say i find it sort of fitting that as a community we cannot agree on a but what i 've learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website here are three travel mathematics and design when they founded innovation happens at the intersections that 's where the new ideas come from and multipotentialites with all of their backgrounds are able to access a lot of these points of intersection multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning multipotentialites become interested in something we go hard we observe everything we can get our hands on we 're also used to being beginners because we 've been beginners so many times in the past and this means that we 're less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones as a child concert pianist she honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory now she 's the fastest typist she knows and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors it is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you 're drawn to even if you end up quitting you might apply that knowledge in a different field multipotentialite superpower sometimes a kickstarter consultant sometimes a teacher he 's even more valuable because he can take on various roles depending on his clients ' needs fast company magazine identified adaptability the economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive rapid learning and adaptability multipotentialites are very adept at and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus we have a vested interest in encouraging themselves and we need creative out of the box thinkers to tackle them a specialist you came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon don 't worry there 's nothing wrong with you either multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project it 's a beautiful partnership but we should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we 're are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers whatever that may be if you 're a specialist at heart then by all means specialize that is where you 'll do your best work including those of you who may have just realized in the last twelve minutes that you are one embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier more authentic life and perhaps more importantly"
