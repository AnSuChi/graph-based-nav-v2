  "transcript": "is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms bacteria viruses and fungi our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems our bodies are home to trillions of microbes and these creatures define who we are the microbes in your mouth can i get asked all of the time from people is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems and i believe the answer is yes i 'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates and i worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over three hundred rooms in this building we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building and to do this we sampled dust broke them open and compared their gene sequences this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project and things have changed and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group so at twelve o 'clock you 'll see that offices have a lot and if you were to look inside the classrooms those also have similar kind of and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland this perspective is a really powerful powerful one for designers because you can bring on principles of ecology and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable that the air flow and temperature is just right they do this using but they could also be using biology and if you compare this to the microbes in a different and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco engineers and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to another facet of how microbes get around is by people and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people or the sharing of ideas like in labs and that is exactly what we found if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another they have very similar ecosystems but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away the ecosystem is fundamentally and when i see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns it makes me think that it 's possible to tackle really challenging problems like hospital acquired infections i believe this has got to be in part a building and charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building he got really excited because it added a new dimension to what he did he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health so what i 'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building what you 're looking at is a next i 'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation a lot of buildings are operated this way probably where you work when we opened the vents up again contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers in these rooms the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well and when charlie saw this he got really excited he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane wouldn 't it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones and i think it 's possible thank you"
