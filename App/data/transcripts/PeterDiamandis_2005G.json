  "transcript": "my mission in life since i was a kid was and is to take the rest of you into space it 's during our lifetime that we 're going to take the earth and that 's exciting in fact i think it is a moral imperative that we open the space and everything we hold of value on this planet metals and minerals and real estate and energy is in infinite quantities in space in fact the earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources the analogy for me is alaska we americans bought alaska in the 1850s it 's called seward 's folly and then we discovered these things gold and oil and fishing and timber and it became you know the same thing will happen in space we are on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known it 's funded nasa 's budget up until now some images from mars the stronger stronger motivator the much stronger motivator is fear it drove us to the moon we literally in fear with the soviet union raced to the moon and we have these huge rocks you know rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there and while the probability is very small the impact figured in literally of one of these hitting the earth is so huge one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur is wealth in fact the greatest wealth if you think about these other asteroids and then actually claim that i 'm going to go out and that will fund the actual mission to go and get one but fear curiosity and greed have driven us and for me this is i 'm the short kid on the right this was my motivation was actually during apollo and apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever if you think about what happened at the turn of may twenty five jfk said we 're going to go to the and people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations to go and be part of this amazing mission and we knew nothing about going to space we went from having literally put alan shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years and the average age of the people that got us there was and that my friend this is gene cernan a good friend of mine saying if i can go to the moon this is the last human on the moon so far nothing nothing is impossible we shouldn 't be happy in standing for that we should be allowed to risk in fact anyone who says we shouldn 't because as we go forward in fact the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us industrial military complex with boeing and lockheed you know everything stored on our databases and back them up off the planet in case there would be one of those disastrous situations the difficulty is getting there and clearly the cost to orbit is key once you 're in orbit you are two thirds of the way energetically to anywhere the moon to mars and today there 's only three vehicles the u s shuttle the russian soyuz and the chinese vehicle that gets you there arguably it 's about one hundred million dollars a person we 've done two so far we 'll be announcing two more but that 's expensive and to understand what the potential is it is expensive but people are willing to pay that you know one we have a very unique period in time today for the first time ever we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration but how cheap could it get i and then you accelerate yourself to seventeen thousand five hundred miles per hour remember that one half mv squared and you figure it out it 's about five point seven gigajoules of if you expended that over if you go to one of vijay 's micro power sources and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour anybody here fast in math how much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit hundred bucks that 's the price improvement curve that we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way i 'll grant you that laughter but guys it 's that if you can imagine it you will get there eventually i have no question that the physics the engineering to get that the boeings and the lockheeds don 't spend a dollar of their own money in r & d so we need what i call an exothermic economic reaction in twelve to fifteen companies one per company that 's not it there 's only one marketplace and i call them self loading carbon payloads they 're easy to make it 's people the ansari x prize was my we offered ten million dollars in cash for the carry three people up to one hundred kilometers come back down and within two weeks make the trip again twenty six teams from seven countries spending between one to twenty five million dollars each and of course we had beautiful spaceshipone which made those two flights and won the competition and i 'd like to take you that morning for just a quick video i declare that mojave aerospace ventures has indeed earned the ansari x prize peter diamandis probably the most difficult thing that i had to do was raise the capital for this it was literally impossible we went i went to one people are going to die how can you possibly going to put this forward and raised part of the money but not the full ten million and what i ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a hole in one insurance policy see the insurance companies went to boeing and lockheed and said of ' five and i took a bet that someone would win so and the best thing is they paid off and and the check didn 't bounce laughter we 've had a lot of accomplishments and it 's been a tremendous success one of the things i 'm most happy next to the spirit of st louis and the wright flyer isn 't that great so a little bit about the future steps to space what 's available for you today you can go and experience weightless flights by ' eight suborbital flights the price tag for that you know on virgin is going to be about two hundred thousand there are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly twenty five thousand dollars for a suborbital flight orbital flights we can take you to the space station and then i truly believe once a group is in orbit around the earth i know if they don 't do it i am we 're going to stockpile some fuel make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate laughter quick moment for the designers in the audience we spent eleven years getting faa approval to do zero gravity flights here are some fun images here 's burt rutan and my good friend greg meronek inside a zero gravity and turns out 7 up has just done a little commercial that 's airing this month if we can get the audio up and let me talk about the other thing i 'm excited about the future of prizes you know prizes are a very old idea i had the pleasure of borrowing from the longitude prize and the orteig prize that put lindbergh forward and we have made a decision in the x prize foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas and we just took on a new mission statement to bring about radical breakthroughs in space and other technologies for the benefit of humanity and this is something that we 're very excited about i showed this slide to larry page who just joined our board you can get literally a fifty to one leverage on your dollars and that 's huge and then he turned around and said well if you back a prize institute that runs a ten prize you get five hundred to one i said well that 's great so we have actually are looking to turn the x prize into a world class prize institute teams start to begin you get publicity increase and when it 's won publicity shoots through the roof if it 's properly managed and that 's part of the benefits to a sponsor new technology new capability if you were going to go and try to create spaceshipone or any kind of a new technology you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome it may or may not happen but if you put up a prize the beautiful thing is you know it 's a very small maintenance fee and you pay on success innovators the entrepreneurs out there you know that when you 're going for a goal the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself so that and then you 've got to deal with the fact that you 've got government bureaucracies and institutions that don 't want you to move short circuit it must be a good idea someone 's offering ten million dollars to go and do this thing and each of these areas was something that we found the ansari x prize helped short circuit these for innovation so as an organization we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules environment nanotechnology and i 'll talk about those more and the way we 're doing that is we 're creating prize teams within the x prize we have a space prize team we craig venter has just joined our board and we 're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him we 'll be announcing later this fall about imagine being able to to sequence anybody 's dna for under one thousand dollars revolutionize medicine and clean so my final slide here is the most critical tool for solving humanity 's grand challenges it isn 't technology it isn 't money it 's only one thing it 's the committed passionate human mind"
