  "transcript": "the first patient to ever be treated with an antibiotic he was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden that small scratch became infected over the next few days his head was swollen with abscesses and and fortunately for him a small team of doctors led by a dr howard florey a drug that had been discovered twelve years before by alexander fleming if it was full of impurities that would kill the patient so second day he was doing much better and that worked day four well on the way to recovery this was but fortunately for millions of other people like this child who was treated again in the early 1940s who was again dying of a and global health has been transformed now antibiotics have been used for patients like this and they 've also been used in large quantities which means in small concentrations to make chicken and hogs grow faster just to save a few pennies on the price of meat what did that lead us to basically the massive use of antibiotics around the world has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria and i 'm sure you 've all read about this in the newspapers you 've seen this in every magazine that you come across but i really want you to appreciate the significance of this problem this is serious the next slide i 'm about to show you is of and you can see in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine this is the pattern of resistance mostly under about ten percent across the united states now watch what happens when we play the video but wherever it is it certainly is a lot worse now than it was in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance it 's a global issue affecting both rich and poor countries and maybe the pharmaceutical companies should be working harder to develop more antibiotics now it turns out that there 's something fundamental about antibiotics which makes it different from other drugs which is that if i misuse antibiotics or i use antibiotics in the same way as if i choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere that the costs i impose on others through global climate change go everywhere and i don 't necessarily take these costs into consideration and the problem of the commons is entire health systems do not consider the costs that they impose on others by the way antibiotics are actually used now that 's a problem that 's similar to another area that we all know about which is of fuel use and energy and of course energy use both depletes energy as well as leads to to local pollution and climate change and that 's analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics and we can do this in a number of ways that we 'll talk about in a second these are not separate we don 't necessarily have to make the investments in in new drug if you thought that these two were entirely fully balanced between these two options you might consider the fact that this is really a game that we 're playing gazelles have evolved to run faster because if they don 't run faster they would be lunch and the bacteria would just in the course of this little talk would have had kids and grandkids and figured out how to be resistant whereas how do we stay ahead of and once we go through all of that then we try to stay one step ahead of now this is clearly not a game that can be sustained or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead we 've got to slow the and there are ideas that we can borrow from energy which means we 're imposing the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy we might consider doing that for antibiotics perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately there are clean energy subsidies which are to switch to fuels which don 't pollute as much or perhaps don 't need fossil fuels so that could include improving hospital infection control and that could really help a third option might include something like tradeable permits consider the fact that we might not have antibiotics for many people who have infections we might consider the fact that we might want to allocate who actually gets to use some of these antibiotics and certainly consumer education works very or prescribe too much without necessarily knowing that they do so both on on energy when you tell someone that they 're using a lot of energy during peak hour they tend to cut back and the same sort of example has been performed even in the case of antibiotics a hospital in st louis basically would put up on a chart the names of surgeons in the ordering of how much antibiotics they 'd used if you take drugs that have been introduced since then the idea of paying one hundred and eighty dollars per day seems like a lot but what is that really telling us that price is telling us that we should no longer and that price is a signal to us that perhaps we need to be paying much more attention to conservation that price is also a signal that maybe we need to start looking at other technologies in the same way that gasoline prices are a signal and an impetus to say the development of electric cars prices are important signals and we need to pay attention but we also need to consider the fact that although these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics so this is going to involve a whole new paradigm shift and it 's also a scary shift because in many parts of this country in many parts of the world the idea of paying two hundred dollars for a day of antibiotic treatment is simply unimaginable so we need to think about that quorum sensing all of these are useful avenues to pursue and they will become even more lucrative we don 't want to just throw money at a problem what we want to be able to do is invest in new antibiotics in ways that actually encourage appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics and that really is going back to these technologies you all remember the line from that famous dinosaur film nature will find a way so it 's not as if these are permanent solutions we really have to remember that whatever the technology might be that nature will find some way to to work around it you might think well this is just a problem just with antibiotics and with bacteria but it turns out that we have the exact with and in some instances even those don 't work and you have xdr tb artemisinin drugs and if this were to become widespread that puts at risk the single drug that we have to treat malaria around the world in a way that 's currently safe and efficacious and if you 're from new york city i understand that the specialty there so those are also resistant now what 's common to all of these things is the idea that we 've had these technologies to control nature only for the last seventy eighty or one hundred years and we need to completely rethink how we 're going to use measures to control biological organisms and rethink how we incentivize the development introduction in the case of antibiotics the alternative is is a world in which even a blade of grass is a potentially lethal weapon thank you"
