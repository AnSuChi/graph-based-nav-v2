  "transcript": "i 've learned some of my most important life lessons from drug dealers and gang members and i 've had some of my most profound theological conversations not in the hallowed halls of a seminary but on a street corner on a friday night at one a m that 's a little unusual since i am a baptist minister it came as a part of my participation in a public safety crime reduction strategy that saw a seventy nine percent reduction in violent crime i was twenty five had my i wanted a i wanted my own clothing line you know the whole nine yards after about a year of pastoring my membership went up but seriously if you 'd have said what is your ambition i would have said just to be a good pastor to be able to be with people through all the passages of life to preach messages that would have an everyday meaning for folks and but there was something else that was happening and in most metro areas in the united states and that was the homicide rate and there were young people who were killing each other for reasons that i thought were very trivial like bumping into someone in a high school shooting the person someone with the wrong color shirt on on the wrong street corner at the wrong time and something needed to be done about that you could go to any housing project for example like the one you 'd hear it and you can go to any emergency room at any and you would see lying on gurneys and i was doing funerals but not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs and i was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that that would make some meaningful impact and so while my colleagues were building these cathedrals great and tall and buying property outside outside of the city and and moving their congregations out so that they could create or recreate their cities of god and so i stayed because somebody needed to do something and so i i even tried to be innovative in my preaching you all have heard of but the violence just careened out of control and people who were not involved in the violence were getting shot and killed somebody going to buy a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store or someone who was sitting at a bus stop just waiting for a bus oblivious to the violence on the other side of the and then something happened that changed everything for me it was a kid by the name of jesse mckie walking home with his friend rigoberto carrion they met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in in dorchester and they were killed when they caught some of the youth that had done this deed to my surprise they were around my age and so as i contemplated all of this and looked i suddenly realized that there was a paradox that was emerging inside of me and the paradox was this in all of those sermons that i preached decrying the violence i was also talking about building community but i suddenly realized that there was a certain segment of the population and so the paradox was this if i really wanted the community that i was preaching for i needed to reach out and embrace this group that i had cut out of my definition which but to reach out and to embrace those who were committing the acts of violence the gang bangers the drug dealers a law enforcement issue this is why we have the police right because i 'm the one who can 't sleep at night thinking about it because i 'm the one looking around saying somebody needs to do something about this and i 'm starting to realize that that someone is me i mean isn 't that how movements start anyway they don 't start with a a grand convention and people coming together and then walking in lockstep but it starts with just a few or maybe just one and so i decided to figure out the culture of violence in which these young people who were committing them existed and i started to volunteer at the high school after about two weeks of volunteering at the high school i realized that the youth that i was trying to reach i started to walk in the community and it didn 't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren 't out during the day going into the parks where they were building the relationship that was necessary a tragedy happened in boston that brought a number of clergy together and there was a small cadre of us who came to the realization that we had to come out of the four walls of our sanctuary and meet the youth where they were and not try to figure out how to bring them in and so we decided to walk together and we would get together in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city on a friday night and on a saturday night we weren 't but they started speaking to us after a while and what we found out is that while we were walking they were watching us and they wanted to make sure of a couple of things that number one we were going to be consistent in our behavior that we would keep coming out there and then secondly they had wanted to make sure that we weren 't out there to exploit them because there was always somebody who would say we and they would enhance and then we did an amazing thing for preachers we decided to listen and not preach come on give it p m and five a m but you do you are the subject matter experts if you will of that period of time teach us help us to see what we 're not seeing help us to understand what we 're not understanding and we got an idea of what life on the streets was all about very different very different than what is portrayed in popular media and even social media and as we were talking with them a number of myths were dispelled and one of the biggest myths was that these kids were cold and heartless what we found out was the exact opposite most of the young people who were out there on the streets are just trying to make it on and we also found out that some of the most intelligent and creative and magnificent and wise people that that we 've ever met and i know some of them call it survival but i call them overcomers because when you 're in the conditions that they 're in to be able to live every day and as a result of that we said to them how do you see this church how do you see this institution we stopped looking at them as the problem and we started looking at them as partners as assets as imagine developing a plan you have one minister at one table and a and a heroin dealer at the other table the boston miracle was about bringing people together we had law enforcement partners we had police officers but there were other cops who saw the honor in partnering with the because they realized like we did that we 'll never arrest that there will not be enough prosecutions made and you cannot fill these jails up enough in order to alleviate the problem i helped to start an organization twenty years ago a faith based organization to deal with this issue i left it about four years ago and and what i found out was that in those cities there was always this component of community leaders and came together and found ways ways to work with youth out on the streets that the solution is not to have a strong community component in the collaboration around violence reduction now there is a movement in the united states of young people who i am very proud of who are dealing with the structural issues but there is this political ploy to try to pit police brutality and police misconduct when you think about decades of failed housing policies and and poor educational structures when you think about persistent and then you throw drugs into the mix and duffel bags full of guns little wonder that and then the response that comes from the state is more cops and more suppression and one of the wonderful things that we 've been able to do is to be able to show the value of partnering together community but i need your help they need help find those people you need some help i 'll help you out find those people they 're there bring them together with because the old adage that comes from burundi is right that you do god bless you"
