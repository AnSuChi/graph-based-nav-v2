  "transcript": "there they set fire to a medieval library of thirty thousand manuscripts written in arabic and several african languages and ranging in subject from including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction unknown in the west this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent the voice of africa at a time when africa was thought not to have a voice at all called the burning of the manuscripts a crime against world cultural heritage and he was right or he would have been if it weren 't for the fact that he was also lying in fact moldering in the high humidity this time by climate and the far flung corners of the world are not the only places or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture several years ago i conducted a survey of european research libraries and discovered that at the barest minimum there are sixty thousand manuscripts pre 1500 the real number is likely double that and that doesn 't even count renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps what if there were a technology imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past history philosophy music or more provocatively that could rewrite our cultural identities building new bridges between a reader of texts into a textual scientist for me it conjures up images of passivity of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel how much better to be a participant in the past an adventurer in an undiscovered country searching for the hidden text i read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years ovid chaucer petrarch and with every scholarly article that i published i added to human knowledge in ever diminishing slivers of insight a discoverer of literature an indiana jones without the whip or actually with and so six years ago i changed the direction of my career at the time i was working on the chess of love the last important long poem of the european middle ages never to have been edited and it wasn 't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of dresden i had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and i 'd gone about as far as technology at the time and there i learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed greek mathematician a palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten and so out of the blue i decided to write professor roger easton with a plan and a plea and to my surprise he actually wrote back and with this i transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only tiny fraction of what 's actually there the same is true with invisible writing our system uses leds and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript up to thirty five images per sequence per there are about five of these in the world and once we capture these images we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them using software which was originally designed for satellite images the results can be spectacular you may already have heard of what 's been done for the dead sea scrolls here for example is a leaf from a a manuscript that we imaged which is perhaps the most valuable christian bible in the world the codex oldest translation of the gospels into latin and it dates from the first half of the fourth century this is the closest we can come to the bible at the time of the foundation of christendom under emperor constantine unfortunately has been very badly damaged it 's damaged because for centuries it had been used and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church in fact that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner is aspergillus which is a a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis our imaging has enabled me to make the first having a lab that can travel to collections where it 's needed however is only part of the solution that means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions that 's why i founded the lazarus project a not for profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever over the past five years our team of imaging scientists scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world 's most valuable damaged manuscripts included the vercelli book which is the oldest book and some of the most valuable earliest gospels located in what is now the former soviet georgia spectral imaging can recover lost texts more subtly though it can recover a a second story behind every object the story of how when and by whom a text was created and sometimes what the author was thinking at the time he wrote curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten the word perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was subjects there ladies and gentlemen is american democracy evolving under the hand of thomas jefferson or consider the one thousand four hundred and ninety one martellus map which we imaged at yale 's beinecke library this was the map that columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the new world and which gave him his idea of what asia looked like and where japan was located the detailed idea that is of what columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented the main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light ultraviolet did very little for everything in asia we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature 's entire body in africa about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke like starlight which can convey images of the way the universe looked in the distant past so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object 's creation through this the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real that make history closer to us what about the future there 's so much of the past few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever that 's why i have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that i call textual science textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar the ability to read old languages and old handwriting the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them with new techniques like chemistry of inks and pigments computer aided optical character recognition a freshman with a background in latin and greek was image processing a palimpsest and he read a line from a lost work comic dramatist menander this was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud thank you very much"
