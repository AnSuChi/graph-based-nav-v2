  "transcript": "probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to africa in the 1900s they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes and they wrote telegrams back to manchester and one of them wrote situation hopeless stop they don 't wear shoes and the other one wrote glorious opportunity they don 't have any shoes yet and rather than go into statistics and trends and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing the record companies that are folding i thought we should do an experiment tonight before we start before we start i need to do two things one is i seven year old child sounds like when he plays the piano maybe you have this child at home he sounds something like this now if he practices for a year and takes lessons he 's now eight and he sounds like this he practices for another year and takes lessons he 's nine if you 'd waited for one more year you would have heard this what happened was not maybe what you thought which is he suddenly became passionate engaged involved got a new teacher he hit he was playing with an impulse on every note can see it by looking at my head which is why i call it one buttock can be the other buttock you know a gentleman was once watching i was working with this young pianist and said the trouble with you then i got a letter from this gentleman he said i was so moved i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one buttock company now the other thing i wanted to do is to tell you about you there are one thousand six hundred people i believe my estimation is that probably forty five of you are absolutely passionate about classical music you adore classical music your fm is always on people who never listen to classical music it 's just simply not part of your life you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport tone deaf amazing number of people think they 're tone deaf actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf you couldn 't tell the difference between and the telephone she calls and says hello you not only know who it is you know what mood she 's in so nobody is tone deaf but i tell you what it doesn 't work for me to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and are passionate about classical music but even between those three categories it 's too wide a gulf so i 'm not going to go on until every single person in this room downstairs and in aspen and everybody else looking that 's what we 're going to do now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face right imagine if martin luther king had said i have a dream of course i 'm not sure they 'll be up to it all right so i 'm going to take a piece of chopin this is a beautiful prelude by chopin some of you will know it piece is long and you 've had a long day you might drift off then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say wake up it 's culture and then you feel even worse but has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you but because of us did anybody think while i was playing why is he using so many impulses if i 'd done this with my head you certainly b and it does two notes but basically it 's just a b with four sads f so we have b nobody is you know every village in bangladesh and every hamlet in china who 's expecting that e chopin didn 't want to reach the e there because what will have happened the critics sitting in the back row there they have to have an opinion so they say hamlet is a procrastinator or they say hamlet has an oedipus complex no otherwise the play would be over stupid that 's why shakespeare puts all that stuff in hamlet ophelia going mad the play within the play and yorick 's skull and the gravediggers that 's in order to delay it 's the same with the chopin he 's just about to reach the e finally he goes down to e but it 's the wrong chord because the chord he 's looking for is this one and because it deceives us i tell my students if you have a deceptive it 's the wrong chord now he tries e again turns off the key in his car and says aah so this is a piece which goes from away to home i 'm going to play it all the way through and you 're going to follow b c b c b c b down to a down to g down to f almost goes to e but otherwise the play would be over he goes back up to b he gets very excited goes to f sharp goes to e it 's the wrong chord it 's the wrong chord and it 's home and what you 're going to see is because for me to join the b to the e i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way and start thinking about the long long line you know we were just in south africa and you can 't go to south africa without thinking of mandela in jail for what was he thinking about lunch no he was thinking about the vision for south africa and for human beings this is about vision this is about the long line like the bird who flies over the field and doesn 't care about the fences e and i 've one last request before i play this piece all the way through would you think of somebody who you adore who 's no longer there a beloved grandmother a lover somebody in your life who you love with all your heart but that person is no longer with you bring that and you 'll hear everything that chopin had to say thing 12 year olds i busy people involved in all sorts of different things listening understanding and being moved by a piece is something am i sure that every single person followed that understood it was moved by it of course i can 't be sure but i 'll tell you what happened to me in ireland and i was working with some catholic and protestant kids and one of them came to me the next morning i 've never listened to classical music in my life but when you played that shopping piece but last night when you played that piece he was the one i was thinking about and i felt the tears streaming down my face and it felt really good to cry for my brother so i made up my mind at that moment if only we could move it to four percent our problems would be over laughter how would you walk how would you talk how would you be three percent of the population likes classical music if only we could move it to four percent how would you walk or talk how would you be if you thought everybody loves classical music they just haven 't found out about it yet and i suddenly had a realization the conductor of an orchestra doesn 't make a sound my picture appears on the front of the cd it was totally life changing people in my orchestra said ben what happened that 's what happened i realized my job was to you know you 're doing it you could light up a village with this guy 's eyes and this is the question who am i being we can do that with our children too who am i being that 's a totally different world now we 're all about to end this magical it 's appropriate for us to ask the question who are we being as we go back out which is that it really makes a difference what we say the words that come out of our mouth i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz one of the rare survivors she went to auschwitz when she was fifteen years old and and and she told me this she said i said ' why are you can 't you keep your things together for goodness ' sake ' the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother he did not survive and so when she came out of auschwitz she made a vow she told me this she said i walked out of auschwitz into life and the vow was i will never say anything that couldn 't stand as the last thing i ever say but it is a possibility to live into"
