  "transcript": "which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product and why not after all happiness when and how where does choice come from and who gets to express it and how do we express it one way to express choice is through the market well functioning markets provide choices and ultimately the ability to express one 's pursuit for happiness the great indian economist amartya sen was awarded the nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth ethiopia not because there was not enough food because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country but because in the north people could not access or entitle themselves to that food that was a turning point for my life most africans today by far are farmers and most of africa 's farmers are by and large small farmers in terms of land that they operate and very very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their only seven percent of arable land in africa road density is six times greater in asia than it is in rural africa there are eight times more tractors and therefore without much freedom his livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty he comes to the market when prices are lowest with the meager fruits of his hard labor just after the harvest because he has no choice she comes back to the market when prices are highest in what we call the lean season when food is scarce because she has to feed her family and has no choice the real question is how can markets be developed in rural africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship theodore schultz meaning in fact that farmers are rational and profit minded just like everybody else well we don 't need and that business is agriculture that economies must be structurally this meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling which they did rather inefficiently and let the private probably because we know that in africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next ten years where food production per capita has so why didn 't agriculture markets perform to the market reforms prompted by the west and i 've spent some fifteen years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets and have interviewed traders in ten to fifteen countries in this continent hundreds of traders trying to understand what went wrong and it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water like its agriculture africa 's markets are we know from our work around the continent that africa 's markets are weak not only because of weak such as market information grades and standards and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers because of this in narrow networks of people they know and trust and because of that as grain changes hands and i 've measured that it changes hands four five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer and really realized that that was because as traders would tell me over and over that 's the only way people know what they 're getting in terms of the quantity and that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals and situations where there are deficits for example it also has very high cost implications i have measured that twenty six percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that because of the absence of grades and standards and market information sacks have to be constantly changed and this leads to very high handling costs come to the market with virtually no information at all blind trusting that they 're going to have some sort of demand for their produce and completely at the mercy of merchants in the only market the nearest local market they know we have seen that price volatility of food crops in africa is the highest in the world there is no region of the world and no period in there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in africa today face the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as fifty percent annually this kind of market risk is implications but also direct implications for food security that because of the weak marketing system led to an eighty percent collapse in maize prices in the country and we calculated that some three hundred thousand tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early two thousand and two in july two thousand and two ethiopia announced a major food crisis fourteen million people at risk of starvation what also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by twenty seven percent this is a tragic example of arrested development but happens over and over all over africa well i 'm not here today or wring my hands i am here to tell you that change is in the air africa today is not the africa waiting for aid solutions or or cookie cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions that markets don 't happen by themselves in the 1980s it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right there was a very influential book about that which was mainly about getting governments we now recognize that getting markets right is about not just but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market when conditions are right we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural africa just like anywhere else i decided to leave my comfortable job as a world bank senior economist in washington after having spent more than a decade understanding studying and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with africa 's agricultural markets i decided it was time to do something about it i currently lead in ethiopia an exciting new initiative that concept is not new to the world in fact in one thousand eight hundred and forty eight eighty two grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the illinois river and lake michigan to establish establish a way to to trade better amongst themselves the birth of the chicago board of trade which is the most famous the chicago board of trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange in the american midwest farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it if no buyer was to be found or if prices suddenly dropped the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done from there the greatest innovation of all came about in this market which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically that meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances and the rise agricultural market superpower from where it was a small regional town now over the last century cocoa products produced mainly in the south are actually or a price discovered in these and we 're seeing a shift powered mainly because of information technology a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets and over the last decade you see that the share of western exchanges and this is similarly there 's been explosive growth where rural farmers are using exchanges growing here over the last three years by two hundred and seventy percent a year this is powered by low cost vsat technology aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market china 's dalian commodity exchange we 're in the process of designing the first organized ethiopia commodity exchange we we 're creating a system that serves all market actors that creates and enables small farmers to manage the risks that i have described the ecx edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market and this is because one of the things we 've learned over the last decade of studying market development in africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work you 've got one donor trying to develop market information another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards another ict and yet another on warehousing or warehouse receipts in our approach we 've decided to put together the entire ecosystem or environment in which trade takes place that means that the exchange will operate a trading system because we don 't think the country 's ready for full electronic so that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center what we call the remote access terminal centers and actually without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things simply see the trading that 's happening on the addis ababa trading floor at the same time what 's very fundamental to this market is that and again an innovation that we 've designed for our exchange is that the exchange will operate warehouses in house clearing system to assure that payment is done and as we 're developing the exchange market itself the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework the overarching legal framework for making this market work so in fact our proclamation is going to parliament next month what 's really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country using vsat technology to bring eight to ten kilometers away on average and sell whatever they happened to have without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market and they start to think national and even global they start to make not only commercial marketing decisions but also planting decisions on the basis of information coming from the futures price market and they come to the market knowing what grades their products it will also transform the way traders do business it will stop them from doing simple limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [ surplus regions ] to we believe that this initiative requires great political will and that we can do it ecx is the market for ethiopia 's new millennium which starts but that the returns will be even greater pan african market in in agricultural commodities ethiopia 's domestic market is about one billion dollars of if ethiopia can capture even forty percent just forty percent of the domestic market and add just twenty five percent value the value of the market doubles ethiopia 's agricultural market is is thirty percent higher than south africa 's so we feel that we have a winning value proposition thank you very much"
