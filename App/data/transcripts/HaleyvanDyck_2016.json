  "transcript": "it 's a story about a living breathing start up flourishing in an unlikely environment the united states is fundamentally beginning to disrupt the way government does business from the inside out but before i get there let 's start with the problem the problem begins with a number one hundred and thirty seven one hundred and thirty seven is the average number of days a veteran has to wait to have benefits processed by the va one hundred and thirty seven days now in order to file that application in the first place she has to navigate over one thousand different websites and over nine hundred different call in numbers all owned and operated by the united states government now we live in times of incredible change the private sector is constantly changing and improving itself all the time it 's removing every single inconvenience in my life that i could possibly think of i could be sitting on my couch in my apartment but meanwhile a working mother who depends on food stamps to support her family has to complete an arduous complicated application which she might not even be able to do online and the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means that she might be having to take days or hours off of work that she can 't spare and this growing dichotomy between the beneficiaries of the tech revolution and those it 's left behind is one of the greatest challenges of our time because government 's failure to deliver digital services that work is disproportionately impacting the very people who it 's impacting the students trying to go to college the single mothers trying to get health care the veterans coming home from battle they can 't get what they need when they need it and for these americans government is more than just a presidential election every four years why government needs to get its shit together and catch up this wasn 't always a problem i was passionate about when i joined president obama 's campaign in two thousand and eight we brought the tech industry 's best practices into politics we were a cutting edge start up that changed the game of politics i knew it wasn 't going to be easy work but i was eager and showed up ready to get to work i walked into the office and they handed me a laptop and the laptop was running windows ninety eight i mean three entire presidential elections had come and gone since the government had updated the operating system on the federal government is the largest institution in the world it spends over eighty six billion dollars a year eighty six billion on the problem here is that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for because ninety four percent for those of you keeping score yes the number ninety four is very close to one because it means as government continues to operate as it 's programmed to do failure is nearly inevitable and when the status quo is the riskiest option that means there is simply no other choice than radical disruption so what do we do about it how do we fix this so what would it look like if it was actually as easy to get student loans or veterans ' benefits as it is to order cat food to my house what would it look like enter the united states digital service the united states digital service the elderly everybody at dramatically lower for the people by the people today we don 't care thank you because it 's the only one we 've got you can think pretty funny you can think of our team a little bit like the peace corps meets darpa meets seal team six we helping restore the fabric of our democracy the first play is we recruit the very best talent our country has to offer we strategically and finally we give them massive air cover from the leadership inside the agencies all the way up to the president himself this team is beginning to disrupt how government does business from the inside out it 's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry and apply it to another where it 's a radical departure from the status quo think about what airbnb took that was normal from hospitality and revolutionized my apartment the united states digital service is doing exactly that we are taking what silicon valley and the private sector has learned through a ton of hard the good news is it 's starting to work fixing healthcare gov was the first place that we ran this play and today we are taking that same play and scaling it across a large number if i can take a moment and brag about the team for a second it is the highest concentration of badasses i could have ever dreamed of we have top talent from google facebook amazon twitter and the likes all on staff today all choosing and what 's incredible is everybody is as eager and kind as they are intelligent and i might add by the way over half of us are women applause the best way to understand this strategy is actually to walk through a couple of examples of how it 's working out in the wild i 'm going to give you two examples first one is about immigration you guessed it it 's almost entirely paper based little story about a decade ago the government thought that if it brought this system online it could save taxpayer dollars and provide a better service the typical government process began six years and one point two billion dollars later no working product was delivered one point two billion with a b now at this point the agency responsible us citizenship and immigration services and what many people don 't know is that 's the same size as the rescue effort of healthcare gov just six people and that team jumped in side by side to support the agency in transitioning this project into more modern business practices more modern development practices this is used to file for your replacement green card now for immigrant visa holders a replacement green card is a big deal your green card is your proof of identification it 's your work authorization it 's the proof that you can be here in this country it is cheaper and it 's a better user experience for the applicant and the government employees alike so as part of becoming a us citizen you have to because all of this work all of this work on immigration is about taking complicated processes and making them more human the other day one of the dedicated civil servants on the and she 's been doing this for thirty years that is exactly the kind of hope and culture change we are trying to create for my second example i want to bring it back to i 'm proud to say that just a few months ago we released a brand new beta of a new website a simple easy to use website that brings all of the online services a veteran needs into one place one website not thousands the veterans themselves this we talked to veterans themselves and we started simple and small with the two most important services that matter most to them education benefits and disability benefits and as the team continues to streamline more services they will be ported over here and the old sites shut down this is what change looks like in two thousand and sixteen when you walk out of the oval office the first time i was ever there i noticed a quote the president had embroidered on the rug 's the classic jfk quote it says no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings it 's true it 's particularly hard when we have to fight when we have to refuse to succumb to the belief that things it 's often the hardest things that are the most worth doing because if we don 't do them who will because government is not an abstract institution or a concept our government is us the question is not"
