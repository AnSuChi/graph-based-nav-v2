  "transcript": "so my name is taylor wilson i am seventeen years old and i am a nuclear physicist which may be a little hard to believe but i am and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point that the bridge that t boone pickens talked about will get us to so nuclear fusion is our energy future and the second point making the case that kids can really change the world so you may ask you may ask me well how do you know what our energy future is well i built a fusion reactor when i was fourteen years old that is the inside of well and i assembled this and it slams together deuterium which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it and i 'm slamming it together so hard that that that hydrogen fuses together and in the process it has some byproducts and i utilize those byproducts i developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that homeland security has for hundreds of dollars i 've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars i built this produce medical isotopes instead of requiring multi million dollar facilities i 've developed a device that on a very small scale can produce these isotopes so that 's my fusion reactor in the background there that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor oh by the way i make yellowcake in my garage so my nuclear program is as advanced as the iranians so maybe i don 't want to admit to that and this is me with president obama showing him my homeland security research so in about seven years of doing nuclear research i started out with a dream to make a star in a jar so thank you very much"
