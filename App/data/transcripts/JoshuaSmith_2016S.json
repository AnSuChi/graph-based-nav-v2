  "transcript": "about forty percent of us will hear those three words within our lifetime and half will not survive beyond the physical hardships roughly one third of cancer survivors here in the us will go into debt from treatment and they 're at least two and a half times more likely to declare bankruptcy than those reducing its emotional impact and minimizing financial burdens finding cancer early which is one of the primary aims of my research greatly enhances your odds of survival if we just look at the case of breast cancer for example we find that those who are diagnosed and treated at stage one have a five year survival rate of nearly one hundred percent and similar trends are found for colorectal and ovarian cancer now we 're all aware that an early diagnosis that is accurate is critical for survival often inaccurate and they can take an agonizing amount of time to get the results still worse when it comes to some forms of cancer such as good screening methods simply don 't exist meaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface which are themselves already indicators of late stage progression there is no alarm to warn for the danger is already at your doorstep when your odds of survival are greatly reduced having the convenience and accessibility of regular screening options that are affordable noninvasive and could provide results much sooner would provide us with a formidable weapon in the fight against cancer an early warning would allow us to get out ahead of the disease instead of merely following in its relentless wake and i 've been fueled last year however this fight became much more personal when my wife was it was an experience that added a strong and unexpected emotional dimension to these efforts life altering treatment can be and i 'm keenly aware of the emotional havoc that cancer can wreak on a family which in our case included our two young daughters because we found it early during a routine mammogram we were able to focus primarily on treatment options for the localized tumor reaffirming to me how important an early diagnosis is still not everyone has this done or they may develop breast cancer before the middle age recommendation for having a mammogram considerable benefits for those that don 't a key challenge then for cancer researchers is to develop methods that make regular screening for many types of cancers much more accessible imagine a scenario where during your regular checkup your doctor can take a simple noninvasive urine sample or other liquid biopsy and present you with the results before you even leave the doctor 's office such a technology could dramatically reduce the number of people who slip through the net of an early stage cancer diagnosis my research team of engineers and biochemists is working on exactly this challenge we 're working on ways to frequently activate an early stage cancer alarm by enabling regular screenings that would start when a person is healthy and before it can progress beyond its infancy little escape pods pods regularly shed by cells called exosomes exosomes they 're extremely attractive for noninvasive liquid biopsies there 's just one problem an automated system for rapidly sorting these important biomarkers is not currently available we 've created a technology that we call is capable of precisely this automated exosome isolation to aid rapid cancer diagnostics and they 're really really small they measure just thirty to one hundred and fifty nanometers in diameter this is so tiny that you could fit about a million of them into a single red blood cell once thought to be little bins for unwanted cellular waste it has been found that cells actually communicate by proteins and other genetic material collected from their cell of origin and this is where cancer comes in some bad and contain a sample of its environment they provide a genetic snapshot of that cell 's health all of these qualities make exosomes invaluable messengers that potentially allow physicians to you have to frequently intercept these messages to determine when troublemakers within your body decide to start staging a coup which is why regular screening is so critical and why we 're developing technologies to make this possible while the first exosome based diagnostics emerged on the market just this year they are not yet part of mainstream healthcare options in addition to their recent emergence another factor that 's limiting their widespread adoption is that currently no automated exists to make regular screening economically accessible ultracentrifugation a process requiring expensive laboratory equipment a trained lab tech and about thirty hours of time to process a sample we 've come up with a different approach for achieving automated exosome isolation from a sample such as urine we use a chip based continuous flow separation technique called deterministic lateral displacement we shrunk the dimensions of this technology from the micron scale to the true nanoscale so how does it work in a nutshell a set of tiny pillars separated by nanoscopic gaps are arranged in such a way that the system divides the fluid into streamlines with the larger cancer related nanoparticles being separated through a process of redirection from the smaller healthier ones which can in contrast move around the pillars in a zigzag type motion in the direction of fluid flow the net result is a complete separation of these two particle populations you can visualize this separation process similar to traffic on a highway that separates into two roads with one road going into a low clearance tunnel under a mountain and the other road going around it here smaller cars can go through the tunnel traffic is effectively separated by size and this is exactly how our system works on a much much smaller scale the idea here is that the separation process for screening which is a near term possibility within the next few it could be used to isolate and detect sensing and reporting their presence within minutes broadly speaking the ability to separate and enrich biomarkers with nanoscale precision in an automated way opens the door to better understanding diseases such as cancer with applications ranging from it was a dream of mine to facilitate the automation of this process to make regular screening more accessible similar to the way henry ford made the automobile accessible to the general population through development of the assembly line automation is the key to accessibility and in the spirit of the hoover dream a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage we 're developing a technology that could ultimately place an early warning cancer detection system in every home this would allow every man woman and child the opportunity to it is my hope and dream to help people around the world avoid the high costs physical financial and emotional faced by today 's cancer patients hardships that i 'm well acquainted with her treatment was successful and she is now thankfully is an outcome that i would like to see for everyone with a cancer diagnosis i am optimistic that within the next decade this type of technology will"
