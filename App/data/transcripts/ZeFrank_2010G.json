  "transcript": "you see all the points all the lines it 's incredible it and in my case the network has been important in media because i get to connect to people isn 't it amazing through that i connect to people and the way that i 've been doing it has been multifaceted for example i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners i put together projects like earth sandwich where i ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the earth and people started laying bread in tribute it 's pretty incredible the video 's online connecting to people in projects like youngmenowme for example the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult this is the same person top photo james bottom photo [ jennifer ] my favorite of these photos which i couldn 't find is there 's a picture of a thirty year old woman or so with a little baby on her lap and the next photo is a but this project changed the way that i thought about connecting to people this is project called ray and what happened was i was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio somebody said you have to listen to this and this is what came to me recording hi my name is ray and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt quite unfair so i was led to write this song just for her just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job and i figured i 'd put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you 're going through on your job i 'm about to whip somebody 's might not be able to sing that out loud but you can hum it to yourself and you know what the words are and let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job peace ze frank so so i was so moved by this this is incredible this was connecting this was incredible this is what i wanted to do so the first thing i thought of is we have to thank him and i asked my audience i said listen to this piece of audio we have to remix it he 's got a great voice came back lots of different attempts one stood out in particular it was done by a guy named goose it was incredible that song somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in kansas city in the end it was one of the top if you can figure out who this person is because all i had was his name ray and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset i heard you were looking for me and i was like yeah ray it 's been an interesting two weeks so i flew to st louis and met ray and he 's a preacher among other things and it 's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual but the truth is is life is being lived there when they smile right you 've seen people stop somewhere up in that weird and this is it right but ultimately what we 're trying to do is really connect with one other person and that 's not always going to happen in physical it 's also going to now happen in virtual spaces and we have to get better at figuring that out i think of the people that build all this technology in the network a lot of them aren 't very good at connecting with people this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade so here 's a series of projects over the last few years where i 've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection sometimes they 're very and take it inside of google streetview and i collected those moments the photos inside google streetview and the memories specifically our conversation started with me saying ' i 'm bored ' and her replying ' when i 'm bored i eat pretzels ' i remember this distinctly because it came up a lot i remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry i guess the shoes came off when he was hit he slept over at my house once and he left his pillow it had ' chad ' written in magic marker on it he died long after he left the pillow at my house but we never got around to returning it i was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it the way that we excise it from our bodies so what i did is i opened up a hotline a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain not necessarily related to that event and people called in and left messages like this converted them them to mp3s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails and those were then distributed to djs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material 't have time to play much of it you can look at it online and i was like what the hell does that look like so i thought well let 's just give it a try let 's have people hold up signs about reconciliation and so some really nice things came together blue i voted red together for our future these are very very cute little things right some came from the winning party dear forty eight i promise to listen to you to fight for you to respect but i doubt it as this start becoming popular a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing which i could and he said i 'm dressed as batman to hide my identity just in case i thought the real batman which actually made me feel a little better like so what i did unfortunately i was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me and it started to eat away at my psyche and i was protecting the project from it i realized i was protecting it i didn 't want this special little group of photographs to get which was an origami template but this was the emotional moment one of my viewer 's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate it 's amazing last thing i 'm going to tell you about is is a where the idea was i was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects so one of them was fairly straightforward a guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could i write a song for her his daughter and i 'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep and this was scared this is a song that i sing when i 'm scared of something the song so i wrote that song right thank you so the nice thing was is he walked by his his daughter 's room at some point and she actually was singing that song to herself so i was like awesome this is great and then i got this email and there 's a little bit of a back story to this and i don 't have much time but the idea was that at one point i did a project called facebook me equals you where i wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person so i asked for people 's usernames and i chose two people to be and i asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on facebook one person sent me a very detailed description the other person didn 't and the person who didn 't it turned out had just moved to a new city and taken on a new i so i asked her what does it feel like i started sending people this whether they had basic audio capabilities just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on so i could just get their voices back and this is the kind of thing that i got back and when you put them together something magical happens something absolutely incredible happens and all of a sudden i get a chorus from around the world and what was really great is i 'm putting all this work together in the background and laura sent me a follow up email because a good month had passed by and she said i know you 've forgotten about me want to say thanks for even considering it and then a few days later i sent her this"
