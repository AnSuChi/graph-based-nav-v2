  "transcript": "good morning given my ted profile you might be expecting that i 'm going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends the one that 's currently got wall street and the world bank buzzing how to invest in women how to empower them how to save them not me they 're saving us by redefining and re imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities polarities we 've taken for granted for a long time like the ones between modernity and tradition first world and third world in the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community there 's something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing what intrigues me most is how women are doing this despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating why is it that women are on the one hand viciously oppressed by cultural practices and yet at the same time are the preservers of cultures in most societies is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes honor religion nationality what allows is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing or are they one and the same as chimamanda adichie reminded us at the ted conference in oxford of assuming that there is a single story many and what if anything do men have to do with it much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions it 's taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people in the process i 've gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this among those who 've helped open my eyes to a third way are a devout muslim in afghanistan a group of harmonizing lesbians in croatia and a taboo breaker in liberia i 'm indebted to them as i am to my parents who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life were blessed with three daughters in this one and for reasons equally unclear to me seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us i was born and raised here in india and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all poor things you only have three daughters but you 're young you could still try again my sense of outrage about women 's rights was brought to a a flock of relatives descended on her they took off her colorful sari they made her wear a white one they wiped her bindi off her forehead they broke her bangles her daughter rani a few years older than me sat in her lap bewildered not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother late that night i heard my mother begging my father please do something ramu can 't you intervene in a low voice muttering i 'm just the youngest brother there 's nothing i can do this is that 's the night i learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world and men are affected by those rules too my father who had fought in three wars could not save his own sister from this suffering defiantly feminist on the streets chanting we are sparks of change by the time i got to beijing in i met a woman who forced me to challenge all she walked into my office at a time when no one knew she said to me it is not about the burka she was the most determined advocate for women 's rights she said the first thing anyone who is a muslim knows is that the koran requires the prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the koran she is also immensely pragmatic this headscarf and these clothes she says give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work i told him ' i 'm a believer and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive she smiles slyly he was flattered he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque and after he would leave women and girls would stay behind we began with a small literacy class to read the koran then a math class then an english class then computer classes in a few weeks everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes sakena is a teacher she shrugs when i ask her about safety look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face and i smile and i nod realizing i 'm watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity their path is their own and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different being different is something the women of lesbor in zagreb croatia know all too well to be a a homosexual in most parts of the world including right here in our country india is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice in post conflict societies like croatia where a and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast so enter a group of out dykes young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from macedonia to bosnia from serbia to slovenia in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick just queer as leah one of the founders of the group says we blend the two especially traditional songs from other parts of the former yugoslav republic after the war lots of these songs were lost but they are a part of our childhood and our history and we should not forget them improbably this lgbt singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change like alchemists turning discord into harmony their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem a bosnian love song and serbian duets leah adds with a grin kavita we especially are proud of our christmas music because it shows we are open to religious practices even though catholic church hates us lgbt but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents one father who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir now writes songs for them troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses lesbor travels through the balkans like this bosnians croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all mallika sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given the world leymah gbowee was given was a world at war she worried for their lives she dreamt she and thousands of other women among leymah 's friends was a policewoman who was muslim she promised to raise the issue with her community at the next friday sermon the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs what does it matter they said a bullet doesn 't distinguish between a muslim and a christian liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing but no for the protest they dressed all in white no makeup as leymah said we wore the white saying we were out for peace they stood on the side of the road on which charles they stood for weeks first just ten then twenty then fifty then hundreds of women wearing eventually opposing forces in liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in ghana the peace talks dragged on and on and on leymah and her sisters had had enough with their remaining funds they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building it 's called a the police are called in to physically remove the women as the senior officer approaches with a baton leymah stands up with deliberation reaches her arms up over her head and begins very slowly to untie her headdress that covers her hair you can see the policeman 's the police have disappeared in west africa if an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to the man 's family is cursed she said i don 't know if he did it because he believed but he knew we were not going to leave we were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed and the peace accord was signed and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman that 's soccer for you americans no less women like sakena and leah and leymah have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind a filipina activist once said to me how do you cook a rice cake with heat from the bottom and heat from the top the protests the marches the uncompromising position that women 's rights are human rights full stop but we also need the heat from the top and in most parts of the world that allies like the father who now writes songs for a allies like my father unlike almost every other social movement is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor it 's not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers it 's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women far too often hold ourselves and perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism that the personal is in fact the political so that as eleanor roosevelt said once of human rights the same is true of gender equality that it starts in small places close to home on the streets yes but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends and then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles women like sakena and leah and leymah but also women like sonia gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet in chile and shirin ebadi in iran are doing something else they 're challenging the very notion of western models of development they are saying we don 't have to be like you we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers we can demilitarize societies and pour resources instead into reservoirs of genuine security it is in these little stories these individual stories that i see a radical epic being written by women around the world it is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient and if my heart is singing it 's because in these little fragments every now and again you catch a glimpse of a whole of a whole new world and she is definitely on her way thank you"
