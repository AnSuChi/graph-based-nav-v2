  "transcript": "i come from lebanon i know what i have just said is simply not obvious you know lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a i don 't know why they call it civil war when there is nothing civil about it with and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable the country has been divided between politics and that 's when the marathon takes place i used to be a marathon runner long distance running was not only good for my but it helped me meditate and dream big i was hit stayed at the hospital for two years be able to walk again i realized that i was no longer the same runner i used to be i wanted to make sure so out of my the marathon was born organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident i needed something to take me out of my pain an objective to look forward to and i thought by organizing such a marathon i 'll and invite runners to come to lebanon and run under the umbrella of organizing a marathon in lebanon is definitely not like organizing one in new york how do you ask those who were once fighting and killing each other to come together and run next to each more than that how do you convince people to run a distance of twenty six point two miles at a time they were not even familiar with the word marathon i personally met with the president of the country even housewives and they shared their stories in return and that was from one human everybody wanted to be part of the marathon to show the world the true colors of lebanon and the lebanese and their desire to live in peace and harmony in october two thousand and three over six thousand runners from forty nine different nationalities and when the gunfire went off this time it was a signal to run in harmony for a change but for every disaster we had the marathon found ways to bring people together in two thousand and five our prime minister was assassinated and the country came to a complete standstill five kilometer united we run campaign over sixty thousand people came to the start line all wearing white t shirts with no political slogans that was a turning point for the marathon where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity between two thousand and six up to thousand and nine our country lebanon went through unstable years so much that our parliament resigned and no prime minister but we did have a marathon we learned that political problems can be overcome we negotiated alternative routes government protesters became sideline cheerleaders they even hosted juice stations the marathon last november different nationalities but people didn 't want to miss out on the opportunity of being part of such a national day breast cancer for the love of lebanon for peace or just simply to run the first annual and this is only the beginning raising funds for their causes stereotypes have been broken and future leaders have been created i egypt and syria have asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event we are now one of the largest running events in the middle east but most importantly it is a platform for hope and cooperation in and unstable part of the world from boston we stand as one from national marathons or from national events to smaller regional races we 've seen that people want to run peacemaking thank you"
