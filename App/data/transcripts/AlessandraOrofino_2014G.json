  "transcript": "in developing countries one third of that population is living in of global energy consumption and eighty percent of gas emissions that cause global warming like climate change the energy crisis or poverty like most of us we are not doing a very good one and that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of city life first our citizens ' willingness to engage with democratic institutions and lastly our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives when it comes to engagement voter turnout around the world peaked in the late ' 80s and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before they are just dismal in the last two years two of the world 's most consolidated almost forty percent of voters decided not to show up voter turnout was close to five percent in for a second we 're talking about democratic cities in which percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders the city of l a a city of four million people elected its mayor with just a bit over two hundred thousand votes that was the lowest turnout the city had seen in one hundred years in spite of mandatory voting almost thirty percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home you don 't need to look very far in order to find proof of that the city of rio is incredibly unequal and this is this is where over seventy thousand of the city 's poorest residents so like so many cities across the global south is a place where you can go from northern europe to sub saharan africa in the space of thirty minutes perhaps most importantly with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable could be the ideal places for human happiness to flourish we the united states population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the and the main reason is this they have seen a decline of relations of the things that make us happy many studies show an increase in solitude honesty and social and civic participation so how do we start building cities that make us care the incredible diversity of the people who live in them cities that make well i believe that if we want to change what our cities look like and we need the idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore people are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it 's time to delegate that power to someone else if the protests that swept brazil in june two thousand and thirteen have taught us anything and this needs to change because when it does not only effective and collective decision making but there is a catch obviously enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare and there 's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role unfortunately for so far most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data fallen trees or broken lamps invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them just like my mom when i was eight and she told me that i had a choice i had to be in bed by eight p m but i could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas that 's not participation and in fact governments not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters and the way we manage our natural resources those are the kinds of decisions that can actually impact global problems that manifest the good news is and i do have good news to share with you we don 't need to wait for governments to do this i have reason to believe that it 's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation three years ago i cofounded an organization called meu rio and we make it easier for people in the city of rio to organize around in these past three years meu rio grew to a network of one hundred and sixty thousand citizens of rio about forty percent of those members are young people aged twenty to amongst our members is this adorable little girl bia to your right and bia was just eleven years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition her school actually ranks among the government changed their minds bia 's school stayed in place there 's also jovita she was not alone in the last year alone two thousand and thirteen those systems have helped solve up to eighty percent and after the secretary of security got sixteen thousand emails from people asking him to do this and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases it was open to the public and he created a recycling project in the slum at the end of last year december sixteen he received an eviction order by the rio de janeiro state government the plan was to hand it over to a developer who planned to turn it into a construction site the pressure and the state government changed their minds before christmas eve the teacher and parent community at bia 's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further leandro has jovita and leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city governments around the world need to know and we are with the our cities network the meu rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities we have already started doing it in so paulo with incredible results and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives it is up to us to decide whether we want schools or parking for ourselves for our families for the people who make our lives worth living and for the incredible creativity the greatest invention of our time"
