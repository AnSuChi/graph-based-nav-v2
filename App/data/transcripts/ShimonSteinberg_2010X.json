  "transcript": "when i and then within zoology i took the course or the discipline of entomology the science of insects and then i moved to the world of plant protection plant protection from and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce so it 's a whole discipline in plant protection and biological pest control by the way or these good bugs that we are talking about they 've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years people started or people knew more and more how to exploit or how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon for their own needs because biological control phenomenon you can or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two so this phenomenon of of natural the plants and we need to know how to exploit it the biological control like a spider and a single egg on the and then you see what kind of damage it can inflict on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf in the middle a cotton leaf and on the left a tomato leaf with these little because of the sucking piercing but one two millimeters long not more than that and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces and after five minutes right hand a meal for them for twenty four hours is about five of the spider mites of the bad mites and or fifteen to twenty when temperatures rise by the way with parthenogenesis as it 's so called and they 're very happy with that apparently laughter those aphids secrete sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper parts of the plant here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned from green to black and here comes the salvation here we are not talking about a predator here we are talking a parasite not a vis vis in front of the victim at the right hand side bending its abdomen and inserting by the way the aphid tries to escape she kicks and bites and and after a few days depending upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside after a few minutes you see halfway out it takes just a few minutes and if this is a female she 'll immediately mate with and she needs to give rise to around four hundred eggs that means she has four hundred bad all these weird names i didn 't bother you with the latin names of these creatures very bad pest if you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic ornamental sweet and here comes the natural enemy minute pirate bug minute because it is rather small here you can see the adult black and two young ones and again in action this adult pierces the thrips and if we spread those for example in a sweet pepper plot so this is a very positive situation but again the question is here you saw them on a one to one basis there those natural enemies in other words what we do there amplify the natural control or the biological control phenomenon and in thirty thousand square meters of state of the art greenhouses there we are those parasitic wasps hot summer which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures and by the way it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmos genetically modified organisms whatsoever multiply and reproduce and this is the whole bunch of predatory mites you see this ampul you see this one gram is eighty thousand individuals eighty thousand individuals are good enough to control one acre four thousand square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season and we can produce from this believe you me several dozens of kilograms on an annual and no we do because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals where we employ more than one thousand hectares ten thousand dunams in israeli terms of biological pests controlling sweet pepper so the impact is very strong and there goes the question especially if you ask growers agriculturists why biological control the arava area above the great rift valley distributing so safety with respect the idea of resistance and it can happen either biological control or even natural control resistance is extremely rare this is the natural ratio and thirdly the more the public demands the aware of the fact that they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control finally i want to get to my vision or in fact to my dream this is the reality and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it 's times one hundred or something like that so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let 's say first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs that we can either secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can in israel and abroad really give nature"
