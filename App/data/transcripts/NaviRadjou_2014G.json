  "transcript": "as i did you instantly learn to get more value from limited resources and find creative ways to reuse what you already have take mansukh prajapati he has created he can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days that 's a cool invention literally in africa if you run out of your cell phone battery don 't panic you will find some resourceful let 's go to lima in peru a region with high humidity that receives only one inch of rainfall each year an engineering college in lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity the peruvians are amazing they can literally create water out of thin air for the past seven years i have met and studied and they keep amazing me the street like and basic services like healthcare and education are also scarce in those regions you have to go within yourself to tap the most abundant resource human ingenuity and use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources we call it jugaad jugaad is a hindi word that means an improvised fix a clever solution born in adversity but they create more value at lower cost for me the entrepreneurs who will create jugaad solutions are like alchemists they can magically transform adversity into opportunity and turn something of less value into something of high value in other words they mastered the art of doing more frugal innovation is the ability to create more economic and social value using fewer resources frugal innovation is not about making do it 's about making things better now i want to show you how across emerging markets entrepreneurs and companies are adopting frugal innovation on a larger scale to cost effectively deliver to billions of people who may have little income where the country 's largest i t service provider neusoft has developed a telemedicine solution this solution is medical devices that less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics china desperately needs these frugal medical solutions because by two thousand and fifty it will be home to over half a billion senior citizens now let 's go to kenya a country where half the population a mobile payment solution this is a great solution for the african continent but what is exciting is that m pesa is now becoming the source of other disruptive business models in sectors like energy take m kopa the home solar solution that comes literally in a box that has a solar rooftop panel three led lights which is too expensive for most kenyans and this is where mobile telephony can make the solution more affordable today you can buy this kit by making an initial deposit of just and then pay off the rest by making a daily micro payment of forty five cents using your mobile phone once you 've made three hundred this shows that which is energy instead of building frugal innovation is diametrically opposed where we keep chasing the next big technology thing and use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products and they charge customers more money for new features so the conventional business model in the west is more for more this more for more model is running out of gas for three reasons first a big portion of customers in the west second we are running out of natural water and oil in california where i live water scarcity is becoming a big problem and third most importantly because of the growing income disparity between the rich and the middle class in the west there is a big disconnect between existing products and services and basic needs of customers there are over seventy million americans today who are underbanked because existing banking services are not designed to address their basic needs the prolonged economic crisis in the west is making people think i believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the west is if we learn to do more with less the good news is several western companies are now adopting frugal innovation let me give you two examples actually it 's a small manufacturing plant set up by grameen danone this factory is ten percent the size of existing danone factories and cost much less to build now this factory unlike western factories that are highly relies a lot on manual processes in order to generate jobs for local communities danone was so inspired by this model that combines now when you see this example you might be thinking well frugal innovation is low tech actually no frugal innovation is also about making high tech more affordable and more accessible to more people let me give you an example but it 's also great for patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by thirty percent and radiation dosage by up to sixty percent where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality but the frugal innovation revolution it 's called gthrive they make these wireless sensors designed like plastic rulers that farmers can this dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy which is a great solution for california which faces major water shortage second example is no bandwidth areas where there 's no wi fi or 3g or 4g how do they do that but that happens to be the most reliable and most widely available around the world three billion people with cell phones can 't access the internet this solution can connect them to the internet in a frugal way there is a startup calle compte nickel which is revolutionizing the banking sector it allows thousands of people to walk into a mom and pop store and in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products an international bank account number and an international debit card they charge a flat annual maintenance fee of just twenty euros that means you can do all banking transactions send and receive money pay with your debit card all with no additional charge this is what i call low cost banking without the bank amazingly percent of the customers using this service are the middle class french who can 't afford high banking fees initially pioneered in the south now being adopted in the north ultimately we when i first saw them i the engineers at the ibm lab in kenya unlike in the west megaffic doesn 't rely on roadside sensors which are very expensive to install in nairobi collected from a small number of and they can sms drivers alternate routes to take granted megaffic is not as sexy as ucla health launched its global lab for innovation which seeks to identify frugal healthcare solutions anywhere in the world that will be at least twenty percent cheaper than existing and yet more effective i gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world but the question is how do you go about adopting frugal innovation well i gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world that i want to share with you that you can apply in your own organization the first principle is keep it simple try to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available like using mobile telephony to offer clean energy or mom and pop stores to offer banking services but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units like grameen bank has shown the north is now learning to do more and better with less as it faces resource french national who lives in the united states my hope is that we transcend this artificial divide so that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world thank you very much"
