  "transcript": "age two which was to wait until late in the evening when my parents were decompressing from a hard day 's work jump up on the couch rip the cushions off throw them on the floor scream at the top of my lungs and run out because i was the incredible hulk and this routine went on for some time when i was seven i went to summer camp my parents found it necessary for peace of mind and at noon each day the campers would go to a pond where they had floating docks you could jump off the end into the deep end i was born premature i was always very small my left lung had collapsed when i was born and i 've always had buoyancy problems so water was something that scared me to begin with but i would go in on occasion and on one particular day the campers were jumping through inner tubes they were diving through inner tubes and i thought this would be great fun a camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us from that point onward i was terrified that is something that i did not get over my inability to swim has been one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments but there is a happy ending to this story at age thirty one that 's my age now of the obvious aspects of swimming and went from swimming one lap so twenty yards like a drowning monkey at about two hundred beats per minute heart rate i measured it to going getting out and feeling better than when i went in and i came out in feeling like the incredible hulk and that 's what i want everyone in here to feel like the incredible hulk at the end of this presentation more specifically i want you to feel like you 're capable of and i would like to share my art if i have an art it 's deconstructing things that really scare the living hell out of me so moving onward swimming and the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said i will go a year without any stimulants this is a type of guy if you can complete a one kilometer open the clock started ticking i started seeking out triathletes because i found that lifelong swimmers often couldn 't teach what they did i tried kickboards my feet would slice through the water like razors i wouldn 't even move i would leave demoralized staring at my feet and then chris sacca who is now a dear friend mine had completed an iron man with one hundred and three degree temperature said i have the answer to your prayers and he introduced me to the work of a man named terry laughlin who is the founder of total immersion swimming or not good at it the first is forget about kicking very counterintuitive so it turns out that propulsion isn 't really the problem kicking harder doesn 't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion so what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body much like a small car behind a big car on the highway and you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water the body is so you end up number three not swimming in the case of freestyle but actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible this is terry and you can see that he 's extending his right arm below his head and far in front and so his entire body really is underwater the arm is extended below the head the head is held in line with the spine so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up very important especially for people with lower body fat you can see this is the left extension and the only purpose of that is to rotate his hips so he can get to the and then propelling himself incorrect above which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you not their 'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did which is going from twenty one strokes per 20 yard length to eleven strokes i can 't wait to go swimming i 'll be doing a swimming lesson later for myself easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll and just to look at your recovery hand and that will get you very far material versus method i like many people came to the conclusion that i was terrible at languages and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much donde esta el bano and i wouldn 't even catch the response a sad state of affairs most of my friends were taking japanese so i thought why not punish myself i 'll do japanese six months later i had the chance to go to japan have japanese language classes every day to help you cope it will be an amazing experience my first overseas experience in fact i left i arrived in tokyo amazing i couldn 't believe i was on the other side of the world i before my first day of you 've never seen a more confused japanese woman laughter it could have and he goes and that 's that 's pretty much my response and that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method i tried everything i went to kinokuniya i tried every nothing worked until i found this or a poster of the one thousand nine hundred and forty five common use characters as determined by the ministry of education in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one many of the publications in japan limit themselves to these characters to facilitate literacy some are required to and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone as soon as i focused on this material i took off asahi newspaper about six months later so a total of eleven months later and went from japanese i to japanese vi ended up doing translation work at age sixteen when i returned to the u s and speak read and write five or six this brings us to the point which is it 's oftentimes what you do not how you do it that is the determining factor this is the difference between being effective doing the right things and being efficient doing things well whether or not they 're important you can also do this with grammar i came up with these six sentences after much experimentation having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar you can then if you want to acquire you 'd be wrong because my body is very poorly designed for most things pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps i used to be much bigger much more muscular and so i ended up walking like this i looked a lot like an like an or the incredible hulk not very good for ballroom dancing i found myself in argentina in two thousand and five decided to watch a tango class had no intention of participating usually a good ratio the instructor says you are participating death sweat fight or flight fear sweat because i tried ballroom dancing in college stepped on the girl 's foot with my heel she screamed i was so concerned with her perception of what i was doing that it exploded in my face never to return to the she comes up and this was her approach the teacher okay come on grab me gorgeous assistant instructor and she pulled back threw down her arms put them on her hips turned around and yelled across the room this guy is built like mountain of muscle and he 's grabbing me like a fucking frenchman which i found encouraging everyone burst into laughter i was humiliated she came back she goes come on i don 't have all day as someone who wrestled since age eight i proceeded to crush her and she looked up and said now that 's better so i bought a month 's worth of classes to look at i wanted to set competition so i 'd have a deadline parkinson 's law the perceived complexity complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it so i had a very short deadline for a competition i got a female instructor first so i wouldn 't have a repeat of college and then i took an inventory along with her of i interviewed these people because they all taught expertise they recommended certain training methods then there were implicit commonalities that none of them seemed to be practicing so i decided to focus on three of those commonalities long steps so a lot of milongueros the tango dancers will use very short steps i found that longer steps were much more elegant so you can have secondly different types of pivots tempo these seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete if i wanted to comptete against people who 'd been practicing for twenty to thirty years that photo semi finals of the buenos aires championships four months later then one month later went to the world championships made it to the semi final and then set a world record following that two weeks later i want you to see part of what i practiced i 'm going to jump forward here this is the instructor that alicia and i chose for the male lead and his tempo changes and his pivots alicia in her so i think you 'll agree they look quite good together now what i like about this video the strength in my feet to do that so he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm so he can lift the woman to break her for example that 's just one benefit of that so then we broke it down this would be an example of one pivot this is a back there are many different types i have hundreds of hours of footage all categorized much like george carlin categorized his comedy take the analytical"
