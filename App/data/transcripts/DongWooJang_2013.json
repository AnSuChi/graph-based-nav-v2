  "transcript": "it is said that the grass is always greener and i believe especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success well i can tell you that in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the korean school system also known as pressure cooker not everyone can do well while many people responded in different ways about our education system my response high pressure environment why bows i perhaps in the face of constant pressure if you think about it bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times the area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the joseon dynasty where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves in order to raise the historical awareness of this fact the government has planted mulberry trees the seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight olympics which nobody bothers to pay attention to had been left free from major intervention and this is where i first found my treasures i wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that i sneaked sickles and axes and i did not bring the tools here to long beach security i and polish wood all night long i was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place the rooftop of my apartment building a place where ninety six families call home a customer from a department store across from my building called nine hundred and eleven i was really and i will be more careful with open fire from now on i also researched extensively on bows around the world in that yew and mulberry and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that i mentioned before the most effective bow for me would be like this when you draw and shoot the arrow two belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight which means more power sinew used in the outer layer of the limb horn used to store energy in compression mending bending and amending and when it was finally done i was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own and see how my bow resembles them thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me but never bothered to look close and near i began to take which had never inspired me before in the end the grass and but in order to make a good bow a great amount of sensitivity is required each fiber in the wood i may be an [ odd ] student with i hope i am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind where everyone is needed exactly where they are like the fibers and the tendons in a bow a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is i am shooting a part of myself to you thank you"
