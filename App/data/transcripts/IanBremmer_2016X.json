  "transcript": "everyone 's talking about driverless cars these days and i love the concept of a driverless car but when i go in one i want access to the steering wheel and the brake just in case i don 't know about you but i am not ready for a driverless bus i am not ready for a driverless airplane how about a driverless world and i ask you that because we are increasingly in one it 's not supposed to be that way we 're number one the united states is large and in charge americanization and globalization for the last several generations have basically been the same thing right whether it 's the world trade organization the bretton woods accord on currency our friends our allies our money our standards so it 's sort of interesting if you want to look at how the us looks here it is this is our view of how the world is run i don 't know how many of you saw the china trip last week and the g20 oh my god right this is how we landed for the most important meeting of the world 's leaders in china the national security advisor was actually spewing expletives on the tarmac kind of left out the bottom of the plane along with all the media and everybody else later on in the g20 well there 's obama they look like they 're about to get into a cage match right and they did it was ninety minutes long they talked about syria that 's what putin wanted to talk about he 's increasingly calling the shots he 's the one willing to do stuff there but it 's not as if the americans are telling him what to do how about when the whole twenty are getting together surely when the leaders are all onstage then the americans are pulling their weight uh oh angela merkel has she always does that look she always does that but putin is telling turkish president erdogan what to do and obama is like what 's going on over there you see and the problem is it 's not a g20 the problem is it 's a g zero world that we live in a world order where there is no single country or alliance that can meet the challenges of global leadership the g20 doesn 't work the but americanization is not so if i 've convinced you of that i want to do two things with the rest of this talk i want to talk about the implications of that for the whole world i 'll go around it and then i want to talk about what we think right here so why what are the implications why are we here well we 're here because we spent two trillion dollars on wars in iraq and afghanistan that were failed we don 't want to do that anymore and we have an energy revolution where we don 't need opec or the middle east the way we used to we produce all that right here in the united states so the americans don 't want to be the global sheriff for security or the architect of global trade the americans don 't want to even be the cheerleader of global values well then you look to europe but it is now weaker than it has been at any point since world war ii all of the crises the hedging going on between the french and the russians or the germans and the turks or the brits and the chinese in competition with that of the us the russians want to do more leadership you see that in ukraine in the baltic states in the middle east let 's start easy with the middle east i left a little out but you get the general idea look one is because there was a willingness to provide some level of military security by the us and allies number two it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground because oil was expensive and number three was no matter how bad the leaders were the populations were relatively quiescent i can tell you in a g zero world all three of those things are increasingly not terrorism refugees and the rest does the entire middle east fall apart no israel iran over time but generally speaking it 's not a good look ok how about this guy there 's no question he 's hitting above his weight but long term long term if you think that the russians were antagonized by the us and europe expanding nato right up to their borders when we said they weren 't going to and the eu encroaching them just wait until the chinese put hundreds of billions of dollars in every country around russia they thought they had influence in the chinese are going to dominate it the russians are picking up the crumbs in a g zero world this is going to be a very tense ten years for mr it 's not all bad asia actually looks a lot better there are real leaders across asia they have a lot of political stability they 're there for a while mr modi in india mr abe who is probably about to get a third term written in in the liberal democratic party in japan of course xi jinping who is consolidating enormous power the most powerful leader in china since mao we see that kim jong un just in the last couple of days tested yet another nuclear weapon but the leaders in asia do not feel the need to wave the flag to let 's turn to europe europe does look a little scared in this environment so much of what is happening in the middle east is washing up quite literally onto european shores you see see the concerns of populism across let me tell you that over the long term in a g zero world european expansion will be seen to have gone too far europe went right up to russia went right down to the middle east and if the world were truly becoming more flat and more americanized that would be less of a problem but world those countries nearest russia and nearest the middle east actually have different economic capabilities different social stability and different political preferences and systems than core europe so europe was able to truly expand under the but under the g zero europe will get smaller core europe around germany and france and but the periphery countries like greece and turkey and others will not look that good at all latin america a lot of populism made the economies not go so well they had been more opposed to the united states we will see it in venezuela when maduro falls we will see it in brazil after the after the impeachment and when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there the only place you see that that is moving in another direction is the unpopularity of mexican president pea nieto there you could actually see a slip away from the united states over the coming years the us election matters a lot on that one too a lot of people have said it 's going to be africa 's decade finally in a g zero world it is absolutely an amazing time for a few african countries those governed well with a lot of urbanization a lot of smart people women really getting into the workforce entrepreneurship taking off but for most of the countries in africa it 's going to be a lot more dicey extreme climate conditions radicalism both from islam and also christianity very poor governance borders you can 't defend lots of forced migration those countries can fall off the map so you 're really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the but in the united states my god after fifteen months of campaigning we should be upset i understand that but a lot of people are upset because they say washington 's broken we don 't trust the establishment we hate the media heck even globalists like me look i do think that when you are being chased by the bear you need to only outrun your fellow campers we look ok a let 's go new york real estate let 's send our kids to american universities you know our neighbors are awesome canada mexico and two big bodies these are factors of large magnitude we just accepted ten thousand syrian refugees and we 're complaining bitterly about it you know why because they can 't swim here i mean the turks would love to have only ten thousand syrian refugees the jordanians that 's the reality of the united states now that sounds pretty good here 's the challenge in a g zero world the way you lead is by example if we know we don 't want to be the global cop anymore if we know we 're not going to be the architect of global trade we 're not going to be the cheerleader of global values we 're not going to do it the way we used we need to lead by example be so compelling that all these other people are going to still say it 's not just they 're faster campers the election process this year is not proving a good option hillary clinton says it 's going to be like the ' 90s we can still be that cheerleader on values we can still be the architect of global trade we can still be the global sheriff and donald trump wants to bring us back to the ' 30s he 's saying our way or the highway you don 't like it lump it are recognizing a fundamental truth of the g zero which is that even though the us is not in decline it is getting objectively harder for the americans to impose their will even have great influence on the global order are we prepared to truly lead by example what would we have to do to fix this after november after the next president comes in either we have to have another crisis that forces us to respond we need to see that the hollowing out are themselves urgent enough to force our leaders to change and that we have those voices thank you very very much"
