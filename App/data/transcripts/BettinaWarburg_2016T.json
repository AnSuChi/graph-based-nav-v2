  "transcript": "economists have been exploring people 's behavior for hundreds of years how we make decisions how we act individually and in groups how we exchange value now that 's a pretty bold statement but if you take nothing else away from this talk i actually want you to remember that while blockchain it 's also a continuation of a very human story and the story is this as humans we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value now one of the first people to really explore the idea of institutions as a tool in economics to lower our uncertainties about one another and be able to do trade was the nobel economist douglass north he passed away at the end of two thousand and fifteen but north pioneered what 's called new institutional economics and informal constraints like bribery and we can see this play out over the course of human history but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions these institutions helped us manage our trade as the uncertainty and the complexity grew ebay alibaba just faster institutions that act as middlemen to facilitate human economic activity as douglass north saw it institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange and i believe we are now entering a further and radical evolution of how we interact and trade we can lower uncertainty not just with political and economic institutions like our banks our corporations but we can do it with technology alone it 's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what the transactions are secured through cryptography and over time that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured this creates an immutable unforgeable record it 's not an app it 's not a company it 's a composite view that 's constantly changing and being updated and they 're just a data infrastructure on wikipedia it 's an open platform that stores words and images and the changes to that data over time ownership and location for assets like the digital currency bitcoin other even personal identifiable information but at its core that 's how it works it 's this public registry that stores transactions in a network which brings me to my point blockchains lower uncertainty so uncertainty is kind of a big term we face uncertainties like not knowing who we 're dealing with say i want to buy a the first thing i 'm going to do is look up who i 'm buying from are they a power user do they have great reviews and ratings or do they have no profile at all reviews ratings checkmarks these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we 're dealing but the problem is they 're very fragmented think about how many profiles you have allow for us to create an open global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source this allows us to create a portable identity more than a profile it means you can selectively reveal the different attributes about you that help facilitate trade or interaction for instance that a government issued you an id or that you 're over twenty one by revealing the cryptographic proof that these details exist and are signed off on having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and blockchains could lower uncertainty in who we 're dealing with say you 're going to send me that smartphone by mail i want some degree of transparency i want to know that the product i bought luxury goods any kind of data or product that we don 't want tampered with the problem in especially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone is they 're managing all of these different vendors across a horizontal supply chain and so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time we can create a shared reality across by this i mean all of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other or trust each other because they each have the ability to monitor and validate the chain for themselves it has one single truth we can create that using blockchains we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly so all of these vendors all sorts of companies can interact using the same database without trusting one another it means for adding value as it goes so i 've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity and how they change what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades like in a supply chain the last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open ended and it 's reneging what if you don 't send me the smartphone can i get my money back blockchains allow us to write code binding contracts between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party so if we look at the smartphone example you could think about escrow but you don 't need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met you got the phone blockchains lower our it means a lot of human economic activity can get i think what would probably floor douglass north about this use of technology is the fact that the very thing that makes it work the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified so rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks our governments our corporations we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open even though the media has said that it 's going it 's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem and potentially save the rainforest the truth is this technology is in its infancy but there are tons of people working on this from financial institutions to technology companies start ups and universities and one of the reasons is that it 's not just an economic it 's also an innovation in computer science blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange of exchange of currency of but it does this in a because we are about to face a world thank you i think i understood that and it 's complex what is your estimate for estimate for the rate of adoption bettina warburg my lab is pretty much focused on going the enterprise and government route first so i think we 're sort of facing the same john sculley idea of technology should either be invisible or beautiful and blockchain is kind of neither of those things right now so it 's better suited for either really early adopters who kind of get it and can tinker around around or for finding those best use cases like identity or asset tracking or smart contracts that can be used at that level of an enterprise or government"
