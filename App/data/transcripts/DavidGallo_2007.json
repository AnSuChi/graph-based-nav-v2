  "transcript": "and anyone that 's had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down it 's a perfectly positively pitch black world and we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn 't describe these blinking lights a world of bioluminescence like fireflies dr edith widder she 's now at the ocean research and conservation association was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals and that 's what you 're seeing here on the screen there 's a flying turkey under a tree i 'm a geologist by training but i love that and a lot of what goes on inside there 's a fish with glowing eyes pulsating eyes and then this last one one of my favorites this pinwheel design just absolutely amazing every single dive that 's the unknown world and today we 've only explored about three percent three percent of what 's out there in the ocean underwater lakes underwater waterfalls a lot of that we shared with you from the stage and in a place where we thought no life at all we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tells us that we don 't know much about this planet at all there 's still but i want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing cephalopods head foots as a kid i knew them as calamari mostly this is an octopus this is the work of dr roger hanlon at the marine biological lab and it 's just sense their surroundings look at light look at patterns here 's an octopus moving across the reef tough thing to do they do it by bouncing their butts together which is an interesting here 's a male on the left and a female on the right and the male has managed to split his coloration coloration so the female only always sees the kinder gentler squid in him brown on the left he takes a step back he 's keeping off the other males by splitting his body and comes up on the other side bingo not just a squid phenomenon with males but i don 't know this is a giant australian cuttlefish and there he is his droopy little eyes up here but they can do pretty amazing things too here we 're going to see one backing into and watch his watch his tentacles he just pulls them in makes them look just like algae disappears right into the background positively amazing here 's two males fighting once again they 're smart enough these cephalopods they know not to hurt each other but look at the patterns that they can do with their skin that 's an amazing thing this guy can make himself look like a rock and looking at his environment can actually slide across the bottom using the waves and the shadows so he can 't be seen his motion blends right into the background the moving rock trick so we 're learning lots new from the shallow water still exploring the deep but learning lots from the shallow water there 's a good reason why the shallow water 's full of predators and if you 're an octopus or a cephalopod you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide and you see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn 't use your camouflage use your skin to change color and texture here 's some algae in the foreground and an octopus ain 't that amazing now roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink and when he lands the octopus says seen the best thing to do is to get as big as i can get that big brown makes his eyespot very big so he 's bluffing let 's do it backwards i thought he was joking when he first showed it to me i thought it was all graphics so here here it is in reverse watch the skin color watch the skin texture just an amazing animal it can change color and texture to match the surroundings watch him blend right now he 's gone and so am i thank you very much"
