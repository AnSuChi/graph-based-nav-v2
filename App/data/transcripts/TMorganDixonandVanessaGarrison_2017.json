  "transcript": "let the words of my the meditation of our hearts be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my strength and my redeemer vg we call the names and rituals of our ancestors into this room today because from them we received a powerful blueprint for survival strategies and tactics for healing carried across oceans by african women passed down to generations of black women in america who used those skills to navigate institutions of slavery and we walk in the footsteps of those women our foremothers legends like ella baker septima clark fannie lou hamer from whom we learned the power of organizing after she would had single handedly registered sixty thousand voters in jim crow mississippi tmd of people so if you can imagine but today one hundred thousand black women and girls stand on this stage with us we are committed to healing ourselves to lacing up our sneakers to walking out of our front door every single day for total healing and transformation in our communities because we understand and so we 've had a lot of moments great moments including the time we had on our pajamas we were working on our computer and michelle obama emailed us and invited us to the white house and we thought it was spam it is an opportunity that we don 't take for granted or would we talk to you we decided to talk to you and to talk to you about a question that we get all the time it is why are black women dying faster and at higher rates than any other group of people in america from preventable obesity related diseases the question hurts me i 'm shaking a little bit but we 're going to talk about it and invite you into an inside conversation today because it is necessary and because we need you each night before the first day of school my grandmother would sit me next to the stove and with expert precision use a hot comb to press my hair loud she filled up a room with laughter and oftentimes curse words she cooked a mean peach cobbler had eleven children a house full of grandchildren and like every black woman i know like most all women i know she had prioritized the care of others over caring for herself dead at years old from a heart attack by the time i would graduate college i would lose two more staring back at me the number i knew i could not sit by and watch another woman i loved die an early death tmd so we don 't usually put our business in the streets but i have to tell you the statistics and i remember a statistic that half of black girls will get diabetes unless diet and levels of activity change half of the girls in my classroom so i couldn 't teach anymore so what we thought is if we could rally a million of their mothers eighty two percent of black women are over a healthy weight right now but the number that i cannot that i cannot get out of my head is that every single day in america one hundred and thirty seven black women die from a preventable disease heart disease that 's every eleven minutes one hundred and thirty seven is more than gun violence cigarette smoking and hiv combined every day it is roughly the amount of people that were on my plane from new jersey to vancouver can you imagine that a plane filled with black women crashing to the ground every day and no one is talking about it vg so the question that you 're all asking yourselves right now is why why are black women dying we asked ourselves that same question why is what 's out there not working for them private weight loss companies government interventions public health campaigns i 'm going to tell you why because they focus on weight loss or looking good in skinny jeans without acknowledging the trauma that black women hold in our bellies and bones that has been embedded in our very the best advice from hospitals and doctors the best medications from pharmaceutical companies to treat the congestive heart failure of my grandmother didn 't work because they didn 't acknowledge the systemic racism that she had dealt with since birth mass incarceration putting more black bodies behind girltrek does for black women whose bodies are buckling under the weight of systems never designed to support them imagine the grief that overcomes your body in that moment the immobilizing fear now know this that just days after laying her son to rest danita kimball posted online i don 't know what to do or how but my sisters keep telling me i need to walk so i will and then just days after that i got my steps in today for my baby norm it felt good to be out there to walk tmd walking through pain is what we have always done my mom she 's in the middle right there my mom and her mom stepped onto indian territory fleeing the terrors of the jim crow south and her mom walked her man to the door as he went off to fight in the kentucky colored regiment the civil war they were born slaves but they wouldn 't die slaves change making it 's in my blood it 's what i do and this health crisis ain 't nothing compared to the road road we have traveled so it 's like james cleveland i don 't feel no ways tired so we got to work we started looking at models of change we looked all over the world we needed something not only that was a part of our cultural inheritance like walking but something that was something that we could replicate across this country so we studied models like wangari maathai who won the nobel peace prize for inspiring women to plant fifty million trees in kenya she brought kenya and we looked at walking scientifically and what we learned is that walking just thirty minutes a day can and dementia we know that walking is the single most powerful thing that a woman can do for her health so we knew we were on to something because from harriet tubman to the women in montgomery when black women walk things change we used the best practices of the civil rights movement we huddled up in church basements we did grapevine information sharing through beauty salons we empowered and trained mothers to stand on the front lines we took our message directly to the streets and women responded women like lakeisha in chattanooga chrysantha in detroit every day and commit to walking as a practice of self care once walking those women get to organizing first their families then their communities to walk and talk and solve problems together they walk and notice the abandoned building they walk and notice the lack of sidewalks the lack of green space and they say no more women like susie paige in philadelphia who after walking daily past an abandoned building in her neighborhood let me rally my team let me grab some supplies let me do what no one else has done for me and my community and trust me i love harriet tubman i 'm obsessed with her so i used to have an old saab the kind of canvas top that drips on your head when it rains and i drove all the way down to the eastern and when i stepped on the dirt that harriet tubman made her first escape i knew she was a woman just like we are and that we could do what she had done and we learned four things from harriet tubman the first one do not wait walk right now in the direction of your healthiest most fulfilled life because is a revolutionary act number two when you learn the way forward come back and get a sister so in our case start a team with your friends your friends your family your church number three rally your allies every single person in this room the most underreported fact of harriet tubman is that she lived to be and she didn 't live just an ordinary life uh uh she was standing up for the good guys she married a younger man she adopted a child i 'm not kidding she lived and i drove up to her house of freedom in upstate new york and she had planted apple trees and when i was there on a sunday they were blooming do you call it do they bloom the apples were in season and i was thinking she left fruit for us and we know that there is a harriet in every community in america vg we also know that there 's a harriet in every community across the globe and that they could learn from our tubman doctrine as we call it the four steps imagine the possibilities beyond the neighborhoods of oakland and newark to the women working rice fields in vietnam tea fields in sri lanka the women on the mountainsides in guatemala the indigenous reservations throughout the we believe that women walking and talking together to solve their problems is a global solution tmd and i 'll and so i i blew her a kiss because it was sybrina fulton trayvon martin 's mom and she whispered thank you back to me and i can 't help but wonder what would happen if there were groups of women walking on trayvon 's block that day or what would happen in the south side of chicago every day if there were groups of women and mothers and aunts and cousins walking or along the polluted rivers of flint michigan because it 's already starting to vg we believe that the personal is political our walking is for healing for joy for fresh air quiet time to connect and disconnect and it is our call to action to every black woman listening every black woman in earshot of our voice every black woman who you know think about it the woman working front desk reception at your job the woman who delivers your mail your neighbor lines for change in your community tmd and i 'll bring us back to this moment and why it 's so important for my dear dear friend vanessa and i it 's because it 's not always easy for us and in fact we have both seen really really dark days from the hate speech to the summer of police brutality and violence that we saw last year sandy bland who died in police custody but the most courageous thing we do every day is we practice faith that goes beyond the facts and we put feet to our prayers every and make jazz that took sit ins and marches and made us jump boundaries and barriers you 've got to find it and pass it on we thank you so much for this opportunity"
