  "transcript": "and your brain can be broken into two parts and for so where would you put your brain on this scale it 's not like they 're mutually and so i consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists who but at the same time we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work and then we develop from there and really you do the same thing so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time i mean it can sound weird to think about but you weren 't born with this notion you developed it and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop unless you 're a particle physicist it 'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don 't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles and so that 's where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny but you didn 't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us and maybe it 's just because i don 't play with particles very often nobody 's ever seen a particle but it didn 't sit well with my logical side either because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics then shouldn 't everything just follow quantum mechanics i don 't see any reason why it shouldn 't so a few years ago i set off to do just that so i made one this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition and that 's this piece of metal i 'm going to be talking about in a minute this is a photograph of of the object and here i 'll zoom in a little bit we 're looking right there in the center and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip i went into a clean room with and then i just cranked away at all the big machines for about one hundred hours for the last stuff i had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device needs a little help to do it here let me give you an analogy you i mean when i 'm in an elevator all alone i do all sorts of weird things but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because so quantum mechanics quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way the fellow passengers for and so that 's what we did and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero instead of just sitting perfectly still it was vibrating and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and contracting bellows and by giving it a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time so what i 'm telling you here is something truly fantastic so let 's think about the atoms so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down now it 's only at precise times they align the rest of the time they 're delocalized which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places i think this is really cool really it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because check this out the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you that chunk of metal can be in two different places then why not you i mean so imagine if you 're in what would that be like how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space there 's one more part to the story it 's when we warmed it up and and so i had to develop this new intuition that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected well that 's not quite right it 's more than that literally define who you are thank you"
