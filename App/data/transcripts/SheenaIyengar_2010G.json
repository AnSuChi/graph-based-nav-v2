  "transcript": "i 'm going to take you around the world in eighteen minutes my base of operations in kyoto japan where i was living with a japanese family while i was doing part of my dissertational research fifteen years ago i knew even then that i would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings but they popped up when i least expected it on my first day i went to a restaurant and i ordered a cup of green tea with sugar after a pause the waiter said one does not put sugar in green tea i know i said i 'm aware of this custom but i really like my tea sweet in response he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation one does not put sugar in green tea i understand i said that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea but i 'd like to put some sugar in my green tea surprised by my insistence the waiter took up the issue with the manager pretty soon a lengthy discussion ensued and finally the manager came over to me and said i am very sorry we do not have sugar since i couldn 't have my tea the way i wanted it i ordered a cup of coffee which the waiter brought brought over promptly resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar my failure to procure myself a cup of sweet green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding from my american perspective when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences she has every right to have that request met the american way to quote burger king is to have it your way because as starbucks says happiness is in your choices but from the japanese perspective it 's their duty to protect those who don 't know any better in this case the ignorant gaijin from making the wrong choice let 's face it the way i wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards and they were doing their best to help me save face they think that choice as seen through the american lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans unfortunately these beliefs are based on assumptions that don 't always hold true in many countries in many cultures at times they don 't even hold true at america 's own borders i 'd like as i do so i hope you 'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds first assumption if a choice affects you then you should be the one to make it this is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for it is essential for success in america the primary locus of choice is the individual it 's called being true to yourself we brought seven to children into the laboratory and we divided them up into three groups the kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with when the second group of children came in they were brought to the same room shown the same anagrams but this time miss smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with now when the third group came in they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers the kids who were told what to do whether by miss smith or their mothers were actually given the very same activity which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen with this procedure we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity making it easier for us to compare performance such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them as compared to when it was chosen for them by miss smith or their mothers it didn 't matter who did the choosing if the task was dictated by another their performance suffered some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted one girl named mary said and least well when it had been chosen by miss smith a girl named natsumi even approached miss smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked could you please tell my mommy i did it just like she said but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected if they had a concept of being true to one 's self then that self most likely but of a collective success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one 's own preferences the assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses only holds when that self is clearly divided from others when in contrast two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected then they may amplify one another 's success by turning choosing into a collective act to insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their it leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and but it is a mistake to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone the second assumption which informs the american view of choice goes something like this so bring it on walmart with one hundred thousand different products fifteen million date possibilities now let 's test this assumption by heading over to eastern europe here i interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society one of the most interesting during the very first session which was run in russia one of the participants made a comment it 's all just soda that 's just one choice and i asked them how many choices are these not as seven you know research shows repeatedly that we can 't actually tell the difference between coke and pepsi of course you and i know that coke is the better choice for modern americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is little difference matters and so every choice matters the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge when asked what words and images do you associate for me it is fear there are some dilemmas you see i am used to no choice in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace we do not need everything that is there a sociologist from the warsaw survey agency explained the older generation jumped from nothing to choice all around them were never given a chance to learn how to react and tomasz a young polish man said but many of these choices are quite artificial in reality many choices are between things that are not that much different of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options americans train their whole lives to play spot the difference they practice this from such an early age that they 've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability in fact though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice we don 't all see choice in same places or to the same extent when someone can 't see how one choice is unlike another sometimes even afraid of it choice no longer offers opportunities but imposes it 's not a marker of liberation but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae in other words choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in america but it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice seems more attractive in theory than in practice we all have physical mental and emotional laughter limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter even in the grocery store let alone over the course of our entire lives yet still many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them this brings me to the third and perhaps most problematic assumption you must never say no to choice right outside chicago a young couple susan and daniel mitchell were about to have their first baby after her grandmother one night when susan was seven months pregnant she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room the baby was delivered through a c section but barbara suffered cerebral anoxia a loss of oxygen to the brain unable to breathe on her own she was put on a ventilator the doctors gave the mitchells a choice they could either remove barbara off the life support in which case she would die within a matter of hours or they could keep her on life support if she survived she would remain in a permanent vegetative state talk or interact with others what do they do what do any parent do american and french parents were interviewed they had all suffered the same tragedy and the infants had died there was a big difference while in the united states the final decision rested with the parents we wondered does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one we found that it did even up to a year later american parents were more likely to express negative emotions as compared to their french counterparts french parents were more likely to say things like he gave us a new perspective on life american parents were more likely to say things like what if another parent complained i feel as if they purposefully tortured me how did they get me to do that and another parent said i feel as if i 've played a role in an execution but when the american parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision they all said angry in a number of cases they were even clinically depressed these parents could not contemplate giving up the because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice in her essay the white album joan didion writes we tell ourselves stories in order to live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images by the idea with which we have learned to freeze which is our actual experience the story americans tell the story upon which the american dream depends is the story of limitless choice narrative happiness success it lays the world at your feet and says you can have anything everything it 's a great story and it 's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it but when you take a close look you start to see the holes but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn 't always work the phantasmagoria the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative varies from place to place moreover americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative which has been driving their choices for so robert frost once said that it is poetry that is lost in translation this suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving but joseph brodsky said that it is poetry that is gained in translation suggesting that translation can be a creative transformative act when it comes to choice we have far more to gain than to lose instead of replacing one story with another we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written no matter where we 're from we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do and what it can represent and this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism rather it brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn 't always deliver albeit through translation complexity thank you a detail and i guess one of the questions on everybody 's mind is how does that influence your study of choosing because that 's an activity that for most people is associated with visual inputs like funny that you should ask that because one of the things that 's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices and as you just mentioned there 's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days yeah i as you would expect get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because i have to rely on what other people suggest and i can 't decide and so one time i was in a beauty salon i was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink and one was called ballet slippers and the other one was called adorable and so i asked these two ladies and the one lady told me well you should definitely wear ' ballet slippers glamorous shade of pink and so i asked them well how do i tell them apart what 's different about them and they said well one is elegant the other one 's glamorous okay we got that and the only thing they had consensus on well if i could see them i would clearly be able to tell them apart and what i wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color so i decided to do a little experiment and i brought women into the laboratory and i asked them which one would you pick fifty percent of the women accused me of playing a trick of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles to wonder who the trick 's really played on now of the women that could tell them apart when the labels were off they picked adorable and when the labels were on they picked ballet slippers so as far as i can tell a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe even smells different"
