  "transcript": "they grow ten meters long some say bigger they might weigh up to two tons they 're also harmless plankton feeding animals and they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour they were very important to coastal communities going back hundreds of years especially around the claddaghduff connemara about thirty miles west of achill island to kill the basking sharks this is a woodcut from about the that oil was used especially for lighting but also for dressing wounds and other things in fact the streetlights in one thousand seven they 've been around a long time very important to coastal communities sharks used to come into the bay and the fishermen would tie a net off the headland string it out an curraghs and kill it with a lance through the back they also used we kill about one hundred million sharks a year so i don 't which suggests that they killed about twelve thousand sharks within this period literally just by stringing a manila rope off the tip of of keem bay up in achill island mid 80s especially out of places like dunmore east in county waterford about two and a half three thousand sharks were killed up till ' eighty five but these are norwegian basking shark hunting vessels the black line in the crow 's nest signifies this is a shark vessel rather than a the importance of basking sharks to to the coast communities is recognized through the language i don 't pretend to [ know many irish words ] but in kerry they were often known as the great fish of the sun that 's a lovely evocative name on tory island a strange place anyway they were known as muldoons no one seems to know why hope there 's no one from tory here lovely place but more commonly all around the island they were known as the sunfish and this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out there 's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout throughout the world they 're now listed as vulnerable under the they 're not protected in ireland in fact they have no legislative status in ireland whatsoever despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside behavior on the surface i only found out last year at a conference on the isle of man just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly frequently and predictably come to the surface to it 's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist to see and experience basking sharks they are awesome creatures it gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them to get access to them what we 've been doing for a couple years last year was a big year is we started tagging so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and we tagged them very simply not very high tech with a big long pole this is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end you go up in your boat and tag the shark and we were one hundred and five sharks last summer we got fifty in three days but it 's a very simple easy technique i 'll show you what it looks like these are archival tags depending on the and you have to kind of reconstruct the path what happens is you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period in this case eight months and literally to the day the tag popped off drifted up said hello to the satellite and and here 's a couple of maps that we 've done in that one here 's one we haven 't colleagues from the isle of man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the isle of man to nova scotia nine and a half thousand kilometers we never thought that happened another colleague in the states tagged about twenty sharks off massachusetts his tags didn 't really work all he knows and even in brazil basking sharks were temperate animals and lived in one thing that i think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is i 'm not a geneticist so i won to understand the genetics and that 's why it 's great to have collaboration whereas i 'm a field person i get panic attacks if i have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on take me away they found that the diversity was incredibly low if you look at the first line really you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar come from a common ancestry which is more genetics that are passed on through the parents you see that basking sharks if you look at the first study was order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species you can see this work was only done in two thousand and six before two thousand and six we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks we had no idea did they distinguish into different populations so so he did another study using so it does seem to be that basking sharks for some reason have incredibly low diversity and it 's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck and this has caused a very low diversity and yet if you look at the whale shark which is the other plankton eating large its diversity is much greater so it doesn 't really make sense at all they found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world 's oceans of basking sharks even though they 're found throughout the world you couldn 't tell the difference genetically from one from the pacific atlantic new zealand i don 't understand or pretend to understand this i suspect most geneticists don 't either but they produce the numbers so you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics and rus hoelzel came up with an effective population size eight thousand two hundred animals that 's it eight thousand animals in the world you 're thinking and he found out it came out about nine thousand using different microsatellites gave the different results but the mean of all these studies but even if you toss a few numbers around you 're probably talking an effective population of about twenty thousand animals do you remember how many they killed off achill in the 70s and the 50s so what it tells us actually is that there 's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small in fact of those twenty thousand eight thousand were thought to be females there i don 't believe it the problem with this is they were didn 't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail so where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis another source would be fisheries ' bycatch we were getting quite a few caught in in surface drift nets that 's banned now and some are caught in nets in trawls this is a shark that was actually landed in howth so if you look at all those studies i showed you the total number of but they 're constrained by lack of samples when we were out tagging our sharks this is how we tagged them on on the front of a rib get in there fast occasionally the sharks do react on one occasion when we were up in malin head in the shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail more i think in startle to the fact that a boat came near it rather than and then when myself and emmett got back to to malin head i noticed some black slime on the front of the boat i used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats and i remember fishermen saying they can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net because it leaves a black slime behind we would use conventional methods i have a crossbow you see it in my hand there because the shark 's skin is just so strong there was no way we were going to get a sample from that so when i saw the black slime on the on the bow of the boat i thought if you take what you 're given in this world so i scraped it off i had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists so i scraped the slime off and sent it to aberdeen and said but i kept emailing les saying have you had a chance to look at my slime he might lose face if he hadn 't done the thing i sent him and he was amazed that they actually got dna from the slime they amplified it and they tested it and they found yes this was actually basking shark so he was very excited it became known as simon 's shark slime so having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags i then thought i 'd invest seven point nine five the price is still on it in my local hardware store in kilrush for a mop handle and i wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks and this was into august now and normally sharks peak in june july and you rarely see them or rarely can be in the right place to find sharks into august we were desperate so we rushed out to the blaskets as soon as we heard there were sharks there and managed to find some sharks so by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat you see a shark running under the boat here and here it is look at that lovely black we got five samples five individual sharks were sampled using simon 's shark slime sampling system and you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind and i was thinking of but hey sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come so this is possibly going to be my my legacy that is very useful is that we use a pole camera this is my colleague joanne with a pole camera where you can look underneath if we can tell the gender of the shark before we which i find staggering because they don 't know what primers to look for being able to tell the gender of a shark is very important for things like policing the trade in in basking shark and other species through the sightings because it is illegal to trade and they are caught and are on the market so as a field biologist you just want to get encounters with these animals and learn as much as you can they 're often quite brief they 're often very seasonally constrained you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can but isn 't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines such as the geneticists who can gain so much more from that but if you 're more interested we have a basking shark website now set up so thank you and thank you for listening"
