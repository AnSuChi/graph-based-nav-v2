  "transcript": "their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers we control this planet how did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes minding their own business in a corner of africa into the rulers of we want to believe i want to believe that there is something special about me i 'm embarrassingly similar similar to a chimpanzee i would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee and this is not something wrong with me personally the chimpanzee would do much better the real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level it 's on the collective level humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers but they don 't do so flexibly their cooperation is very rigid there is basically just one way in which a beehive can function and if there 's a new opportunity or a new the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight execute the queen and establish a republic of bees or a communist dictatorship of worker bees other animals like the social mammals the wolves the elephants the dolphins the chimpanzees because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge one of the other i 'm a chimpanzee and you 're a chimpanzee and i want to cooperate with you i need to know you personally how can i cooperate one versus one or even ten versus ten chimpanzees might be better than us but if you pit one thousand humans against one thousand chimpanzees the humans will win easily for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all and if you now try to cram one hundred thousand chimpanzees into oxford street or into wembley stadium or tienanmen square or the vatican complete chaos just imagine wembley stadium with one hundred thousand chimpanzees complete madness what we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation i 'm standing here in front of an audience of about three hundred or four hundred people most of you are complete strangers to me i don 't know i don 't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that i read in preparation for this talk and i certainly don 't know all the people who might be we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas this is something chimpanzees cannot do they communicate but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants or anything else that might interest chimpanzees now cooperation is of course not always nice all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history and we have been doing some very horrible are a system of cooperation slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation concentration camps are a system of cooperation chimpanzees don 't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers the next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener the answer we can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers and as long as everybody believes in the same fiction everybody obeys and follows the same rules the same norms the same values all other animals use their communication system only to describe reality let 's go and get bananas but also to create new realities fictional realities a human can say and if you don 't do what i tell you to do when you die god will punish you and send you to hell and you can cooperate this is something only humans can do you can never and you 'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds so now give me this banana no chimpanzee will ever believe such a story which is why we control the world whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories now you may find it acceptable that yes millions of people come together to build a cathedral or mass scale human cooperation not only in the religious field take the legal field but what are human rights the only place you find the most important factors in modern politics are states and nations but a nation or a state like israel or iran or france or germany this is just a story that we 've invented and became extremely attached to the most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations many of you today perhaps work for like google or toyota or mcdonald 's what exactly are these things they are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers but then came along these master storytellers the prime ministers and they tell us a very convincing story look you see this green piece of paper it is actually worth ten bananas and if i believe it and you believe it and everybody believes it it actually works i can take this worthless piece of paper go to the supermarket give it to a complete stranger whom i 've never met before and get in exchange real bananas which i can actually eat this is something amazing you could never do it with chimpanzees but you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana no way what do you think i am a human money in fact is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans because it is the only story everybody believes not everybody believes in god but everybody believes in money the dollar bill take but he had no objection to american dollars he was quite fond of them actually to conclude then we humans control the world because we live in a dual reality but over the centuries we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality and what is amazing is that as history the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional after sapiens you wrote another one and it in the book if i understand it correctly you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better but they will create and i quote you new classes and new class struggles just as the industrial revolution did can you elaborate for us ynh yes in the industrial revolution we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat and much of the political and social history of the last two hundred years involved what to do with this class and the new problems and opportunities now we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people as computers become better and better in more a distinct possibility that computers will out perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant and then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be what do we need humans for or at least what do we need so many humans for bg do you have an answer in the book ynh this doesn 't sound like a very appealing future bg ok so you 're basically saying in the book and now that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality we are just kind of at the beginning of the process ynh again it 's not a prophecy it 's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us one possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people and the poor being degraded to this level of useless useless people bg i feel there is another ted talk coming up in a year or two thank you"
