  "transcript": "and i am illustrating still still doing this or that i don 't answer because i 'm not doing things still i 'm doing it like i always did i still have or did i use the word which is called i have my clients i am doing my work like i always did so this takes care this was all of these things were made during the last doing more or less what you see here this is castleton china this was an exhibition at the museum of modern art this is now for sale at the metropolitan museum this is still at the metropolitan museum now for sale this is a portrait of my daughter and myself these were just some of the things i call myself a maker of things i don 't call myself an industrial designer because i 'm other things industrial designers novelty is a concept industrial design magazine i believe is called innovation innovation is not part of the aim of my work make things more beautiful more elegant more comfortable well to describe our profession otherwise we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty that means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of man sarah who was a mathematics professor at mit wrote the playful search for beauty was man 's first activity that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty these are tiles the word playful is a necessary aspect of our work because actually one of our problems is that lovely things so how can you without drying up make things with the same pleasure as a gift to others for so long the playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer let me tell you some i started to do these things exhibition in the united states was at the sesquicentennial exhibition in took me this is not that they took me the work didn 't take me i made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world which then finally did take me to see many countries i started as an apprentice and this taught me what the guild system was in middle ages the guild system that means when i was an apprentice i had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master there was a traditional hierarchy of master journeyman and learned worker as an apprentice was very primitive that means i had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery pottery by hand we mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the and then finally it was prepared for the for the and there i really worked as an apprentice the time and finally i had received a document that i had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully that i had behaved morally i also got at the time a workbook which explained my and made pottery which i sold and my i didn 't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today but my boyfriend and so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity however after a while there was a new factory being built in budapest a pottery and i visited it with several ladies and asked all sorts of questions of the director then the director asked me why do you ask all these questions i said i also have a pottery could he please visit me and then finally he did and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an anachronism that the industrial revolution had broken out and that i rather should join the factory there he made an art department for me everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department the director there said there were several women and this was sold also to so finally they got a letter from the center from the bank who owned the factory saying make so this gave me the possibility because now i was a journeyman and journeymen also take their satchel and go so as a journeyman i put an ad into the paper that i had studied that i was a down to earth potter 's journeyman and i was looking for a job as got several answers and and that was in hamburg at an art pottery where everything was done and so i worked in a shop where there were several and the first day i was coming to take my place at the turntable there were three or four turntables and one of who smelled very bad so i doused him in and therefore he brought bread and butter every day which i had to eat out of courtesy the first day i came to work in this shop there was on my my wheel a surprise for me my colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where i was supposed to work a very nicely modeled they were very i finally and worked there for some six months this was my first job go on like this you will be here till midnight i have to tell you that within five minutes i will talk very fast and actually my work took me to many countries because i and and eventually purges at the beginning of stalin 's purges i didn 't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested so i was arrested and spent sixteen months in a russian prison this was a very dangerous and if this is the end of my five minutes i want to tell you that i actually and since this is the end of the five minutes i will moderator tell me when your last trip to russia was and they came to my studio in rockland county and brought the fifteen of their and they invited myself to come to the russian factory last summer they also invited my so we had a lovely trip to see russia today which is not a very pleasant and happy view if this is the end"
