  "transcript": "and i 've been thinking a lot about what i have learned over these last particularly eleven years with v day and the vagina monologues traveling the world essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race the getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the reducing these cells and it is essential to balance to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us and then i want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion and and then let 's remember that we 've been which is one of my favorites how do we bring up boys what does it mean to be a boy to be a boy really means not to be a girl i actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we 've had to train everyone not to be that suppressing girl suppressing emotion refusing feeling has lead thus here where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence the destruction of the earth is completely out of control and because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our we do not feel what is going on so we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo i feel up to that point i had seen a lot in the world a lot of violence i essentially lived in the rape mines world for the last twelve years but the democratic republic of congo really i went and i spent time in a place called bukavu in a hospital called the panzi hospital with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person i 've ever met his name is dr denis mukwege the congo for those of you who don 't know there has been a war raging for the last twelve years a war that has killed nearly six million people it is estimated that somewhere between three hundred thousand and five hundred thousand women have been raped there when i spent my first weeks at panzi hospital i sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories their stories were so horrific and so on the other side of human existence that to be perfectly honest with you i was shattered and i will tell you that what happened is through that shattering listening to the stories of eight year old girls who had their insides eviscerated who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside listening to the story of 80 year old women who were tied to all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the west can have it and profit from them but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been emboldened that shattering that opening of that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart i want to say that i think the powers that be know that is actually that feelings get in the way of empire building feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the earth and excavating the earth and destroying things i remember for example when my father and he would actually say while he was beating me don 't you cry don 't you dare cry i know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell and i want to say we 've annihilated it in men as well as in women and i think in some ways we 've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell i see how boys have been brought up and i see this across the planet to be tough to be hardened i actually realized once in kosovo when i watched a man break down that bullets are actually hardened tears that when we don 't allow men to have their to pretend they know things when they don 't know things or why would we be where we are to pretend they 're not a mess when they are a mess and i will tell you a very funny story on my way here on the airplane i was walking up and down the aisle of the plane all these men literally at least ten men were in their little seats watching chick flicks and they were all alone and i thought this is the secret life of men and i 've seen if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it 's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world and we heard from sunitha yesterday and kavita about what we do to girls but i just want to say that i 've seen girls be treated like garbage cans i 've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles i 've seen girls starving themselves to death in america in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves or we make them feel bad about being too smart we silence them we make them feel guilty for being smart we get them to behave but i also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of ten to to twenty four they are they key really in the developing world as well as in the whole world to the future of humanity will in my belief and that 's the girl inside us and the girl and what i want to suggest is that having talked to girls because i just finished a new book called i am an emotional creature the secret life of girls around the world i 've been talking to girls for five years and one of the things that i 've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that 's been enforced on girl if we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them and i have to now share a few stories of girls i 've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl i know a 14 year old girl in the netherlands for example who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself there is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed fifty six stars tattooed on the right side of her face julia butterfly hill who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks and this girl when she was seventeen years old wore a burqa in afghanistan and went into the stadiums and i want to talk about a girl that i just met recently in bukavu who was impregnated by her rapist and she was holding her baby and i asked her if she loved her baby and she looked into her baby 's eyes and she said of course i love my baby how could i not love my baby it 's my baby and it 's full of love the capacity for girls to overcome situations and to and i just met her in kenya dorcas is fifteen years old and she was trained in a few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men and through her self defense she grabbed their adam 's apples she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car i went to visit one of the v day safe houses for girls a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes pareyio agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl she was female genitally mutilated and she made a decision so for years agnes walked through the rift valley she taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like what a and in that time she saved many girls and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her and she said well if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster and then she saved four thousand five hundred girls and then we asked her okay what else do you need and she said well now i need a house so seven years ago agnes built the first v day safe house in narok kenya in the masai land they could save their clitoris they wouldn 't be cut they could go to school and in the years that agnes has had the house she has changed the situation there she has literally become deputy mayor she 's changed the rules the whole community has bought in to what she 's doing when we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls who have run away with their families and there was a young girl named jaclyn jaclyn was fourteen years old and she was in her masai family and she knew that meant she wouldn 't have a future she knew she would have to marry that old man and she was fourteen jaclyn left her father 's house and she walked for two days she imagined her father killing her on one hand and mama agnes greeting her with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house and when she got to the house she was greeted agnes took her in and agnes loved her and agnes supported her for the year she went to school and she found her voice and she found her identity and she found her heart then her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation after a year i had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled in that hut we and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled and her primary mother who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders when her father saw her and saw who she had become in her full girl self he threw his arms and i give you my word here and now that we will not cut your sisters either but i promise you now that i will be educated i will always take care and i will come back and i will build you a house that is the power of girls and that is the power of transformation i want to close and and i want to do it for the girls that sunitha talked about yesterday the girls who survive the girls who can become to value the part that 's emotional to value the part that 's vulnerable to understand that 's where the future lies this is called i 'm an emotional creature and it happened because i met a girl in watts l a i was asking girls if they like being a girl and all the girls were like i 'm an emotional creature i am an emotional creature they pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears oh i can tell you he won 't call back it 's a vibe i i am connected to everything and everyone i was born like that don they make me ready there is a particular way of knowing it 's like the older women somehow forgot i know my father isn 't coming back i know that one kiss could take away all my know what sometimes it should this is not extreme it 's a girl thing what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open don 't tell me not to cry to calm it down not to be i can take i love that i can feel the feelings inside you they make me responsible i am an emotional"
