  "transcript": "i remember the very first time i went to a nice restaurant a really nice restaurant it so i said sure i 'll take would you like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay stop with the fancy french words and just give me some white wine and so i told her that i would take the chardonnay because frankly that was the easiest one to pronounce i didn 't come from the elites i didn 't come from the northeast or from san francisco and it 's a town that 's really struggling in a lot of ways ways that are indicative of the broader struggles of america and there 's a very unique sense of pessimism that 's moved in think about rising mortality rates in these communities and recognize that for a lot of these folks the problems that they 're seeing are actually causing rising death rates in their own communities so there 's a very real sense of struggle i had a very seat to that struggle my family has been part of that struggle for a very long time the addiction that plagued my community also plagued my family and even sadly my own mom there were a lot of problems that i saw in my own family problems caused sometimes by a lack of access to resources and social capital that really affected my life if you had looked at my life when i was fourteen years old and said well what 's going to happen to this kid you would have concluded that i would have struggled with what academics call upward mobility so upward mobility and it measures whether kids like me who grow up in poor communities are going to live a better life whether they 're going to have a chance to live a materially better existence or whether they 're going to stay in the circumstances where they came from and one of the things we 've learned unfortunately is that upward mobility isn 't as high as we 'd like it to be in this country it 's very geographically distributed so take utah for instance but if you think of where i 'm from in the south in appalachia in southern ohio it 's very unlikely that kids like that will rise the american dream in those parts of the country is so why is that happening so one reason is obviously economic or structural so you think of these areas they 're beset by these terrible economic trends built around industries like coal and steel that make it harder for folks to get ahead that 's there 's also the problem of where the really talented people because they can 't find high skilled work at home end up moving elsewhere so they don 't build a business or non profit where they 're from there are failing schools in a lot of these communities failing to give kids the educational leg up that really makes it possible for kids to have opportunities later in life these things are all important i don 't mean to discount these structural barriers but when i look back at my life and my community something else was going on something else mattered there was a very real sense of hopelessness in the community that i grew up in there was a sense that kids had that their choices didn 't matter nothing good would happen so let 's just take one political issue that 's pretty hot affirmative action so depending on your politics you might think that affirmative action is either a wise or an unwise way to promote diversity in the workplace or the classroom you see it as something that isn 't just about good or bad policy you see it as something that 's actively conspiring where people with political and financial power are working against you you can say i 'm not going to work hard because no matter how hard i work it 's not going to matter another thing you might do is say well i 'm not going to go after the traditional markers of success like a university education or a prestigious job because the people who care about those things they 're never going to let me in when i got admitted to yale a family member asked me if i had pretended to be a liberal to get by the admissions committee but it speaks to a very real insecurity in these places that you have to pretend to be somebody you 're not to get past these various social barriers it 's i didn 't know that elite universities as research consistently tells us are cheaper for low income kids because these universities have bigger endowments can offer more generous financial aid i remember i learned this when i got the financial aid letter from yale for myself but i turned to my aunt when i got that letter and said you know i think this just means that for the first time in my life being poor has paid really i didn 't have access to that information because the social networks around me didn 't have access to that information but i didn 't learn how to get ahead i didn 't learn how to make the good decisions about education and opportunity that you need to century knowledge economy economists call the value that we gain from our informal networks from our friends and colleagues and family social capital and it showed there 's something else that 's really important that 's going on that our community doesn 't like to talk about but it 's very real and they 're pretty commonplace in my family so my grandparents they were able to earn a good wage in a steel mill but what ended up happening is that they exposed their kids to a lot of the childhood trauma that had gone back many generations my mom was twelve when she saw my grandma set my his crime i 'm gonna kill you and she tried to do it but a study by the wisconsin children 's trust fund found that forty percent of twenty nine percent for upper income kids and think about what that really means if you 're a low income kid almost half of you face multiple instances of childhood trauma this is not an isolated problem this is a very significant issue we know what happens to the kids who experience that life they 're more likely to do drugs more likely to go to jail more likely to drop out of high school they 're more likely to do to their children what their parents did to them and it 's a gift that keeps on the low social capital but something unexpected happened i did beat the odds things turned up for me i graduated from so what happened well they made sure that when my parents weren 't able to do the things that kids need they stepped in and that role my grandma especially did two things that really matter one she provided that peaceful home that allowed me to focus on homework and the things that kids should be focused on but she was also this incredibly perceptive woman despite not even having a middle school education she recognized the message that my community had for me that my choices didn 't matter you can do anything you want to the other thing that really helped was the united states marine corps so we think of the marine corps as a outfit and of course it is the us marine corps was a four year crash course in character education it taught me how to make a bed how to do laundry how to wake up early how to manage my finances these are things my community didn 't teach me i remember when i went to go buy a car for the very first time i was offered a dealer 's low low interest rate of twenty one point nine percent and i was ready because i went and took it to my officer who told me stop being an idiot go to the local credit union and get a better deal and so that 's what i did but without the marine corps i would have never had access to that knowledge i would have had a financial calamity frankly the last thing i want to say is that i had a lot of good fortune in the mentors and people who have played an important role in my life from the marines from ohio state from yale from other places people have really stepped in and ensured that they filled that social capital gap that it was pretty obvious apparently that i had but a lot of children aren 't going to have that good fortune and i think that raises really important questions for all of us about how we 're going to change that we need to ask questions about how we 're going to give low income kids who come from a broken home access to a loving home we need to ask questions about how we 're going to teach low income parents how to better interact with their children with their partners we mentorship to low income kids who don 't have it we need to think about how we teach working class children about but also soft skills like conflict resolution and financial management but i do know this there 's a kid wondering whether when he comes through the door he 'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly there 's a kid whose mom sticks a needle in her arm and passes out there 's a kid who has no hope for the future but i know that unless our society starts asking better questions"
