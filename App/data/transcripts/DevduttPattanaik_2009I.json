  "transcript": "to understand the business of mythology and what a chief belief officer is supposed to do you have to hear a story of ganesha kartikeya the two brothers kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the simply walked around his parents once if you understand the difference between ' the world ' and ' my world ' you understand the difference between logos and mythos ' logical universal factual scientific ' it 's it 's the myth that we live in ' the world ' tells us how we are born ' my world ' tells us why we were born every culture is trying to understand itself why do we exist and every culture comes up with its own understanding of life its own customized version of mythology and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of and so when you study it you realize different people see things differently different viewpoints there is my world and there is your world yours is faith yours is illogical hundred and twenty six b c now in pakistan this river lends itself to india 's name a young macedonian met there like bahubali over here the gomateshwara bahubali whose image is not far from mysore or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock staring at the sky and the sun and the moon alexander asked what are you doing and the gymnosophist answered i 'm experiencing nothingness then the gymnosophist asked what are you doing and alexander said i am conquering the world each one thought that the other was a fool it 's pointless and alexander thought why is he sitting around doing nothing what a waste of a life to understand this difference in viewpoints we have to understand the subjective truth of alexander his myth and the mythology that constructed it alexander 's mother his parents his teacher aristotle told him the story of homer 's iliad they told him of a great hero called achilles defeat was inevitable achilles was a man who could shape and this is what you should be alexander that 's what he heard what should you not be you should not be sisyphus who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night mediocre like jason who went across the sea with the argonauts and fetched the golden fleece be spectacular like theseus who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull headed minotaur win the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods you will be welcomed to elysium or what the french call but these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard and then he went to the and he wanted to hoist his flag to say i was here first but when he reached the mountain peak he found the peak covered with countless flags of each i was here first ' that 's what i thought until i came here like ram raghupati ram and krishna govinda but they were not two characters on two different adventures they were two lifetimes of the same hero it was called the vaitarani and so you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built you dunk it in the river because it has to end and next year she will come back you see the gods but the same life is lived which is right the other believes this is one of many lives so no matter what he did it was always and i believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired indian mathematicians to discover the number zero who knows if the gymnosophist 's belief influences his behavior then it was bound to influence the business they were in what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves and if you look at cultures around the world all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business take a look absolute truth standardization linear patterns in design but if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic with opinion with contextual thinking with everything is relative sort of mostly laughter the kuchipudi dancer curvaceous and then look at business sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land with the commandments held by the leader you will go to heaven but in india there is no the promised land there are indian music for example does not have the concept of harmony there is no orchestra conductor it is not about documentation and contract it 's about conversation getting the job done by bending or breaking the rules just look at your indian people around here you 'll see them smile they know what it is and then look at people who have done business in india you 'll see the exasperation on their faces you see this is what india is today the ground reality is based on a cyclical world view so it 's rapidly changing highly diverse chaotic the demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in which is rooted in one life culture i have personally experienced it i 'm trained as a medical doctor i did not want to study surgery don 't ask me why i love mythology too much i wanted to learn mythology but there is nowhere you can study so i had to teach it to myself and mythology does not pay well until now and i worked as a marketing guy and a sales guy and a knowledge guy please tell us the process to invoice hospitals how do you put it in a nice little software you can 't you see he has established the largest retail chain called big bazaar and he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets and he knew very intuitively that best practices developed in japan and china and europe and america will not work in india so he had asked me to be the chief but belief is not measurable you can 't measure it you can 't manage it so how do you construct belief how do you enhance the sensitivity of people to indian ness even if you are indian it is not very explicit it is not very obvious so i tried to work on the standard model of culture which is develop symbols and rituals and i will share one of the rituals with you you see it is based on the hindu ritual of darshan hindus don 't have the concept of commandments so there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life so you 're not really sure how you stand in front of god so when you go to the temple all you seek is an audience with god you want to see god sometimes made of silver so they look at you because you don 't know whether you 're right or wrong and so all you seek is divine empathy just know where i came from why i did the jugaad please after completes his training and is about to take over the store we blindfold him the customer his family his team his boss he realizes that to succeed he has to include all these people the customer is happy because the customer is god that sensitivity is what we need once this belief and it then we come back to alexander and to the gymnosophist and everybody asks me which is the better way this way or that way and it 's a very dangerous question because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence what i will give you is an indian answer the indian"
