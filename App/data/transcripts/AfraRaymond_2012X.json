  "transcript": "and corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself or in the case of our context your friends and we need to understand and we have to admit that we have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it the first thing is that the big myth number one is that in fact it 's not when we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country nobody 's speaking about corruption that 's the honest truth when the commissioner of police comes on tv to talk about crime he isn 't speaking about corruption and we know for sure when the minister of national security is speaking about crime he 's not the point i 'm making is that it is a crime because we 're involving the looting of taxpayers ' money public and private corruption is a reality as somebody who comes from the private sector i can tell you there 's a massive amount of corruption in the private sector that has nothing to do with government the same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table it all takes place in the private sector which the private sector also participates in the second important myth to understand because we have to destroy these myths dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them the second important myth to understand is the one that says that in fact it probably will and i want to demonstrate that that too and i want to speak a little bit take us back about thirty years we 're coming out today from trinidad and tobago because and the central bank is responsible for a lot of the things i 'm going to be speaking about okay we 're talking about irresponsibility in public office speaking about the fact that across the terrace the next tower is the ministry of finance and there 's a lot of connection with us today so we 're speaking within your temple today okay we embarked the government of the day embarked on a series of and some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government to government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world the united states and britain and france and so on and so on it became so outrageous the whole situation that in fact a commission of inquiry was and it reported in and immediately the government to government arrangements were stopped and he said some things that i 'll never forget and he said that in fact let me see if this thing works are we getting two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent the taxpayers ' money was wasted or stolen so the ten or fifteen percent is pure mischief as we two thirds of the money stolen or wasted i don 't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience but i have to we call it the section suspicious piece of law and i 'm going to say it like it is a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects those people are called they are the piarco airport and i have labeled it the plot to pervert parliament our highest institution in our country was perverted we are dealing with perverts here of an economic and financial nature do you get how serious this problem is there was massive protest a lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms so parliament was swiftly reconvened and the law was reversed it was repealed that 's the word lawyers use it was repealed but the point is because what really happened is that because of the suspicious passage of that law the law was actually passed into effect and for the first time that i could remember and that gave me a lot of hope okay those of us who are sometimes you feel like you 're a little bit on your own doing some of this work that passage of the law and the repeal of the law fortified the case but what were they accused of what was it that they were accused of i 'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there what were they accused of we were trying to build or reconstruct largely an airport that had grown outdated the entire project cost about one point six billion and in we had a lot of bid rigging and suspicious activity corrupt activity took place and to get an idea of what it consisted of and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing we can look at this second slide here and what we have here i am not saying so this is the director of public prosecutions in a written statement he said so and he 's telling us that for the $ one point six billion cost of the project one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts one billion dollars of our taxpayers ' money has been located in offshore bank accounts and i 'm going to pause here i 'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things i 'm going to pause here and bring in something i saw in november and i was walking around with the protesters looking at the one wall street occupy wall street movement walking around and what it said on that sign hit me right in the center it said if you 're not outraged you haven 't been paying attention if you 're not outraged by all of this you haven 't been paying attention so well what if because i 'm suspicious like that i read a lot of spy novels and stuff what if but to make it in these wrongs you have to read a lot of spy novels and follow some of if this wasn 't the first time what if this is just the first time that the so and sos had been caught what if it had happened before how would i find out now the previous two examples i gave were to do with construction sector okay so those of you interested in finding out more about it or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions but i 'm going to segue to another thing that relates because one of my private campaigns i 've been conducting for over three and a half years is for transparency and accountability around the bailout of cl financial cl financial is the caribbean 's largest ever and without getting into all of the details it is said to have collapsed i 'm using my words very carefully it 's said to have collapsed which is just coming up to nearly four years in an unprecedented fit of generosity and you have to be very suspicious about these people and i can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn 't happened anywhere else on the planet let 's understand because we lack context people are telling us it trinidad and tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something it 's not just like anywhere it 's not just like anywhere it 's not just like anywhere here is here and out there is out there they 've had bailouts they 've had bailouts in europe in africa they 've had bailouts in nigeria six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours eh it 's interesting to parallel how the nigerian experience has and they 've treated it very well compared to us nowhere on the planet have all the creditors been bailed out so what was the reason for the generosity let 's look at it let 's look into it so i started digging and writing and so and so on and that work can be found my personal work can be found at it 's a not for profit blog that i run not as popular as some of the other people but there you go but the point is that the bitter experience of section thirty four plot to pervert parliament that bitter experience that took place forced me to check myself and to go back into some of the work some of the stuff i 'd written and some of the exchanges i 'd had with the officials to see what was really what as we say in trinidad and tobago who is who and what and i made a freedom of information application in may this year to the ministry of finance the ministry of finance is the next tower over this is the other context the ministry of finance we are told is subject to the provisions of the freedom of information act i 'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that 's really so the central bank in which we stand this morning that is the law since one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine so you could understand as i said where we are here is not like anywhere else question number one and if you can 't show me the accounts so they hit my question with a question second point i want to see who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid let me pause here to point out to you all billion dollars of our money has been spent on this that is about three and a half billion u s dollars coming out of a small the name of and that person made a career and the most famous case was what we came to call the secret scholarship scandal in fact there was about sixty million dollars in government money and he was able to get the court using that act of parliament freedom of information act fantastic the question is this if it 's right and proper for us to use the freedom of information act and to use the court it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about twenty four billion dollars you see the third thing i will tell you is that i also asked whether in fact they were making filings under our integrity in public life act we have an integrity in public life act as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation 's and public officials are supposed to file to say what it is we have a situation where the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded i 've asked the question in the legal and required fashion it 's been ignored i have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country 's history it 's also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation and this is my reality where you have an expenditure of public money and it is without accountability and that is what we are dealing with here i 'm going to continue the work to press on to get we will continue to press on we had the journalist [ heather ] brooke speaking about her battle against government corruption and she introduced me to this website information applications and speak with each other i could see what you 're applying for the final thing i want to say and it 's important for us to tune into this one is really important a good one to log on to and see"
