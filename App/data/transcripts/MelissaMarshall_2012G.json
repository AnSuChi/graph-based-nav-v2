  "transcript": "penn state asked me a communications teacher to teach a communications class for engineering students but as these conversations unfolded i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world that 's just how i felt as i had those conversations with the students i was amazed at the and i believe the key to opening that door is great communication we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges from energy to environment to health care among others but these great conversations can 't occur if our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to see their wonderland so scientists and engineers please talk nerdy to us i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging first question to answer for us so what tell us why your science is relevant to us don 't just tell me that you study trabeculae and when you 're describing your science beware of jargon jargon is a barrier to understanding of your ideas sure you can say spatial and temporal but why not just say space and time which is so much more accessible to us and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down instead as einstein said make everything as simple as possible but no simpler you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas and when presenting your work drop the bullet points have you ever wondered why they 're called bullet points what do bullets do bullets kill and they will kill your presentation a slide like this is not are so strong that they actually inspired readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what 's being described so scientists and engineers"
