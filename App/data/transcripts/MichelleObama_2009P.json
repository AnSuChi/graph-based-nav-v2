  "transcript": "this is my first trip my first foreign trip as a first lady can you believe that and while this is not my first visit to the u k i have to say that i am glad that this is my first official visit the special relationship between the united states and the u k is based and i 'm reminded of that during my visit i 've been especially honored to meet some of britain 's most extraordinary women and i 'm honored to meet you the future leaders of great britain and although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant with me standing here as the first lady of the i want you to know that we have very much in common for nothing in my life 's path would have predicted that i 'd be standing here as the first first lady of the united states of america there is nothing in my story that would land me here wasn 't raised with wealth or resources or any social standing to speak of and i was the product of a working class community my father was a city worker and she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother neither of them attended university but even as it got harder for him to walk and get dressed in the morning i saw him struggle more and more my father never complained about his struggle he was grateful for what he had he just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder and my brother and i were raised with all that you really need love strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work that there was nothing that we could not do i am an example of what 's possible when girls from the of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them i was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life neighbors who taught me about and my the most important role model in my life who lives with us at the white house malia and sasha she 's an active presence in their lives as well as mine and is instilling in them and perseverance all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love i was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged they taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between that it 's built on faith and commitment they taught me about what it means to be a father and to raise a family and not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help raise kids in the broader community and these were the same qualities that i looked for one of the things that i remember is that he took me out on a date and his date was to go with him to a community helping people to find jobs and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods as he talked to the residents in that community center he talked about two concepts he talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be and i talked about this throughout the entire campaign what he said that all too often is that we accept but barack reminded us on that day all of us in that room that we all know what our world should look like we all know and he urged the people in that meeting in that community to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should and i think about that today because i am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap you are the women who will build the world as it should be but for your generation and that 's why why getting a good education is so important that 's why all of this that you 're going through the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don 't why it 's so important because communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women and that 's important to keep in mind the difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman the difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls and this school named after the u k ' s first female doctor and the surrounding buildings named for mexican artist mary seacole the jamaican nurse known as the black florence nightingale racism and ignorance to pursue they allowed for no obstacles as the sign said back there and having done so these women and they opened many new doors for millions of female doctors and nurses and artists and authors all of whom have please remember that i never did it i loved getting and you too with these same values can control your own destiny you too can pave the way you too can realize your dreams and then your job is to reach back and to help someone just like you do the same thing history proves that it doesn 't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate your success will be determined by your own fortitude your own confidence your own individual hard work that is true that is the reality of the world that we live in and it won 't be easy that 's for sure but you have everything you need everything you need to succeed you already have right here my husband works they call it the oval office in the white house there 's the desk that he sits at it 's called the it was built by the timber of her majesty 's ship resolute and given by queen victoria it 's an enduring symbol of and its name resolute is a reminder of the strength of character that 's required not only to lead a country but to live a life of purpose you all remain resolute that you go forward and that you use your talents because there are many we 've seen them it 's there that you use them to create the world as it should be because we are counting on you we are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be because the world is big confident young women to stand up and take the reins we know you can do it we love you thank you so much"
