  "transcript": "we can tap or as i like to use the the scientific term people because we are all patients we are all people even doctors are patients at some point so i want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have have failed to engage with very well in this country and in fact worldwide if you want to get at the big part i mean from a public health level where my training is you 're looking at you 're looking at things where people are actually given information and they 're not following through with it 's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes obesity many forms of heart disease even some forms of cancer when you think of smoking now behavior change is something that that is a long standing problem in in medicine it goes all the way back to aristotle and doctors hate it right i mean they complain about it all the time we talk about it in terms of engagement or when people don 't take their pills when people don 't follow doctors ' orders these are behavior problems but for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change there 's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem decision making giving information to people in a form that doesn 't just actually leads them to make better decisions better choices in their lives one part of medicine though has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well and that 's dentistry but they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it it 's so i 'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in connecticut cooked up so it 's an easy story to tell so these connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush they had a big patient population they divided them up into two groups they had a low fear population where they basically gave them a 13 minute presentation you will lose your teeth but you 'll get dentures and it won 't be that bad so they showed bloody gums they showed puss oozing out from between their teeth they told them that their teeth were going to fall out they said that they could have infections that would spread from their their jaws to other parts of their bodies and ultimately yes they would lose their teeth they would get dentures you weren 't going to be able to eat so go brush and floss your teeth this was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their and the people who said so the upshot was this the upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all the people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen it 's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior so i want to isolate this because it was a great observation who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one that you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health that they can actually see their way towards getting better health 's a very important notion it 's an amazing notion and this is a great example of how we haven 't learned that lesson at all this is a campaign from the american diabetes association this is still the way we 're communicating messages about health i showed my three year old this slide last night when you give people specific information about their health and that doesn 't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers this overload of health information that 're inundated with but it actually hits home it 's not just hitting us in our heads it 's hitting us in our hearts there 's an emotional connection to information because it 's from us we need to connect the information always with the action now this is a very notion for behavior change but the problem is that things until the choice in this case is pretty simple we either keep going fast or we slow down we should probably slow down and that point of action is probably now we should take our foot off the pedal right now they last for about five miles but it works and it even has some health repercussions your blood pressure might drop a little bit maybe there 's fewer accidents so there 's public health benefits but by and large it 's very difficult to nobody 's had the brilliant idea of calling but it looks completely right right so it 's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information and it just sounds perfect and then we turn the page of the magazine and we see this now this is the page the fda requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads to follow their ads and to me this is one of the most cynical exercises in medicine because we know who among us would actually say that people read this and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of so this is a different approach this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth and they created this thing called the drug facts box they took inspiration from of all things cap 'n crunch they went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal works for our it says very clearly what the drug is for specifically who it is good for so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you you can understand exactly what the benefits are this kind of vague promise that it 's going to work no matter what but you get the statistics for how effective it is you 're walking into a possible side effect so i love this i love that drug facts box and so i was thinking about what 's an opportunity i could have to help people understand information what 's another latent and so i came up with this lab test results they go right to doctors and god forbid i think many doctors if you really asked them they don 't really understand all this stuff either this is the worst presented information and he would say yes this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible what we did at wired was we we went and i got our graphic design department to re imagine and this is the this is what we came up with the after takes what was four pages that previous slide was was actually the first of four pages of data that 's just the general blood work it goes on and on and on all these values all these numbers you don 't know this is our one page summary the things that might jump out at you from the then you can drill down and how actually we put your level in context and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls in this case this patient is is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level likewise you can go over your lipids and again understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the hdl and the ldl if you so choose but again always using color and personalized proximity to that we summarize and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate we give them some insight into what choices they can make what actions they can take so that 's our general blood work test in this case it 's a sin of omission they have this huge amount of space and they don 't use it for anything so we do now the crp test is often done following a cholesterol test or in conjunction with a cholesterol test so we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page the way the doctor is going to evaluate it so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well it 's a protein that shows up when your your blood vessels might be inflamed which might be a risk for heart disease what you 're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language we use the the person 's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks so we start to use the the the data we have to run a very simple calculation that 's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is and here 's the after now a lot of our effort on this one as many of you probably know a psa test is a very controversial test it 's used to test for prostate cancer but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged and so we we spent a good deal of our time indicating that 50s so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is in this case it 's about twenty five percent based on that and then again the follow up actions so our cost for this was less than why is wired magazine doing this quest diagnostics and labcorp the two largest lab testing companies they made profits of over seven hundred million dollars and over five hundred million dollars respectively we need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor should not be the insurance company it should be the patient it 's the person who actually in the end is going to be having having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors this is information that is incredibly powerful it 's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change but we 're not using it it 's just sitting there it 's being lost because i don 't actually expect people to start developing these and the only acceptable answer is audience and then what 's next how do i integrate this information into the longer course of my life ordinary people are capable of understanding this information if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form it 's giving them an opportunity to act that 's what engagement is and this information is out there thank you very much"
