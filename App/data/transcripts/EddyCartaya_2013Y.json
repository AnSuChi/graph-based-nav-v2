  "transcript": "okay a few of you when you think of a cave most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock and in fact that 's how most caves are around this half of the country most of your caves are made but the caves i want to share with you today are made completely of ice specifically glacier exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave now these days with so many people hiking around it 's pretty hard to find a new cave so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of oregon 's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before well those of you who have ever seen or touched snow you know that it 's really light because it 's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together and it 's mostly air it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice forming big networks of caves sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock now the crazy thing about glacier caves warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up gets into the cave and melts the ceilings back taller and taller weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving because it 's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that 's slowly sliding down the mountain now he and i have both been exploring caves a long time and we 've been climbing mountains a long time but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before back in two thousand and eleven brent saw a youtube video of a couple we had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole this is me looking into the entrance we followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three dimensional map of the cave on our way back out so how do you map a cave well cave maps aren 't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels to make a cave map you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations then now those of you taking trigonometry that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there in the more i mapped and studied caves the more useful i found all that math that i originally hated in school to be so when you 're done surveying you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this and we named this cave snow dragon cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow now later this summer as more snow melted off the glacier we found more caves and we realized they were all connected this cave was amazing the ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up and we couldn 't understand why this cave was so much colder than snow dragon until we got to the end and we found out why there was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going one hundred freezing everything inside of it following year so we could be the first ones to explore it there 's our camp on the left side of this entrance room brent named this cave pure imagination i think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined but there are some really cool things in there there 's weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice in fact this past summer scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor where we end up finding them for example this is a noble fir seed we found it 's been frozen in the ice for over one hundred years and it 's just now starting to sprout this mallard duck feather was found over one thousand eight hundred feet in the back of snow dragon cave this duck died on the surface of the glacier long ago and its feathers have finally made it down through over one hundred feet of ice before falling inside the cave hidden away just waiting to be found new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before so it 's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself you just have to be willing to look and go where people don 't often go thank you very much"
