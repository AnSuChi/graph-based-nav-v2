  "transcript": "to tell you about a legal case that i worked on involving a man named steve titus titus was a restaurant manager he was thirty one years he was engaged to gretchen about to be married she was the love of his life and one night the couple went out for a romantic you see titus ' car sort of resembled a car that was driven and titus kind of resembled that rapist so the police took a picture of titus they put it in a photo lineup they later showed it to the victim and she pointed to titus ' photo she said that one 's the closest and when steve titus was put on trial for rape the rape victim got on the stand and said absolutely positive that 's the man and and titus is taken away to jail so what would you do at this point well titus lost complete faith in the legal system he got the interest of an investigative journalist and that journalist actually found the real rapist and when this information was given to the judge and really that 's where this case should should have ended it should have been over titus should have thought of this as a horrible year a year of accusation and trial but over it didn 't end that way he 'd lost his job couldn 't get it back and that 's when i really started working on this case trying to figure out how did that victim go from that one 's the closest to i 'm absolutely positive that 's the guy well titus was consumed with his civil case he was thirty five years old i was asked to work on titus ' case and if i meet somebody on an airplane this happened on the way over to scotland if i meet somebody on an airplane and we ask each other what do you do what do you do and i say i study memory they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names or they 've got a relative who 's got alzheimer 's or some kind of memory problem but i have to tell them i don 't study i study false steve titus is not the only person to be convicted based on somebody 's false memory in one project in the united states information has been gathered on three hundred innocent people three hundred defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn 't do they three quarters of them are due to faulty memory faulty eyewitness well why many people believe that but decades of work in psychology has shown that this just isn 't true you can go in there and change it but i first started studying this constructive memory process in the i did my experiments that involved showing people simulated crimes and accidents and asking them questions about what they in one study we showed people a simulated accident and if we asked the leading smashed question and moreover that leading smashed question caused people to be more likely to tell us that they saw broken glass in the accident scene when there wasn 't any broken glass at all and you might be thinking well you know these are filmed events they are not particularly stressful would the same kind of mistakes be made with a really stressful event in a study we published just a few months ago we have an answer to this question because what was unusual about this study is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience the subjects in this study were members of the u s military who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise to teach them what it 's going to be like for them if they are ever captured as prisoners of war abusive fashion for thirty minutes and when we feed them suggestive information and so what these studies are showing is that when you feed people misinformation about some experience that that they may have had you can distort or contaminate or change we get misinformation not only if we 're questioned in a leading way but if we talk to other witnesses who might consciously or inadvertently feed us some erroneous information or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced all of these provide the opportunity for this kind of contamination of our memory we began to see an even more extreme kind of memory problem some patients were going into therapy with one problem maybe they had depression an eating disorder and they were coming out of therapy extreme memories for horrific brutalizations sometimes in satanic rituals sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements one woman came out of psychotherapy i was where do these bizarre memories come from and what i found is that most of these situations involved some particular form and so i asked were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy like the imagination exercises or dream interpretation or in some cases hypnosis or in some cases exposure to false information were these leading these patients to develop these very bizarre unlikely memories and i designed some experiments to try to study the processes that were being used in this psychotherapy so i could study the development of these very rich false we used suggestion a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases we used this kind of suggestion you were crying you were ultimately rescued by an elderly person and reunited with the family and we succeeded in planting this memory in the minds of but we and other investigators have planted rich false memories of things that researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid you nearly drowned and had to be rescued researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal researchers planted the false you witnessed demonic possession i do want to add that it might seem like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects in the name of science but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation by research ethics boards that have made the decision that the temporary discomfort that some of these subjects might experience in these studies is outweighed to my surprise when i published this work and began to speak out against this particular brand of psychotherapy it created some pretty bad problems for me and by the patients whom they had influenced i had sometimes armed guards at speeches that i was invited to give people trying to drum up letter writing campaigns to get me but probably the worst was i suspected that a woman was innocent of abuse that was being claimed by her grown daughter she accused her mother of sexual abuse based on a repressed memory and this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story to be filmed and presented in public places and so i started to investigate and eventually found information that convinced me that this mother was innocent i published an expos on the case and a little while later the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit and i went through nearly but finally finally it was over and i could really get back to my work in the process however i became part of a disturbing trend in america where scientists are being sued for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy does it have repercussions does it affect your later thoughts your later behaviors our first study planted a false memory that you got sick as a child eating certain foods hard boiled eggs dill pickles strawberry ice cream and we found that people didn 't want to eat the foods as much at an outdoor picnic necessarily bad or unpleasant if we planted a warm fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus we could get people to want to eat asparagus and so what these studies are showing is that you can plant false memories and they have repercussions that affect behavior long after along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues and should we ever ban its use therapists can 't ethically plant false memories in the mind of their patients even if it would help the patient but there 's nothing to stop a parent from trying this out on their and when i suggested this publicly it created an outcry again there she goes she 's advocating that parents lie to their children but maybe my work has made me different from most people most people cherish their memories know that they represent their identity who they are where they came from and i appreciate that i feel that way too but i know from my work how much fiction is already in there if i 've learned anything from these decades of working on these problems it 's this just because somebody tells you something and they say it with confidence just because they say it with lots of detail just because they express emotion when they say it it doesn 't mean that it really happened we can reliably distinguish true memories from false memories we need independent corroboration such a discovery has made me more tolerant such a discovery might have saved steve titus the man whose whole was snatched away by a false memory"
