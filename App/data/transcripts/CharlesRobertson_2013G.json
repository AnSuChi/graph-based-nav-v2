  "transcript": "life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade that means if an african child the battle against malaria is being won with deaths from malaria down according to the latest world bank data and malaria nets actually are playing a role in that but then the people that and you saw that get quicker and quicker among the reasons i think it 's happening right now is the quality of the leadership i think most of us would agree that the greatest politician in the world was african and the west is engaging with that the west has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved from about seventy percent of gdp down to about forty at politics gets weaker when debt is high when public sector debt is low governments don 't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe and again in the west we have private sector debt of two hundred percent of gdp in spain the u k and the u s that 's an awful lot of debt many african countries are sitting at ten to thirty percent of gdp if there 's any continent that can do what china has done china 's at about one hundred and thirty percent of gdp on that chart so they 've got great government finances great private sector debt does anyone recognize this in fact they do foreign direct investment has poured into africa in the last fifteen years back in the ' 70s and this investment is actually and they 're investing in energy africa produces ten million barrels a day of oil now it 's the same as saudi arabia shopping malls and this very encouraging story i think is partly and it 's not just about african demographics i 'm showing you the number of 15 to say you 're foxconn setting up an which is the bulk of that east asian blue line where there 's two hundred million young people and every year until two thousand and ten that 's getting bigger which means you 're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying give us a job and i don 't need a big pay rise just please give me a job now that 's completely changed now this decade we 're going to see a so where do you set up your new factory you look at south asia and people are they 're looking at pakistan and bangladesh and and they 're looking at africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade i think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic if you look at the red line here what you 're going to see is that in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education nobody else did they chose instead turkey and mexico because their education levels were twenty five to thirty percent today at the levels that turkey and mexico were at in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five they will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth so what 's africa looking like today this is how i look at africa it 's a bit odd because i 'm an economist each little box is about a billion dollars and you see that i pay an awful lot of attention to nigeria sitting there in the middle south africa is playing a role but when i 'm thinking about the future i 'm actually most interested strong democracies are the orange color and what you 'll see here is that most africans are now living in democracies why does that matter because what people want the battle between the two candidates was over education one guy offered free secondary school education to all he won by a margin which is helping growth through education it 's a positive virtuous circle asked this question and this particular question makes me quite sad it 's but what about corruption how can you invest in africa when there 's corruption and what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth and the countries on the right hand side you 'll see the per capita gdp basically every country with a per capita gdp of say less than five thousand dollars has got a corruption score of roughly what 's that about three every poor country is corrupt every rich country is relatively uncorrupt and the way now i don 't want to be an apologist for corruption i 've been arrested because i refused to pay a bribe now i 'm going to let you because the question really is what happens next and if you go back to the year two thousand what you 'll find is the economist had a very famous cover the hopeless continent and what they 'd done is they 'd looked at growth in africa over the previous ten years two percent and they said what 's going to happen in the next ten years they assumed two percent and that made it a pretty hopeless story because population growth was two and a half people got poorer in africa in the 1990s now two thousand and twelve the economist has a new cover and what does that new cover show that new cover shows well africa rising because the growth over the last ten years has been about five and a half percent because if growth for the last ten years has been five and a half percent what do you think the imf is forecasting for the next five years of growth in in africa very good i think you 're secretly saying to your head probably five and a half percent you 're all economists and i think like most economists offense what i like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what africa has already done and it means that jump from one thousand eight hundred years of nothing to whoof suddenly shooting through the roof india is one of those examples this is indian growth from one thousand nine hundred and sixty to two thousand and ten ignore the scale on the bottom for a second actually for the first twenty years the ' 60s and ' 70s india didn 't really grow it grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half if boom india began to explode it wasn 't a hindu rate of growth it 's remarkably similar i 'm saying developing asia is ten years india i can draw out some forecasts for the next thirty to forty years and that tells me this that africa is going to go from a $ two trillion economy today to a $ twenty nine trillion economy by now that 's bigger than europe and america put together life expectancy is going to go up by thirteen years the population 's going to double from one billion to two billion so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold lagos yes from the positives in asia but also the negatives perhaps africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made surely the technologies that we 're talking about here this surely some of these can perhaps help africa grow even faster and i think here we can play a role because technology does let you help you can go and download some of the great african literature from the internet now no not right now just thirty seconds you can go and buy some of the great tunes my ipod 's full of them buy african products go on holiday and see for yourself the change that 's happening invest and then you and i can help make sure that for africa the 21st century is their century thank you very much"
