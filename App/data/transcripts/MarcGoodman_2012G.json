  "transcript": "i study i sincerely i 've spent a career in law enforcement i 've had to see more than my fair share of violence and the darker underbelly of society and 's informed my opinions and i 'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you today i 'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at the ones but in the hands of suicide bombers the future can look quite different i started observing technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer in those days this was the height of technology though you will all the drug dealers and gang members with whom i dealt had one of these long before any police officer i knew did they have a national encrypted radio communications system think about that think about the innovation that went into that think about the infrastructure to build it why can 't i get a cell phone signal in san francisco how is this possible it makes no sense we consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do the men that carried that attack out were armed they threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes but heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations guns and bombs are nothing new what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them they were armed with mobile phones we 've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news this is an operations center and the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in pakistan where they monitored the bbc al jazeera cnn and indian local stations they also monitored the internet and social media they did all of this in real time the innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government they used it to great effect at one point during the 60 hour siege the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed and they are you and what are you doing here and the man replied i 'm just an innocent schoolteacher of course the terrorists knew they picked up his identification and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room where the terrorist war room googled him and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said your hostage is he heavyset does he wear glasses and after discovering this information the terrorist war room all worry about our privacy settings on facebook but the fact of the matter is our openness can be used against us terrorists are doing this a search engine can determine who shall live and who shall die this is the world that we live in during the mumbai siege terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand three hundred people were gravely wounded and over one hundred and ten but with technology were able to bring a city of twenty million people and this traveled around the world this this is what radicals can do with openness what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have and it 's scaling for good and it 's scaling for evil you can now commit more crime as well in the old days it was a knife and a gun then criminals moved to robbing trains you could rob two hundred people on a train a great innovation moving forward the internet allowed things to scale even more in fact many of you will remember the recent sony playstation hack think about that when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob one hundred million of course it 's not just about stealing things there are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit many of you will remember this super cute video from the last ted quadcopters can be loaded with firearms and automatic weapons are cute when they play music to you when they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you a little bit less so recently the fbi arrested an al qaeda affiliate in the united states who was planning on using every time a new technology is being introduced criminals are there to exploit it we 've all seen 3d printers we know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and but i wonder to myself for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up how might they use if you can print in metal you can print one of these and in fact you can also print one of these too the uk i know has some very strict firearms every day we 're connecting more and more of our lives to the internet which means that the internet of things will soon be because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities criminals understand this terrorists understand if you control the code you control the world this is the future that awaits us there has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn 't been hacked that 's troubling since the human body itself every year thousands thousands of cochlear implants diabetic pumps pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people in the united states there are sixty thousand people who have a pacemaker that connects to the internet it 's not a good thing of course we 're going to go even deeper than the human body but there 's another operating system out there the original operating system dna it 's a great challenge for them there are people already working on hacking the software of life and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all some won 't be well with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things for example i predict that we will move away from a narcotics world why do you need the plants anymore you can just take the dna code from marijuana or poppies or coca leaves and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast and you can take those yeast and make them make the cocaine for you or the marijuana or any other drug so how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting in fact we may have some really interesting bread and beer as we go into this next century it was proceeding at moore 's law pace but then in two thousand and eight something changed the technologies got better and now dna sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of moore 's law that has significant implications for us but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly and knowing criminals and terrorists as i do we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future it will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax weaponized flu we recently saw a case where some researchers made the avian influenza virus more potent it already has a seventy percent mortality rate if you get it but it 's hard to get engineers by moving around a small number of genetic changes were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch so that not thousands of people would die you see you can go ahead and create new pandemics and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody but it goes deeper than that dna researcher andrew hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments modern cancer treatments to go after one one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact then you can also go after any one person 's cell personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons which means you can attack any one individual including all the people in this picture what to do i will be tweeting out the answer later on today laughter but i know a few things in the wake of nine the best security minds put together all their innovation and this is what they created if you 're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse while the threat is international big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we 're moving so how might we prepare for some of these specific threats like attacking a president or a prime minister this would be the natural government response to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future what happens if we were to take the president 's dna or a king or queen 's and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that dna and do penetration testing against it as a of helping our leaders or what if we sent it out to a few thousand what happens if we just gave it to the whole public then we could all be engaged in helping the organized crime and corruption reporting project is staffed by journalists and citizens dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world and in a more dramatic case we 've seen in mexico a country that has been racked by fifty thousand murders in the past six years they 're killing so many people they can 't even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of ciudad juarez what can we do about this the government has proven ineffective so in whether or not you realize it we are at the dawn of a technological arms race an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill the threat is serious and the time to prepare for it is now i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are my personal belief is that rather than having a small elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all we 're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can if we all do our part i think we 'll be in a much better space it 's up to all of us this was a technology i would frequently deploy as a police officer it doesn 't scale it doesn 't work globally and it surely doesn 't work virtually they call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement thank you"
