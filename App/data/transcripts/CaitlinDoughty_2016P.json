  "transcript": "i would like for my body to be laid out to be eaten by animals having your body laid out to be eaten by animals is not for but it 's not without precedent it 's call in fact it 's likely happening right now as we speak in the mountainous regions of tibet they practice sky burial a ritual where the body is left to be consumed by vultures in mumbai in india those who follow the parsi religion put their dead in structures called towers of silence but followed by am a recent vegetarian which means i spent the first thirty years or so of my life frantically inhaling should they not have their turn with me am i not an animal biologically speaking are we not all in this room animals it means just like any other creature on earth for the last nine years i 've worked in the funeral industry first as a crematory operator then as a mortician and most recently as the owner of my own funeral home and i have some good news if you 're looking to avoid the whole doomed to decay and die you will have all the help in the world in that avoidance from the funeral industry whether they mean to or not the funeral industry promotes this idea of human exceptionalism it doesn 't matter what it takes how much it costs how bad it is for the environment we 're going to do it because humans are worth it it ignores the fact that death can be an emotionally messy and complex affair and that there is beauty in decay beauty in the natural return to the earth from whence we came but with a dead body the funeral industry will protect your dead body by offering to sell your family a casket made of hardwood or metal with a rubber sealant we 're wasting all of these resources concretes metal hardwoods hiding them in vast vast underground fortresses when you choose burial at the cemetery your dead body is not coming anywhere near the dirt that surrounds it food for worms you are not next the industry will sanitize your body through embalming but the doctors in this room will tell you that that claim would only apply if the person had died of some wildly infectious disease like the bacteria that causes disease the industry will beautify the corpse they 'll tell you that the natural dead body of your mother or father is not good enough as it they 'll inject dyes so the person looks a little more alive just resting if this system of beautification sanitation protection there is a whole wave of people funeral directors designers environmentalists trying to come up with a more way of death for these people death is not necessarily a pristine makeup powder blue tuxedo there 's no question that our current methods of death are not particularly sustainable what with the waste of resources and our reliance on chemicals which is usually considered the environmentally friendly option uses per cremation the natural gas equivalent of a last summer i was in the i was at western carolina university at their body farm more accurately called a human decomposition facility bodies donated to science are brought here and their decay is studied to benefit the future of on this particular day there were twelve bodies laid out in various stages of decomposition some were one was wearing purple pajamas one still had blonde facial hair visible the forensic aspect is really fascinating but not actually why i was there i was there because a colleague of mine named katrina spade is attempting to create a system not of cremating the dead she calls the system she imagines a facility where the family could come and lay their dead loved one in a mixture that would in four to six weeks reduce the body bones and all to in those four to six weeks your molecules become other molecules you literally transform how would this fit in with the very recent desire a lot of people seem to have to be buried under a tree or to become a tree when they die chalky layer but if you 're recomposed if you actually become the soil you can nourish the tree and become the post mortem contributor you 've always wanted to be that you deserve to be there are a lot of people who think we shouldn 't even have cemeteries anymore because we 're running it can 't be developed on post mortem hell no i won 't go no really i can 't i 'm decomposing under here any money that the family gives to the cemetery would go back into protecting and managing the land there are no headstones and no graves in the typical sense there 's no embalming no heavy metal caskets my funeral home sells a few caskets made out of things like woven willow and though only native plants to the area are allowed there 's hope in conservation places for classes and events places where nature and mourning meet once again a chance to just decompose in a hole in the ground i think for a lot of people they 're starting to get the sense that our current funeral industry isn 't really working for them for many of us it doesn 't reflect what we stood for during our lives if we can die in a way that is more humble and thank you"
