  "transcript": "coca cola tins on top of everest and a buddhist monk in monterey and so i just came two days ago from the himalayas for a while to the himalayas themselves and to show the place where and found their way to the mountains so these are a few images i was lucky to to take and be there there 's mount kailash in eastern tibet wonderful this is from marlboro country this is a turquoise lake a meditator this is the hottest day of the year somewhere in eastern tibet on we camped and my tibetan friends said happiness is not at all interesting i just wrote an essay on happiness and there was a controversy and someone wrote an article saying don 't impose on us the dirty work of happiness we like our suffering because it 's so good when it ceases for a while this is what i see from the balcony of my hermitage in the himalayas it 's about two meters by three and you are all welcome any time now let 's come to happiness it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking may i suffer the whole day consciously or not directly or whatever we hope whatever we dream somehow is related to a even the one who hangs himself somehow is looking for cessation of suffering he you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness some people only believed in remembering the past imagining the future never the present some people say happiness is right now it 's the quality of the freshness of the present moment and that led henri bergson the french philosopher to say all the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague so that each of them could define their own terms that would be fine if it was just a secondary but now if it is something that is going to determine although we seek happiness it seems we turn although we want to avoid suffering it seems we are running somewhat towards it and that can also come from some kind of confusions one of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure but if you look at the it is something that changes of nature beautiful chocolate cake first serving is delicious second one not so much then we feel disgust we get tired i used to be a fan of bach i used to play it on the guitar you know i can hear it two three five times if i had to hear it very cold you come near a fire it 's so wonderful after some moments you just go a little back and then it starts burning it sort of uses itself and also again it can also it 's something that you it is not something that is radiating outside you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot so let 's say well being and so i think the best definition according to the buddhist view is that well being is not just a mere a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states and all the joys and sorrows that can come one 's way for you that might be surprising can we have this kind of well being while being sad in a way not because we are speaking of a different level look at the waves coming near the shore you hit the bottom now if you look at the but the depth even joy but there 's also wicked joy we think that if we could gather this and that all the conditions something that we say everything to be happy to have everything to be happy that very sentence already reveals the doom but our control of the outer world is limited we know by experience that we can be what we call a little paradise and yet be completely unhappy within and there was a lot of construction going so one evening he said look you are doing all these things but isn 't it nice also to build something within and he said [ without ] that even if you get a high tech flat on the 100th floor of a if you are deeply unhappy within all you are going to look for is a window from which to jump we know a lot of people who in very difficult circumstances manage to keep the outer conditions do influence healthier to have access to information education to be able to travel to have freedom help and which are those which will undermine there are some which are adverse to this well being and so if we look from our own experience anger strong grasping so we may consider like a chain reaction the more we feel miserable we feel tormented at the opposite without anyone knowing anything about it we could save we don 't need any gratitude just the mere fact of doing that and we would like to be like that all the time to transform one 's mind aren 't those inherent to the nature of mind is change possible in our emotions in our traits in our moods and if we look from the point of view there is a primary quality of consciousness that 's just the mere fact to be cognitive to be aware consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it you can have ugly faces beautiful faces in the mirror the mirror allows that but the mirror is not tainted is not modified is not altered by those images likewise behind every single thought there is it cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then if it was always there like like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth then it would be found all the time somewhere we know we 're not always angry always jealous always generous so because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting that is the ground for mind training mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time you could go from love the same person want to harm and want to do good so there are natural antidotes to a kind of sense of inner freedom benevolence loving kindness against hatred but each emotion then would need a particular antidote and that 's by looking at the very nature hatred or each time it goes to the object it reinforces that obsession or that look at anger itself it looks very menacing like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm it will vanish like frost under the morning sun the propensity the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it although it may rise it will just cross the mind like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track it takes time because it took time for all those faults in our mind which is more in adequation with reality with interdependence with the continuous transformation which our being and our consciousness is so the interface with cognitive science since we need to come to that it was i suppose the subject of we have to deal in such a short time with brain plasticity the brain was thought to be more or less fixed all the nominal connections in numbers and quantities were thought until the last twenty years to be more or less fixed when we reached now recently it has been found that it can change a lot who has done ten thousand hours of violin practice some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain so can we do that with human qualities with loving kindness with patience with openness so that 's what those great meditators have been doing some of them who came to the labs like in madison wisconsin or they are real olympic champions of mind training fifty six electrodes same thing the scientific embargo if it 's ever submitted to nature hopefully it will to put their mind in a state where there 's nothing but loving kindness total availability to sentient being here is the preliminary result which i can show because it 's already been shown the bell curve shows one hundred and fifty controls and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe in very short people who have more activity in the right side they don 't describe a lot of positive affect it 's the opposite on the it can be changed if you see a comic movie you go off to the left side if you are happy about something you 'll go more to the left side if you have a bout of depression you 'll go to the right side full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion it 's something that is totally out of the bell curve hopefully they will come but they found that this is after three and a half hours in shown in other labs for instance paul ekman 's labs in in berkeley some meditators are able also to control their emotional response more than it could be thought like the startle experiments for example if you sit a guy on a chair with all this apparatus measuring your physiology and there 's kind of a bomb that goes off it 's response that in twenty years they never saw anyone who who would not jump they are able not to move at all so the whole point of that is not sort of to make like a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump or whatever more to say that mind training matters that this is not just this is something that 's going to determine the quality of every instant of our lives we are ready to spend fifteen years achieving education we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most the way our mind functions which again is the ultimate compassion is supposed we try to do in different places just this one example is worth a lot of work this lady with bone tb left alone in a tent was going to die with her only daughter one year later how she is different schools and clinics we 've been doing in tibet and just i leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than i could ever say and jumping monks of tibet"
