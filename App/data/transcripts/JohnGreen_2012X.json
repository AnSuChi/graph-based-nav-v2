  "transcript": "this is a map of new york state that was made in one thousand nine hundred and thirty seven by the general drafting company it 's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds because down here at the bottom of the catskill mountains there is a little town called roscoe actually this will go easier if i just put it up here there 's roscoe and then right above that is the tiny town of agloe new york agloe new york is very famous to cartographers because it 's a paper town it 's also mapmakers because my map of new york and your map of new york are going to look very similar on account of the shape of new york often mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps in order to protect their copyright because then if my fake place shows up on your map i can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map ernest on it at the same exact intersection of two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere well you can imagine the delight over at general drafting and they say we 've caught you we made agloe new york up it is a fake place it 's a paper town we 're going to sue your pants because people kept going to that intersection of two dirt roads expecting there to be a place called agloe someone built a place called agloe new york it had a gas station a general store two houses at its peak and this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist because we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world in which we 're actually living which is why my third book is called paper towns but what interests me ultimately more it 's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world right like the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps but what i find a lot more interesting is the way that the manner in which we map the world changes the world because the world would truly be a different place if north were down and the world would be a truly different place if alaska and russia weren 't on opposite sides of the map and the world would be a different place if we projected europe to show it in its actual size the world is changed by our maps of the world the way that we choose i believe that what we map changes the life i do believe that while maps don 't show you where you will go in your life so i was a really terrible student when i was a kid was consistently in the low 2s and i think the reason that i was such a terrible student is that i felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me and i had to jump over and i didn 't really want to jump over these hurdles because they seemed completely arbitrary so i often wouldn 't and then people would threaten me you know they 'd threaten me with this going on [ my ] permanent record as far as i could tell at eleven or twelve years old like people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning and the men who had good jobs one of the first things they did was tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks they literally put nooses on themselves and then they went off to their jobs whatever they were that 's not a recipe for a happy life these people in my twelve year old imagination these people who are strangling themselves and then when i was in tenth grade i went to this school indian springs school a small boarding school outside of birmingham alabama i found myself surrounded by people who celebrated oh so cool disengagement wasn 't clever or funny but like it was a simple and unspectacular response to very complicated and compelling and i learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears i learned that the civil war was a nationalizing conflict i learned some physics i learned that correlation shouldn 't be confused with causation all of these things by the way and it 's true that i don 't use most of them for my job it 's about cartography what is the process of cartography it 's you know sailing upon some land and thinking i think i 'll draw that bit of land and then wondering maybe there 's some more land to draw and i was very fortunate to have those but a lot of the learning that i did in high school wasn 't about it was about what happened outside of the classroom for instance i can tell you that there 's a certain slant of light winter afternoons that oppresses like the heft of cathedral tunes not because i memorized emily dickinson in school when i was in high school the reason i can tell you what opportunity cost is is because one day when i was playing super mario kart on my couch my friend emmet walked in and he said how long have you been playing super mario kart and i said have made thirty dollars so in some ways you just paid thirty dollars to play super mario kart and i was like i 'll take that deal but i learned what opportunity cost is and along the way the map of my life got better it got bigger it contained more places there were more things that might happen more futures i might have you know cantor 's idea that some infinite infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets but i didn 't really understand the calculus and then i went to another when i started working at a magazine called booklist where i was an assistant and then i wrote a book and like all authors dream of doing i promptly quit my job i hated it i read many many books during this two year period i read books about stalin and books about how the uzbek people came to identify as muslims and i read books about how to make atomic bombs instead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners a community of people and then in two thousand and six i met that guy his ze frank was running at the time a show called the show with ze frank and that was my way back into being a community learner again here 's ze talking about las vegas ze frank las vegas was built in the middle of a huge hot desert almost everything here was brought from somewhere else the sort of rocks the trees the waterfalls these fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew contrasted here there 's no reason to feel like you 're missing anything this new york means the same to me as it does to everyone else everything is out of context and that means context allows for everything self parking events center shark reef this fabrication but unlike most mirrors which present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place these mirrors come back empty john green makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see the pixels in online video just a great public intellectual he 's also a brilliant community builder and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners so we played ze frank at chess collaboratively and we beat him we organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the united states we turned the earth into a sandwich by having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the earth and on the exact opposite point of the earth have another person holding a piece of bread and that was what was so exciting to me and if you go online you can find communities like this all over the place follow the calculus tag on tumblr and yes you will see people complaining about calculus but you 'll also see people re blogging those complaints making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful and here 's a way in to thinking about the problem ask a historian or ask science where you can ask people who are in these fields a wide range of questions from very serious ones to very silly ones but to me the most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the internet right now are on youtube and i am biased but i think in a lot of ways the youtube page resembles a classroom look for instance at minute physics a guy who 's teaching the world about physics let 's cut to the the higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally the higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere permeating higgs field the higgs field in turn but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the 1980s in the equations the higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force that until now we 've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence jg or here 's a video that i made as part of my show crash course talking about world war i the immediate cause was of course the assassination in sarajevo of the austrian archduke franz ferdinand on june twenty eight one thousand nine hundred and fourteen by a bosnian serb nationalist named gavrilo princip quick aside it 's worth noting that the first big war of the twentieth century began with an act of terrorism so franz ferdinand wasn 't particularly well liked by his uncle the emperor franz joseph now that is a mustache but even so the assassination led austria to issue an ultimatum to serbia whereupon serbia accepted some but not all of austria 's demands leading austria to declare war against serbia and then russia due to its alliance with the serbs mobilized its army germany because it had an alliance with austria told russia to stop mobilizing which russia failed to do so then germany mobilized its own army france and it 's not just physics and world history that people are choosing to learn through youtube here 's a video about abstract mathematics but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway so i guess that 's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum so in a quite understandable need for distraction you 're doodling and thinking more about what the plural of series should be than about the topic at hand dog sized elephant puppy sized elephant all the way down to mr tusks and beyond which is at least a tiny bit awesome because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line and still have it fit across a single notebook page lastly here 's destin from smarter every day talking about the conservation of angular momentum and since it 's youtube cats hey today 's question is why like most simple questions there 's a very complex answer for instance let me reword this question how does a cat go from frame without violating the conservation of angular momentum jg so here 's something all four of these videos have in common they all have more than half a million views on youtube but because they are part of the communities of learning that are being set up by these and i know that youtube comments have a very very bad reputation in the world of the internet but in fact if you go on comments for these channels what you 'll find is people engaging the subject and because the youtube page is set up so that the page in which i 'm talking to you is on the exact the place where i 'm talking to you is on the exact same page as your comments you are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation i get to participate with you and you find this whether it 's world history or mathematics or science or whatever it is you also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes and other internet conventions you know got bored invented calculus or and then again when i was in college and as an adult these communities has me to a community of learners and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood so that i no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young vi hart and minute physics introduced me to all kinds of things that i and i know that we all hearken back to the days of the parisian salon in the enlightenment or to the algonquin round table and wish oh i wish i could have been a part of that i wish i could have laughed at dorothy parker 's jokes but i 'm here to tell you that these places exist they still exist they exist in corners of the internet where old men fear to tread and i truly truly believe that when we invented agloe new york"
