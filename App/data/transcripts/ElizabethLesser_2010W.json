  "transcript": "this room may appear to be holding six hundred people but there 's actually so many more because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities i have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since i was a little girl i call them the mystic and the warrior i was born into a family of politically active intellectual atheists there was this equation in my family that went something like this if you are intelligent you therefore are not spiritual i was the freak of the family i was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses i wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear gurus from the east started washing up on the shores of america and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them trying to peer beyond what so what did he mean by this i 'll show you take a breath right now of this clear air in this room coral it 's actually a person and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now all around us imagine what we 're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels my years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions they 've made me a proud she 's she 's she working on political campaigns and it can be sort i 've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic people like martin luther king jr who wrote i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be this he wrote is the interrelated structure of reality another mystic warrior who said the problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small and nelson mandela who lives by the african concept of ubuntu which means i need you in order to be me and you need me in order to be you now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if and we need to do their work now i 'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are by the voice we 're giving to the most divisive among us listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the u s liberalism is a mental disorder rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot now here 's a title that may sound familiar but whose author may surprise you of struggle against lies stupidity and who wrote that that was adolf hitler 's first title for mein kampf my struggle the book that launched the nazi party the worst eras in human history whether in cambodia or germany or rwanda they start like this with negative and it 's it 's to help all of us myself included to counteract i realize we 're all busy people so don 't worry you can do this on a lunch break i 'm calling my initiative take the other to lunch if you are a republican or if you 're now if the idea of taking any i suggest you start more local because there is no shortage of the other maybe that person who worships at the mosque or the church or the synagogue down the street someone from the other side of the abortion anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you or i took a conservative now on paper she passed my smoking ears test and i 'm an activist from the left so first of all decide on a goal to get to know one person from a group you may agree on some ground rules my tea party lunchmate and i came up with these be curious be conversational be and listen share some of your life experiences with me and what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side my lunch partner and i came away with some really important insights and i 'm going to share just one with you i think it has relevance to any problem between people i asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know and since we had established some trust we believed in each other 's sincerity we agreed we 'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite by the end of our lunch we acknowledged each other 's openness neither of us had tried to change the other but we also hadn 't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch past our knee jerk reactions to the ubuntu place which is the only place where solutions to our most problems will be found next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing that will be your clue and it 's difficult it 's two people dropping the pretense of being people two warriors dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other here 's how the great persian poet rumi put it"
