  "transcript": "so i 'm here to tell you a story of success from africa a year and a half ago were ted fellows a year ago in kenya and in that time we prototyped and built in about three days a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them the default device the mobile phone as our common denominator and went from there we got reports like this this is just a couple of them from january 17th last year it was but then we decided we needed to do something more we needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world and so there is a team of developers from all over africa who are part of this team now from ghana from malawi from kenya there is even some from the u s we 're building for smartphones so that it can be used in the developed world as well as the developing world and so we we build it in africa first and then we move to the edges small ngos doing their own little projects but that 's actually not what i 'm here to talk about i 'm here to talk about the next big thing because what we 're finding out is that we have this capacity to report eyewitness accounts of what 's going on in real time we 're seeing this in what is the veracity level of what you 're looking at so what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to to to actually do anything with right now how do we deal with that information that is coming in you can 't understand and trying to figure out what is going on but they don 't know"
