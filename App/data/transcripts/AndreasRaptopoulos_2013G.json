  "transcript": "billion people in the world today do not have access to all season roads one billion people one seventh of the earth 's population they cannot get critical supplies they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income in sub saharan africa for instance eighty five percent of roads are unusable in the wet season it 's estimated it 's going to take them fifty years to catch up congested can there be a better way can we create a system using today 's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they 've done with mobile telephones in the last ten years many of those nations and someone would get the request immediately that 's we believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this this can transport a small payload today about two kilograms over a short distance about ten kilometers but it 's part we use three key technologies the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles the second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and let 's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail first of all compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world or even being stuck in traffic so they use gps and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations they dock swap a battery automatically and go out again they secure the most vulnerable part of the mission which is the landing eventually they 're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network it monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system i want to show you what one of those flights looks like here we are flying we 're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the two thousand and ten earthquake people there love this and i want to show you costs are coming down very rapidly imagine if your life depended on this package somewhere in africa or in new york city after sandy well it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over ten kilometers with this vehicle is just and we 're just at the beginning of this when we saw this we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world so okay how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world and we looked at setting up a network in lesotho for transportation of hiv aids samples the problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they 're being collected and we said what if we wanted to cover compare this to normal infrastructure investments we think this can be this is the power of a new paradigm there must be other uses for it it can be used perhaps in other places in the world so let 's look at the other end of the spectrum so we think it makes sense in those places to we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation it 's ultimately scalable with a very operating in the background so when we started this a couple of years ago now and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon and of course we 're talking about drones right a technology that 's not only unpopular in the west but one that has become a very very unpleasant fact of life for we chose to do this one imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines reach them with better medication it would give us an unfair advantage against battling hiv aids tuberculosis we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions lifting millions of people out of poverty we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable so for those that still believe that this is science fiction i firmly say to you that it is not"
