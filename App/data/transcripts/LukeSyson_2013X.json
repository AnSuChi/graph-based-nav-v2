  "transcript": "it looks like this this is also another default selection leonardo da vinci 's exquisitely soulful image of the lady with an ermine and i use that word soulful deliberately or then there 's this or rather these the two versions of leonardo 's virgin of the rocks that were about to come together in london for the very first time in the exhibition that i was then in the absolute throes of organizing i was literally up to my eyes in leonardo and i had been for three years during that three years about what a picture can do about taking you from your own material world into a spiritual world he said actually that he believed the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible and invisible in the universe that 's a huge a huge task and yet somehow he achieves it he shows us i think the human soul he shows us the capacity of of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm to see so this in a sense was really what i believed an icon was at director here of the metropolitan museum about what my next move might be the move in fact back to an earlier life one i 'd begun at the british museum back to the world of three dimensions of sculpture and of decorative arts to take over the department of european sculpture and decorative arts but it was an incredibly busy time all the conversations were done at very peculiar times of the day over the phone so it was just before the time that the leonardo show was due to open when i finally made it back to the met to new york to see my new domain i better fifty seven of these galleries like fifty seven varieties of baked beans i believe and then i moved gradually around feeling a little lost sometimes my head also still full of the leonardo exhibition that was about to open and i came across and i thought to myself what the hell have i done there was absolutely no connection in my mind all and in fact if there was any emotion going on it was a kind of of repulsion this object felt utterly and completely alien silly at a level that i hadn 't yet understood silliness to be and then it was made worse there were two of them i started thinking about why it was in fact that i so vulgar you know so nouveau riche frankly and then there 's little pretty sprigs of flowers everywhere it 's such an extraordinarily artificial color i mean it 's a color that i can 't think of anything that you actually see in nature that looks that that shade the object even has its own tutu this little flouncy spangly bottomy bit that sits at the bottom of the reminded me in an odd kind of way of my niece 's fifth birthday party where all the little girls would come either as a princess or a fairy there was one who would come as a fairy princess you should have seen the looks and i realize that this object was in my mind born from the same mind from the same womb practically as barbie ballerina and then there 's the elephants those extraordinary elephants with their little sort of strange sinister expressions and greta garbo eyelashes with these golden tusks and so on i realized this was an elephant that had absolutely nothing to do with a majestic march across the serengeti it was a a dumbo nightmare but something more profound was happening as well 18th century the label had told me that these pieces were made by but for me they summed up a kind of i and my colleagues had always thank god there was a revolution there was a sort of idea really that if you owned a vase like this then there was really only one fate possible so there i was in i took the job and i went on looking at these vases i sort of had to because they 're on a through route they had this kind of where i couldn 't stop looking i started thinking well what are we what i started with was was understanding this as really it has these kinds of sculptural ingredients and then the play between actually really quite carefully disposed color and gilding and the sculptural surface is really not just one but two so he 's having to arrive at two exactly matched vases of this and then this question of uselessness well actually the end of the trunks were originally candle holders so what you would have had were candles it would have glittered in an interior a little like a little firework somebody reminded me that that word ' fancy ' which in ' fantasy ' in its own way as a leonardo da vinci painting is a portal to somewhere else this is opium induced visions of pink elephants then at that point this object starts to make sense this is an object which is all about escapism it 's about an escapism that that happens that the aristocracy in france sought very deliberately to distinguish themselves from ordinary people of the imagination"
