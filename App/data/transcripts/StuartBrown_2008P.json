  "transcript": "17th sunday magazine about play at the bottom of this it says it 's deeper than gender seriously but dangerously fun and a sandbox for new ideas about evolution except if you look at that cover what 's missing this is a courtyard in europe and a mixture of one hundred and there it is and i think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then i think we may have lost something in our so i 'm gonna take you through north of churchill manitoba in october and november there 's no ice on hudson bay and this polar bear that you see male he 's wild and fairly hungry and norbert rosing a german photographer is there on scene making a series of photos of these huskies who are tethered any of you who 've been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you there is a fixed but on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky wagging her and something very unusual happens that fixed behavior and this polar bear stands over the husky no claws extended no fangs taking a look and they begin an incredible ballet and if you 'll begin to look closely at the husky that 's bearing her throat to the polar bear and look a little more closely state and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that 's within all of us now how did i get john mentioned that i 've done some work with murderers and i have the texas tower murderer opened my eyes in retrospect when we studied his tragic mass murder to the importance of play in that that individual by deep study was found to have severe play deprivation charles whitman was his name and our committee which consisted of a lot of hard scientists did feel at end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the to the tragedy that he perpetrated and that finding has stood the test of time unfortunately even into more recent times at virginia tech and other studies of populations at risk but i didn 't really understand what it was and it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before i really began to to recognize that by any means but there are ways of looking at it that i think can give you give us all a taxonomy a way of and the infant 's old enough to have a social smile if we 've got them wired up with the right so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we 're beginning to get a handle on and so now i 'm going to take you through sort of a way of at play but it 's never just singularly which is a spontaneous desire to to this is a mountain goat if you 're having a bad day try this jump up and down wiggle around you 're going to feel better if its purpose is more important and this japanese macaque has made a snowball and he or she and they don 't throw it at each other but this is a fundamental part of being playful the human hand in manipulation of objects is the hand in search of a brain the brain is in search of a hand and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way jpl frank wilson and nate johnson who he taught and he tried to figure out why and he came to the conclusion quite on his own that the students who could no longer solve problems such as fixing cars before they will hire a research and development problem solver even if they 're summa cum laude from so very important now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration but it has to be safe exploration this happens to be ok he 's an anatomically interested little boy and that 's his mom other situations wouldn 't be quite so good but curiosity if you want to belong you need social play balletic movements curvilinear movements all specific to play and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts cognitive emotional and physical that come as a part of rough and tumble play ritual play we 're involved in some of that those of you who are from boston know that this was the moment where the red sox won the world series i love this picture because but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination her ability to spin yarns at this age preschool a really important part of being a player is imaginative the unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story i 'm telling you a story today about play bushman i think is talking about the fish that got away that was that long but it well a lot we don 't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play i walked into the carnegie asking for a grant they 'd given me a large grant when i was an academician and i thought i had a pretty good track record and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play it was obvious that they were not did not feel that play was serious i think that that 's a few years back i think that wave is past and the play wave is cresting there is some good science nothing lights up the brain like play three dimensional play fires up the cerebellum puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe the executive portion helps contextual memory be developed and and and and so it 's for me its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that 's associated with play and to bring together people who and that 's part of what the national institute for play is all about and this is one of the ways you can study play is to get a but it allows mobility which has limited the actual study of play and we 've got a mother infant play scenario that we 're hoping to to complete underway at the moment the reason i put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does the animal world has objectified it in the animal world if you take rats who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years if you stop that behavior on one odor saturated collar hardwired to flee and hide pretty smart they both hide out the non players never come out the players slowly explore the environment and begin again to test things out that says to me at least in rats and i think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture this is a consequence of play deprivation laughter this took a long time i had to get homer down and put him through the fmri and the spect and and we do know that domestic animals and others when they 're play deprived they don 't and rats also they don 't develop a brain that is normal now the program says that the opposite of play is not work and i think if you think about life without play no humor no flirtation no movies no games fantasy and and and try and imagine a culture or a life adult or otherwise and the thing that 's so unique about our species nobody misses that dog i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago what 's going to follow from that behavior culturally and otherwise as adults so part of the signaling system of play gestural you know you can tell and i think when we 're getting into collective play its really important for groups but it should be your biological first name and last name and we are by physical anthropologists by many many studies the most neotenous the most youthful the most flexible the most and this gives us a leg up on adaptability of looking at play that i also want to emphasize here which is the play history your own personal play history is unique this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll kevin carroll came from had to take care of a younger brother found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined and so he followed up on it and his life the transformation of his life from from deprivation and what one would expect potentially prison or death and he gives play as a as a transformative force over his entire life now there 's another play history that i think is a work in progress during the term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person at least in public and looking at his history which is is common in the press it seems to me at least looking at it from a shrink 's point of view that a lot of his life summers were hard hard work in the heat of tennessee summers he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington d c and although i think he certainly had the capacity for play because i do know something about that i think as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive which i think has its basis in all of us in our play history so what i would encourage on an individual level to do is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear joyful playful image that you have whether it 's with a toy on a birthday or on a and begin to build to build from the emotion of that and you 'll find you may change jobs which has happened to a number people when i 've had them do this in order to be more empowered through their play or you 'll be able to enrich your life by by prioritizing and paying attention to it thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment which is kind of like the polar bear husky state and its importance to creative thinking development and its biological basis to apply those principles through design thinking to promote innovation in the corporate world and the students will work with real world partners on design projects with widespread application this is our maiden voyage in this we 're about two and a half three months into it and it 's really been fun there is our star pupil this labrador who taught a lot of us what a state of play rich crandall and on the far right is i think a person who will be in cahoots with george smoot for a nobel prize stuart thompson in neuroscience so we 've had brendan who 's from ideo and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into and one of their projects was to so what will follow is a student made film about just characterized by a feeling of energized focus full involvement and success in the process of the activity an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in attendees at meetings don 't know when they 'll get back to the task that they left at their desk but it doesn 't have to be that way because when you need it again the meeting is literally hanging in the wearable meeting but when you take it off that 's when the real action happens where you set aside time to play but where your life becomes infused minute by minute hour by hour with body thank you john hockenberry it sounds to me like what you 're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go i think i 've heard this in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play the way animals and humans deal with play is that it 's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully i don 't think that 's accurate and i think probably because animals have taught us that if you stop a cat from playing which you can do and we 've all seen how cats bat around stuff they 're just as good predators 't played and if you imagine a kid pretending to be king kong or a race car there 's a disconnect between and this is where my chasing animals for four five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what i am now play has a biological place just like sleep and dreams do and if you look at sleep and dreams biologically the next step of evolution in mammals creatures with divinely superfluous neurons and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain so it 's not just something you do in your spare time jh how do you keep and i know you 're part of the scientific research community and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else how do you prevent and some of the data that you 've produced the good science that you 're talking about you 've produced is hot to handle how do you prevent either the media 's interpretation of your work or the scientific community 's well let 's round these kids up put them in pens and make them play for months at a time they 'll all be geniuses and go to harvard how do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you 're developing sb well i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that that i have who go from practitioners who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever so people know that it 's there and then you get an fmri specialist and you get frank wilson and you get and you get them into a group together focused on play pretty hard not to unfortunately that hasn 't been done sufficiently for the national science foundation national institute of mental health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously i mean you don 't hear about and yet i see it as something that 's just as basic for survival long term as learning some of the basic things about public health"
