  "transcript": "i work with really amazing little itty bitty creatures called cells and let me tell you what it 's like to grow these cells in the lab i work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment we plate them into dishes that we and we feed them sterilely of course with what we call cell culture media which is like their food why do i do this we observe the cells in a plate and they 're but what we 're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them what does that even mean well let 's say or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body not only that but they can also be used for disease models and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive we call this the biomimetic paradigm faithfully what else do we know about the heart well heart cells are pretty greedy nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very very dense blood supply in the lab we micro pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells and this allows us to flow the cell culture media the cells ' food through the scaffolds where we 're growing the cells a lot like what you might expect from a capillary capillary bed in the heart so this brings me to lesson number one let 's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be and after one week it 's beating you can see it in the upper but don 't worry if you can 't see it so well it 's amazing that these cells beat but that brings me to lesson number two cells do all the work in a sense tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here because structural engineers build bridges and big things let 's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way we are what we eat could easily be described as we are what but it 's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us i invite you to talk and in the meantime i wish you luck may none of your non cancer cells become endangered species thank you"
