  "transcript": "i 'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me i i believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place but if the startup organization is so great why do so many fail that 's what i wanted to find out i wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success and i wanted to try to be systematic about it avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions i have from so many companies i 've seen over the years i wanted to know this because i 've been starting businesses since i was twelve years old when i sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school i started so i tried to look across what factors i used to think that the idea was everything but then over time i never thought i 'd be quoting boxer mike tyson on the ted stage but he once said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face so much about a team 's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the and that 's why i came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues that started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success and then of course the timing is the idea way too early and the world 's not ready for it is it early as in you 're in advance and you have to educate the world is it just right and one hundred non idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it so first on these idealab companies the top five companies citysearch but didn 't succeed like airbnb and instagram and uber and youtube and linkedin and some failures and the results really surprised me the number one thing was timing timing accounted for forty two percent of the difference between success and failure team and the idea the differentiability of the idea the uniqueness of the idea that actually came in third the last two business model and funding made sense to me actually i think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are what you 're creating so now let me give you some specific examples about each of these so take a wild success like airbnb that everybody knows about well that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought no one 's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger of course people proved but one of the reasons it succeeded aside from a good business model a good idea same thing with uber uber came out incredible company incredible business model great execution too but the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system drivers were looking for extra money it was very very important some of our early goto com we started a company called z com it was an online entertainment company we were so excited about it we raised enough money we had a great business model but broadband penetration was too low in and the company eventually went out of business in two thousand and three just two years later when the codec problem was solved by adobe flash but unbelievable timing in fact youtube didn 't even have a business model when it first started it wasn 't even so what i would say in summary is execution definitely matters a lot the idea matters a lot but timing might matter even more and the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them and to be really really honest about it not be in denial about any results that you see because if you have something you love you want to push it forward but you have to be very very honest about that factor on timing and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn 't have happened otherwise thank you very much"
