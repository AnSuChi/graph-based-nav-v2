  "transcript": "bioenergy is not ethanol bioenergy isn 't global warming bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive bioenergy is oil it 's gas and part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way or put up these geo spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it so we 've been planting stuff for eleven thousand years and in the measure that we plant stuff what we learn from agriculture is you 've got to deal with pests you 've got to deal with then you 're going to be able to spread beyond the nile you so irrigation makes a you put together it 's brute force you put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides behind that natural system and you end up with systems that look like this so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that 's based on brute force and probably one of the this is a guy called norman borlaug he won the nobel prize he 's got the congressional medal of honor he deserves all of this stuff and he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind the reason why india and china no longer have these massive famines that is something that a lot of people have criticized but of course those are people who don 't realize that china and india instead of having huge amounts of starving people are exporting grains didn 't talked about why this technology should be thought about but not really applied and mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet there are in china and india and the institute that this guy ran it 's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world what happened in agriculture well if you take agriculture over a century agriculture yeah the plows look different the machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules but the farmer would have understood this is what the guy 's doing this is why he 's doing it this is where he 's going what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology and that 's where you get your here 's what happens to productivity basically you go from two hundred and fifty hours to produce one hundred bushels to forty to fifteen to five this is an absolutely massive increase it is mountains of stuff and fifty percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced you 're probably saying to yourself i thought i came to a talk about energy and here 's this guy talking about biology so where 's the link between these two things one of the ironies of this whole system is we 're discussing what to do about a system that we don 't understand we don 't even know what oil is we don 't know where oil comes from it 's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from the best assumption and one of the best guesses in this stuff is that this stuff and you get these black rivers now the interesting thing about that thesis if that thesis turns out to be true is that oil and all concentrating it in plants if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight bioenergy works in a different way and we 've got to start thinking of oil maybe that 's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas the types of wells that you 're beginning to see don 't look unlike those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots and we are getting really destructive as we 're going out and farming this bioenergy these are the and there 's an enormous amount first of mining the largest trucks in the world are working here it 's tied to the sand and then you 've got to use a lot of steam to separate it which only works at today 's oil prices coal coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure so this is what burned wheat kernels look like not entirely unlike coal and of course coalmines are very dangerous places any place you see a differential there 're some interesting questions there 's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff which are that is probably not the best use of bioenergy as you think of what are the alternatives to this system it 's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the u s is dwindling in its petroleum reserves but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves nor is china and we 've got to start thinking of them as biological energy because if we keep treating them as chemical energy engineering energy we 're going to be in deep doo doo and as you think of gas this is called coal bed methane the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up may be because there 's stuff it may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process if that is true then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip mountaintops off it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture that is what bioenergy is it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture from brute force into biological force we already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff ok if you put steam into coal fields or this is just the beginning stages of this stuff and you think of biomaterials this guy who did part of the sequencing of the human genome who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world and they 've been putting together companies like synthetic genomics like a cambria what those companies are trying to do is to think of how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force think of it in the following terms think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes think of the cell as a hardware and in the measure that you begin to think of life as then you 've got to shift your approach as to how you 're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way this is one of the gentle giants on the 's one of the nicest human beings you 've ever met his name is hamilton smith he won the nobel for figuring out how to cut genes and he 's such a modest guy that the day he won his mother called him and said i didn 't realize there was another ham smith at hopkins do you know he just won the nobel this guy is just a class act you find him at the bench every single day working on a pipette and building stuff and one of the things this guy just built are these things what is this this is the first transplant of naked dna insert it into a different cell and have that cell boot up as a separate species that 's one month old you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are we 're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies we 're going to start thinking about biology entering energy it both in economic terms and in energy terms this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta these are sulfur blocks because as you separate that petroleum from the sand and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor steam to separate this stuff you also have to separate out the sulfur the difference between light crude and heavy crude well it 's about fourteen bucks a barrel you reduce the system this has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind to the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear and hopefully you won 't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault just a thought the name of the game is hydrocarbons and this is what we 're dealing with and before i make this talk too long here 's what 's happening in the current energy system that means eighty six percent of the stuff we 're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff and there 's a role in here for conservation there 's a role in here for alternative stuff but we 've also got to get that other portion right and as we think of this bridge to the future one of the things you should ponder is we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells 're spending an enormous amount of money the ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol it may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy output this is what oil prices look like ok this is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low that company goes out of business and then you can bring the oil price back up"
