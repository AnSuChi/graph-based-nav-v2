  "transcript": "it 's about and it 's about rediscovering idealism in all of that there 's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed up fragmenting and i don 't believe in a life or history written as decision a led to consequence b led to consequence c these neat narratives that we 're presented with and that perhaps we encourage in each other i believe in randomness and i 'm colorblind i was born unable to see most colors this is why i wear and i 'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when i was a boy i loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot and i did the tests in the royal air force to become a pilot and sure enough i failed i couldn 't see all the blinking different lights and i can 't distinguish color and this was in fact relatively easy for me because i had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood which was international relations i was fascinated by the cold war by the inf negotiations over the proxy war between the soviet union and the u s in these things really interested me and so i decided quite at an early age i wanted to be a diplomat one day i announced this to my parents and my father denies this story to this day i said daddy i want to be a diplomat and he turned to me and he said carne you have to be very clever to be a diplomat and my ambition was sealed and twenty as those numbers suggest i was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world leather soled shoes and reveled in this this amazing access i had to world events i traveled to the gaza strip i headed the middle east peace process section in the british foreign ministry i became a speechwriter i negotiated with and i would travel and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate al qaeda from afghanistan surrounded by my special forces escort who themselves had to have an escort of a platoon of royal marines because it was so dangerous it was really interesting community of people and the pinnacle of my career as it turned out was when i was posted to new york norway various other places but i was posted to new york to serve on the u n security council for the british delegation and my responsibility was and there i dealt with things like the middle east peace process issue we can talk about that later if you wish but above all my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons and i was steeped in the we went through several wars during my time i negotiated for my country the resolution in the security council of the 12th of september two thousand and one condemning the attacks of the day before which were of course deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time so i lived the high life although i worked very long hours i lived in a penthouse in union square i was a single british diplomat in new york city you can imagine what that might have meant i had a good time but in two thousand and two when my tour came to an end i wasn 't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london i decided to take a sabbatical in fact at the new school bruce in some inchoate inarticulate way i realized that there was something wrong with my work with me and i was also disillusioned in a way i couldn 't quite put my finger on and i decided to take some time out from work the foreign office was very generous you could take these special unpaid leave as they called them and yet remain part of the diplomatic service but not actually do any work it was nice and eventually i decided to take a secondment to join the u n in kosovo which was again shows the randomness of life because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next somewhat reluctantly decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on wmd in the run up to the iraq war and i testified to that inquiry in secret i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd and my testimony to the inquiry said three things that and indeed our own internal assessment was very clear that iraq 's wmd did not pose a threat to its neighbors let alone to us secondly the government had ignored all which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still and that presented me with a crisis what was i going to do this testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues of my ministers who had in my view had perpetrated a war on a i went on and on and on to my long suffering wife and eventually i decided to resign from the british foreign service i felt there 's a scene in the al pacino movie the insider which you may know where he goes back to cbs after they 've let him down over the i felt so took a running leap and and i started to fall and i 'm still falling and in a way i kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than i like actually standing on top of the cliff wondering what to do a second thing happened in kosovo which kind of i need a quick gulp of water forgive me a second thing happened in kosovo which and eighteen people were killed it was anarchy and it 's a very horrible thing to see anarchy to know that the police and the military there were lots of military troops there actually can 't stop that rampaging mob who coming down the street and the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street and i went through it i went through those mobs and that riot taught me something which isn 't immediately obvious and it 's kind of a complicated story but one of the reasons that riot took place those riots which went on for several days took place was because the kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future there were diplomatic negotiations about the future of kosovo going on then and the kosovo government let alone the kosovo people were not actually participating in those talks there was this whole fancy diplomatic system this negotiation process about the and funnily enough they were frustrated about that those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration it wasn 't the only reason and life is not simple one reason narratives it was a complicated thing and i 'm not pretending it was more more simple than it was but that was one of the reasons and that kind of gave me the inspiration or rather to be precise it gave my wife why don 't you advise the kosovars why don 't you advise their government on their diplomacy and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service they were not allowed diplomats and so that was the idea that was the origin of the thing that became independent diplomat the world 's first diplomatic advisory group and and it began when i flew back from london from london after my time at the u n in kosovo i flew back and had dinner with the kosovo prime minister and said to him look i 'm proposing that i come and advise you on the diplomacy i know this stuff it 's what i do why don 't i come and help you and he raised his glass of raki to me and said yes carne come and i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government independent diplomat ended up advising three successive kosovo prime ministers and the multi party negotiation team of of kosovo and kosovo became independent independent diplomat is now and we 're advising seven or eight different countries or depending on how you wish to define them and i 'm not big on definitions we 're advising the northern cypriots on how to reunify their the government of southern sudan which you heard it here first is going to be a new country within the next few years we 're advising the polisario front of the western sahara who are fighting to get their country back we 're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations which is suppose to culminate in copenhagen there 's a bit of randomness here too because when i was beginning independent diplomat i went to a party in the house of lords which is a ridiculous place but and he said and i told him rather grandly i was going to establish independent diplomat in new york at that time there was just me and and he said why don 't you see my colleagues in new york and it turned out he what if which some of you have probably heard of and i ended up having a desk in what if and what if develop new flavors of chewing gum for wrigley or new flavors for coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the kosovars and for the saharawis of and i began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy that diplomacy like business is a business of solving problems things and independent diplomat today tries to incorporate some of the things i learned at what if we all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office we all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think and we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we 're dealing with but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to diplomatically personal and political and in a way they 're the same thing the personal one is and i recommend it and it 's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump independent diplomat is part of a trend which is that the world is fragmenting states mean less than they the power of the state is declining that means the power of others things is rising those other things are called non state actors they may be corporations they may be mafiosi they may be nice ngos they may anything any number of things we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world if governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in then that means who is left to deal with them who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them us who 's left to deal with it we have no choice but to embrace that reality and that you can leave it to governments to get on with al shabaab militia in somalia ask me how later particularly if you eat fish interestingly enough but that connection is there we are all intimately connected and this isn 't just tom friedman it 's actually provable in case after case after case what that means is instead of asking your politicians to do things you have to look to yourself to and independent diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way there aren 't neat examples but one example is this the way the world is changing is embodied in what 's going on at the place i used to work the u n security council the u n was established in eighty percent of the agenda of the u n security council is about conflicts within states separatists terrorists if you want to call them that when i realized this and when i look back on my time at the security council and what happened with the kosovars and i realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security council weren 't actually there weren 't actually invited to give their views to the security council i thought this is wrong something 's got to be done about this so i started off in a traditional mode we went around seventy u n member states the kazaks the ethiopians the israelis you name them we went to see them the secretary general all of them and said this is all wrong this is terrible that you don 't consult these people who are actually affected you 've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the kosovars to come and tell you what they think this will allow you to tell me you can tell them what you think it 'll be great you can have an exchange you can actually come back to us in maybe six months and of course nothing happened nobody did anything the security council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did so we looked at that observation of basically failure i 'm buggered if i 'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done so what we 're going to do is we 're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves so now independent diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the security council so we will be bringing the northern cypriots and the southern cypriots rebels from and we will be trying to bring the parties to new york to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting so there 's actually a conversation which has never before happened and describing all this any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult and i entirely agree with you the chances of failure are very high it certainly won 't happen if we don 't try to make it happen and i think that outputs is what matters not process not technology frankly so much either preach technology to all the twittering members of all the iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in tehran where ahmadinejad remains in power and in a way independent diplomat embodies that fragmentation that change that is happening to all of us"
