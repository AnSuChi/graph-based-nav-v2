  "transcript": "i want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth the skeleton bridges and tunnels the vascular system that powers the body are the oil and gas pipelines and electricity grids that distribute energy and the nervous system of communications satellites cellular networks and data centers that allow us to share information this infrastructural matrix already consists of sixty four million kilometers of roads four million kilometers of railways two million kilometers of pipelines what about international and we can start by overcoming some ancient mythology there 's a saying with which all students of history are familiar geography is destiny sounds so grave doesn 't it it it tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor small countries cannot escape their larger neighbors that vast distances are insurmountable i see an even greater force sweeping the planet in all of its forms transportation energy and communications has enabled such a quantum leap in the mobility of people of goods of resources of knowledge such that we can no longer even think of geography as distinct from it i view the two forces as fusing together into what i call represents a quantum leap in the mobility of people resources and ideas but it is an evolution an evolution which is how we actually use the world our global system is evolving through the horizontally interdependent nations of the 20th century into a global network civilization connectivity not sovereignty has become the organizing we are becoming this global network civilization because we are literally building it meanwhile our global infrastructure spending is projected to rise to nine trillion dollars per year within the coming decade and well it should we have been living off an infrastructure stock meant for a world population of three billion as our population has crossed seven billion to eight billion and eventually nine billion and more we should spend about one trillion dollars on the basic infrastructure needs of every billion people in the world not surprisingly asia is in the lead which together with a network of other organizations aims to construct a network of iron and silk roads stretching from shanghai to lisbon and as all of this topographical engineering unfolds spending so much more on building the foundations of global society rather than on the tools to destroy it can have profound profound consequences it is how mankind comes to be more than just the sum of its parts i believe that is what is happening planetary urbanization cities are the infrastructures that most define us by two thousand and thirty more than two thirds the technology powerhouse of silicon valley begins north of san francisco down to san jose and across the bay to oakland the sprawl of los angeles now passes san diego across the mexican border to tijuana san diego and tijuana now share an share an airport terminal where you can exit into either country america 's northeastern megalopolis begins in boston through new york and philadelphia to it contains more than fifty million people and also has plans for a high speed rail network but asia is where we really see the megacities coming together this continuous strip of light from tokyo through nagoya to osaka but in china megacity clusters are coming together with populations reaching one hundred million people the bohai and in the middle the whose geographic footprint is almost the same size as the country of austria and any number of these megacity clusters has a gdp approaching two trillion dollars that 's almost the same as all of india today such as the g20 were to base their membership on economic size rather than national representation whose population will soon exceed it too has a number of megacity clusters such as the delhi capital region and mumbai and in the gulf a necklace of city states is forming from bahrain and qatar through the united arab emirates to muscat in oman and then there 's lagos in a megacity by two thousand and thirty we will have as many as fifty such megacity clusters so which map tells you more our traditional map of two hundred discrete nations that hang on most of our walls or this map and yet even this is incomplete because you cannot understand any individual megacity without understanding its connections to the others any number of them such as sao paulo or istanbul or moscow has a gdp approaching or exceeding one third of one half of their entire national gdp but equally importantly it is home to the offices of almost every single multinational corporation that invests directly into south africa and indeed into the entire african continent they want to be part of this global division of labor that is how cities think i 've never met a mayor who said to me i want my city to be cut off know that their cities belong as much to the global network civilization as to their home countries but right now there are more than two hundred intercity learning networks thriving that is as many as the number of intergovernmental organizations that we have sustainable urbanization is it working but what we can see is that transferring technology and knowledge and policies between cities is how we 've actually begun to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies in many western cities young people don 't even want to anymore cities have been part of the problem now they are part of the solution when i travel through megacities from end to end it takes hours and days and yet but have we invested them in inclusive growth only when we build sufficient affordable public housing when we invest in robust transportation networks to allow people to connect to each other both physically and digitally that 's when our divided cities and societies will come to feel whole again and that is why infrastructure has just been included in the united nations sustainable development goals because it enables all the now cities can make the world more sustainable they can make the world more equitable i also believe that connectivity between cities can make the world more peaceful we see more trade more investment and more stability we all know the story of europe after world war ii where industrial integration kicked off a process that gave rise to today 's peaceful european by the way is the least connected of major powers in the international system and that goes a long way towards explaining the tensions today countries that have less stake in the system also have less to lose in disturbing it in north america the lines that matter most on the map are not the us canada border or the us mexico but the dense network of roads and railways and pipelines and electricity grids and even water canals that are forming an integrated north american union it needs more connections but the real promise of connectivity is in the postcolonial world all of those regions where borders have historically been the most arbitrary let 's take southeast asia where high speed rail networks are planned to connect bangkok to singapore and trade corridors from vietnam to myanmar now this it is evolving into what i call a pax asiana a peace among southeast asian nations a similar phenomenon is underway in east africa where a half dozen countries are investing in railways and multimodal corridors so that landlocked countries can get their goods to market now these countries coordinate their utilities and their investment policies they too are evolving into a pax africana in the nearly four hundred million people of the arab world are almost entirely urbanized and the only way to correct these mismatches but through more connectivity of pipelines and water canals but it should be connected internally integrated and productively connected to its neighbors europe asia and africa but we know from history that more connectivity is the only way to bring about stability in the long run because we know that in region after region is the new reality cities and countries are learning to aggregate but the real test is going to be asia since the end of take china and taiwan in the 1990s this was everyone 's leading world war iii scenario but since that time the trade and investment volumes across the straits have become so intense that last november leaders from both sides held a historic summit to discuss eventual peaceful reunification and even the election of a nationalist party in taiwan that 's earlier this year does not undermine this fundamental dynamic china and japan have an even longer history of rivalry and have been deploying their air forces and navies to show their strength in japanese cars are selling in record numbers there and guess where the largest number of foreigners residing in japan today comes from you guessed it china but today india is the second they 're building a trade corridor stretching from northeast india through myanmar and bangladesh to southern china their trade volume has grown from twenty billion dollars a decade ago to eighty billion dollars today but they 're also negotiating a trade agreement and want to complete a pipeline stretching from iran through pakistan to india and let 's talk about iran wasn 't it just two years ago that war with iran seemed inevitable ladies and gentlemen i cannot guarantee that world war iii will not but we can definitely see why it hasn 't happened yet and that is why their leaders think twice and decide to focus on economic ties over territorial tensions and by wrapping the world in such seamless physical and digital connectivity we evolve towards a world in which people can rise above their geographic we are the cells and vessels pulsing through these global connectivity networks hundreds of millions of people go online and work with people they 've never met and that 's expected to rise to three billion in the global network civilization"
