  "transcript": "when i joined my family on the picket line for the first time my mom made me leave my dolls in the minivan i 'd stand on a street corner in the heavy kansas surrounded by a few dozen relatives with my tiny fists clutching a sign that i couldn 't read yet gays are worthy of death this was the beginning our protests soon became a daily occurrence and an international phenomenon the end of my antigay picketing career and life as i triggered in part by strangers on twitter who showed me the power of engaging the other in my home life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil the good was my church and its members and the evil was everyone else my church 's antics were such that we were constantly at odds with the world and that reinforced our otherness on a daily basis make a difference between the unclean and the clean and so we did from baseball games to military funerals we trekked across the country with neon protest signs in hand to tell others exactly how unclean they were this was the only way for me to do a world that sits in satan 's lap and i pursued westboro 's agenda with a special sort of zeal in two thousand and nine that zeal brought me to twitter initially the people i encountered on the platform were just as hostile as i expected they were the digital version of the screaming hordes i 'd been seeing at protests since i was a kid but in the midst of that digital brawl a strange pattern developed pop culture references and smiley faces and it was civil full of genuine curiosity on both sides how had the other come to such outrageous conclusions about the world sometimes the conversation even bled into real life people i 'd sparred with on twitter would come out to the picket line to see me when i protested in their city a man named david was one such person he ran a blog called jewlicious and after several months of heated but friendly arguments and i brought him kosher chocolate and held a god hates jews sign there was no confusion about our positions but the line between friend and foe was becoming blurred we and it changed the way we spoke to one another it took time but eventually these conversations planted seeds of doubt in me and in doing so they were able to find inconsistencies i 'd missed my entire life why did we advocate the death penalty for gays when jesus said let he who is without sin cast the first stone how could we claim to love our neighbor while at the same time praying for god to destroy them the truth is that the care shown to me by these strangers on the internet was itself a contradiction it was growing evidence that people on the other side were not the demons i 'd been led to believe these realizations were life altering i couldn 't justify our actions especially our cruel practice of protesting funerals and celebrating human tragedy these shifts in my perspective contributed to a larger erosion of trust in my church and eventually it made it impossible for me to stay in spite of overwhelming grief and terror i left westboro in two thousand and twelve in those days just after i left the instinct to hide was almost paralyzing i wanted to hide from the judgement of my family who i knew would never speak to me again people whose thoughts and opinions had meant everything to me and i wanted to hide from the world i 'd rejected for so long people who had no reason at all to give me a second chance after a lifetime of antagonism unbelievably they did the world had access to my past because it was all over the internet thousands of tweets i wrote an apology for the harm i 'd caused but i also knew that an apology could never undo any of it all i could do was try to build a new life and find a way somehow to repair some of the but most of them didn 't and given my history it was more than i could 've hoped for forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt it still amazes me i spent my first year away from home we walked into an abyss we were shocked to find the light and a way forward in the same communities we 'd targeted for so long we slept on couches in the home of a hasidic rabbi and his wife and their four kids the same rabbi that i 'd protested three years earlier with a sign that said your rabbi is a whore we spent long hours talking about theology and judaism and life while we washed dishes in their kosher kitchen and chopped vegetables for dinner they held nothing against us and again i was astonished that period was full of turmoil but one part i 've returned to often is a surprising realization i had during that time that it was a relief and a privilege to let go of the harsh judgments that i realized that now i needed to learn i needed to listen this has been at the front of my mind lately because and still we grow more and more divided we want good things justice equality freedom dignity prosperity we 've broken the world into us and them only emerging from our bunkers long enough to lob rhetorical grenades at the other camp we write off half the country as no complexity no humanity even when someone does call for empathy and understanding for the other side the conversation nearly always devolves into a debate about who deserves more empathy we routinely refuse to acknowledge the flaws in our positions or the merits in our opponent we even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line what gives me hope is that we can do something about this the good news is that it 's simple we have to talk and listen to people we disagree with it 's hard because it means extending empathy and compassion to people who show us hostility the impulse to respond in kind is so tempting and i will always be inspired to do so by those people i encountered on twitter apparent enemies who became my beloved friends and in the case of one particularly understanding and generous i thought about it a lot over the past few years and i found four things they did differently that made real conversation possible and i do everything i can to employ them in difficult conversations today the first is don 't assume bad intent assuming ill motives almost instantly cuts us off from truly understanding why someone does and believes as they do we forget that they 're a human being with a lifetime of experience that shaped their mind and we get stuck on that first wave of anger and the conversation has a very hard time ever the second is ask questions when we engage people across ideological divides asking questions helps us map the disconnect between our differing points of view that 's important because we can 't present effective arguments if we don 't understand where the other side is actually coming from it signals to someone that they 're being heard when my friends on twitter stopped accusing and started asking questions i almost automatically mirrored them their questions gave me room to speak but they also gave me permission to ask them questions it fundamentally changed the dynamic of our conversation the third is stay calm this takes practice and patience but it 's powerful i thought my rightness justified my rudeness harsh tones raised voices insults interruptions explosive end when my husband was still just an anonymous twitter acquaintance our discussions frequently became hard and pointed but we always refused to he would change the subject he would tell a joke or recommend a book or gently excuse himself from the conversation we knew the discussion wasn 't over just paused for a time to bring us back to an even keel we have a buffer of time and space between us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating make the argument this might seem obvious but one side effect of having strong beliefs is that we sometimes assume that the value of our position is or should be obvious and self evident that we shouldn 't have to defend our positions because they 're so clearly right and good that if someone doesn 't get it it 's their problem that it 's not my job to educate them we would all see things the same way as kind as my friends on twitter were if they hadn 't actually made their arguments it would 've been so much harder for me to see the world in a different way we can 't expect others to spontaneously change their own minds if we want change we have to make the case for it my friends on twitter didn 't abandon their beliefs or their principles they channeled their infinitely justifiable offense and came to me with pointed questions tempered with kindness and humor i know that some might not have the time or the energy or the patience for extensive as difficult as it can be reaching out to someone we disagree with is an option that is available to all of us and i sincerely believe that we can do hard things escalating disgust and intractable conflict are not what we want for ourselves or our country or our next generation my mom a sign that i couldn 't read she was missing the bigger picture that we 're all just human beings that we should be guided by that most basic fact and approach one another with generosity and compassion each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up the end of this spiral of we just have to decide that it 's going to start with us thank you"
