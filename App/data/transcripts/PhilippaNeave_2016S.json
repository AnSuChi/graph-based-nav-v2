  "transcript": "the great philosopher aristotle said there 's no word for it and if there 's no word for something that something doesn 't so when we talk about elections we in established democracies we know what we 're talking about we 've got the words we have the vocabulary we know what a polling station is we know what a ballot paper is but what about countries where democracy doesn 't exist countries where there are no words to describe the concepts that underpin a democratic i work in the field of electoral assistance so that 's to say we assist emerging democracies to organize what is often their first elections so you 're one of these people who goes around the world imposing western democracy on countries that can 't handle it it really doesn 't and also what we do is firmly anchored in the one thousand nine hundred and forty eight so that 's the basis of the work i specialize in public outreach what does that mean another jargon it actually means designing information campaigns so that candidates and voters who have never had the opportunity to participate or to vote understand why it is important to take part so i 'll probably devise a specific campaign to reach out to women to make sure that they can take part that they can and it 's not always easy because very often in this work i 've noticed now over the years that i 've been doing it it 's a country with high levels of illiteracy and we organized two elections on the same day the reason was because the logistics are so incredibly difficult it seemed to be more efficient to do that it was but on the other hand explaining two elections instead of one was even more complicated so we used a lot of images and when it we had problems because so many people wanted to take part we had three hundred candidates for for fifty two seats wolesi jirga which is the parliamentary elections and for the provincial council we had even more candidates we had three hundred and thirty for fifty four seats so talking about ballot design is what the ballot looked like it 's the size of a newspaper this was the wolesi jirga ballot yeah and this was the provincial council ballot even more so you see we did use a lot of symbols and things like we had so many people who had never of course voted but we had extremely extremely high levels of illiteracy very very poor infrastructure for example i mean it 's a country the size of texas more or less we had seven kilometers of paved and that includes the tarmac where we landed the planes in juba airport so transporting electoral materials etc is exceedingly difficult but there were one hundred and that was extremely challenging then it was the arab spring a huge amount of and we were talking about various aspects of of the of the election and i was hearing them using words that i hadn 't actually heard before and i 'd worked with iraqis i 'd worked with jordanians egyptians and suddenly they were using these words and i just thought this is strange and what really gave rise to it was this word observer we were discussing and in a passive sort of sense as in i noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt did i go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not that is the role of an election observer it 's very active it 's governed by all kinds of treaties and it has got that control function in it and then i got wind of the fact because there is a term that 's already accepted and in use which was the word muraqib which means a controller it and with our colleagues we thought perhaps it 's our role to actually help make sure that the words are understood and actually and that 's what we did so together with these colleagues we launched the arabic lexicon of electoral terminology and we worked in eight different countries it meant actually defining four hundred and eighty one terms which formed the basis of everything you need to know if you 're going to organize a democratic election we defined these terms and we worked with the arab colleagues and came to and they use modern standard which is the arabic that is used across the whole region in newspapers and broadcasts so that was another added layer of complication so in one sense you had the problem that language wasn 't fully ripe if you like neologisms were coming up new expressions and so we defined all these terms and then we had eight correspondents in we submitted the draft to them they responded back to us yes we understand the definition we agree with it but this is what we say in our country because we were not the various countries so this i 'm happy to say it took three years to produce this because we also finalized the draft and took it actually into the field sat with the election commissions in all these different countries debated and defined and refined the draft date there 's about three thousand downloads off the internet in pdf form i heard just recently from a colleague that they 've taken it up in somalia they 're going to produce a version of this in somalia because there 's nothing in somalia at all so that 's that 's very and this newly formed arab are run in the region they 're using it as well and the arab league have now built up a pan arab observation unit and they 're using it so that 's all really good however this work of reference is is quite high pitched it 's complex and a lot of the terms are quite technical so the average person probably doesn 't need to know at least a third of it but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education it 's part of our and i feel it 's really the right of everybody to know how these things work and it 's a good thing to think about producing a work of reference for the average person and bearing in mind that now we have a basis to work with animation there 's all sorts of tools terrorism we hear about sectarianism and all this horrible negative let 's give them the means let 's give them the words the silent majority is silent because they don 't have the words the silent majority needs to know it is time to provide people with the knowledge tools that they can inform themselves with thank you very much"
