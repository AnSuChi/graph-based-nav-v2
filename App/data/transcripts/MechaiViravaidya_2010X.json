  "transcript": "now when i was a young man forty years ago but we didn 't begin with a welfare program or a poverty following a very successful maternal child health you need also family planning now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it in my country that was the case in so but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills we didn 't take no as an answer we took no no as a question we went to the nurses and the midwives who were also women and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill they 're not medical personnel no we decided to do a bit more actually below that yellow sign i wish they hadn 't wiped that because there was the people they chose were the people we chose so there we are we went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution wherever there were people and you can see boats with the women selling things here 's the floating market get to religion because in the philippines the catholic church was pretty strong we went to them and they said look could you help us i 'm there the one in blue not the yellow holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms and the women were saying no wonder we have no side effects it 's been blessed you need everybody to be involved and then we had a snakes and ladders game where you throw dice if you land on anything very good mother move ahead uncle gets drunk doesn 't use condom come back start again and the kids were doing it in school too we had relay races with condoms we had children 's condom blowing championship and before long the condom was know as the girl 's best friend we introduced our first microcredit program and the women who organized it said we only want to lend to women who practice family planning if you 're pregnant take care of your pregnancy if you 're not pregnant you can take a loan out from us and we decided to provide vasectomy to all men but in particular american men to the front of the queue right up to the ambassador 's residence during his [ unclear ] and the hotel gave us the ballroom for it very appropriate room and then the food is either hamburger or hotdog and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic laughter and here is this then young man called willy bohm who worked for the usaid and he was very happy it made a lot of news in america and it angered some people also i said don 't worry come over and i 'll do the whole lot of you and what happened in all this thing from seven children you could call it the coca cola approach if you like it was exactly the same thing i 'm not sure whether coca cola followed us or we followed coca cola but we 're good friends and so that 's the case of everyone joining in we didn 't have a strong government we didn 't have lots of doctors but it 's everybody 's job who can change attitude and behavior so our they have more than the government and they 've got more guns than and then we got a new prime minister soon after that and he said mechai could you come and join he asked me in because he liked my fifty fold every ministry even judges had to be involved in aids education everyone and we said the public institutions religious institutions schools and we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising and these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and hiv were known as mother theresa and then we went down one more step these are primary school kids giving aids information and this and then we have this captain condom you need a symbol of something you need a symbol and this is probably the best thing he 's ever done with his mba and then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets everywhere everywhere in taxis you get condoms and also in traffic the policemen give you giving clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season and these were the condoms that we introduced one says and then it says here with the american flag don 't leave home without it but let me warn you condoms can do so many things look at this i gave this to al gore and to bill senior also stop global warming use condoms and then this is the picture i mentioned to you why just run around and then finally in thailand we 're buddhist we don 't have a god so instead we say in rubber we trust so you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people we had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools because and then what happened after all this time everybody joined in according to the so it just there was political commitment some financial commitment and everybody joined in the fight so just don 't leave it to the but in cooperation with the business community because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit those are the things to be provided by the business community little business people the only way out of poverty is through business enterprise so that was done the money goes from the company because they have brought the money in and then before getting a loan you must be trained here 's what we call a barefoot mba teaching people how to do business so that when they borrow money they 'll succeed with the business these are and this is very interesting nike ice cream and nike biscuits this is a village sponsored by nike they said they should stop making shoes and clothes make these better because we can afford them thai silk now we 're making scottish tartans as you can see on the left to sell to all people of scottish and then this is our answer to starbucks in thailand coffee and condoms see starbucks you awake we keep you awake and alive that 's the difference and then now finally in education we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it 's a and it 's a center a focal point and here is a bamboo building all of them are bamboo this is a geodesic dome made of so they raise their own vegetables and then finally i firmly believe if we want the mdgs to work the millennium development goals we need to add family planning to it of course child mortality first the next olympics to be involved and these are our thai tulips thank you very much indeed"
