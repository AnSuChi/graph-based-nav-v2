  "transcript": "the age of genomics your genome is the entire sequence of your dna your sequence and mine are slightly different skin deep the headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases maybe even shape our personality or give us mental disorders our genes seem to have awesome power what do you guys think are you more than your genes audience yes yes i think some people agree with me i think we should make a statement i think we should say it all together you guys are really great maybe you can humor me and say this well so far only one connectome is known that of this tiny worm its modest nervous system consists of just three hundred neurons and in the a team of scientists mapped all seven thousand connections between the neurons in this diagram every node is a neuron and every line is a connection this is the connectome of the worm c elegans your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains one hundred billion neurons and ten thousand times as many connections there 's a diagram like this for your brain but there 's no way it would fit on this slide your connectome contains one million times more connections since the 19th century neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories the information that makes you you maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain 's neurons and perhaps other aspects of your personal identity maybe your personality and your intellect maybe they 're also encoded in the connections between your neurons and so now you can see why i just want you to remember it we don 't know if this hypothesis is correct because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor and to find the connectomes of brains more like our own and in the next few minutes i 'll tell you about some of these technologies which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of of my collaborators now you 've probably seen pictures of neurons before you can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes they extend long and delicate so let 's meet bobby kasthuri who works in the laboratory of jeff lichtman at harvard university bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain and we 're zooming in by a factor of one hundred thousand times and we color in the and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice and we keep on doing that slice after slice if we continue through the entire stack we can reconstruct the three dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron and we can do that for another neuron in green and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations and these are what are called you should see small circles and so when the green neuron wants to communicate it wants to send a message to the red neuron it spits out neurotransmitter at the synapse the two neurons are said to be connected how can we find an entire connectome well we take this three dimensional stack of images three dimensional coloring book we color every neuron in in a different color and then we look through all of the images find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse now at this point you 've learned the basics of neurons and synapses and so i think we 're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience how are the brains of men and women different everything in their life is connected to everything else you guys are laughing but you know this book changed my life laughter but what 's wrong with this you already know enough to tell me what 's wrong with this this statement or maybe really really fine capellini with branches just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate one neuron touches many other neurons through their branches one neuron can be connected to so many other neurons because there can be synapses at these points of contact by now you might have and so let 's do a series of comparisons to show you i assure you this is very tiny it 's just six microns on a side so here 's how it stacks up against an entire neuron and you can tell that really only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube and that 's just a mouse brain so when show my friends this sometimes they 've told me me you know sebastian you should just give up neuroscience is hopeless because if you look at a brain with your naked eye you don 't really see how complex it is but when you use a microscope finally the hidden complexity is revealed his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space and as a scientist i 'm not supposed to talk about my feelings too much information professor but at times i have also felt despair why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity how could we even dare to think and indeed these days i harbor new hopes someday a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse i do not know but i hope that i will live to see that day because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time it will take the work of generations to succeed but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that i am my connectome for now let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis that it 's actually worth taking seriously as you grow during childhood and age during adulthood your personal identity changes slowly likewise every connectome what kinds of changes happen and they can lose old ones and they can be eliminated and they can grow smaller second question what causes these but that 's not the whole story because there are signals electrical signals that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch these signals are called neural activity and there 's a lot of evidence that neural activity feelings and perceptions our mental experiences and that 's why every connectome is unique even those of genetically identical twins the connectome is where nature meets nurture what 's in this picture a cool and refreshing stream of water you say what else is in this picture do not forget that groove in the earth called the stream bed without it the water would not know in which direction to flow i would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity neural activity is constantly changing it 's like the water of it never sits still the connections of the brain 's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity but the metaphor is richer than that because but over long timescales and if you 'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights i will remind you that neural activity and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness neural activity is its water and the connectome is its bed suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work how will we go about testing the hypothesis i am my connectome i propose a direct test let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes consider the memory and so on down the line because they 're not going to look like this they 're going to be scrambled up and if we can do that the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain and if that were successful that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this i hope not but if you have you know it 's very easy to make a mistake what 's the total length of wires in your brain i 'll give you a hint it 's a big number i estimate millions of miles you can easily see there is huge potential for mis wiring of the brain and indeed the popular press loves headlines like anorexic brains are wired differently or autistic brains are wired differently and so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis wiring of the brain to see mental disorders sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication philosophers know this game i think i mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species one of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics if you pay one hundred thousand dollars you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an arizona warehouse awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality calling them fools or will they someday chuckle over our graves we know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing but not for the mind we cannot ridicule i 've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small and propels us to the world of the far future connectomes will mark a turning point in human history as we evolved from our ape like ancestors on the african savanna what distinguished us was our larger brains eventually these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains i believe that this voyage of not just for scientists but for all of us and i 'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today thank you"
