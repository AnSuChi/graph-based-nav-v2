  "transcript": "my favorite topic is but i will demonstrate different ways first ninety degrees palm but i will first teach you hold the hand like this palm up don 't move the wrist the wrist is i doesn 't speak very many but i do the best what i are and i forward don 't move the wrist over the heart you have got to this position from this without moving the wrist now the shortcut palm down you can that was the warming up now i need an assistant i talked to a nice and i will give my tribute to water i think it 's enough with water for me the other guys can talk about i will demonstrate different ways of memorizing control cards and so on and don 't gamble but so if we are if we have now i will interact so a different person and i had a mat here to make it a little the critical moment is if a card shark gathers the cards together immediately when he so i think number three i have arranged them in a full house with queens and it so here you see the contrast when i treat the cards and two tens also the other hand is good if all the other guys have good hands too so these guys have actually a stronger hand three aces and two kings this guy beats them with four of a kind or deuce deuce i will have the winning hand ten jack queen so please if you are interested i will demonstrate some underground techniques the first term is estimation here i can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush of course so here i have actually so here a term i think i know about where the cards are i will spread the cards and you 'll say stop when i point to them right another term called shuffle tracking this is a little risky so because if you look now i can still see and shuffle to follow my cards i must look at the shuffle from the if you pass the left brain you have to take care of logic and common sense direct in the right brain that 's much better and so arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing and you have that 's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge where you can find any solution of not at the last card zoe stop lg but we will check not in order it that was a mistake no i 'm kidding now and then i put in a mistake just to emphasize how difficult it is right yeah last night i forgot that that was a mistake but now i 'm glad i remember it so this deck is bought here sorry i have a little pad to make it a little softer this deck is bought here in america it 's called now you can carry this in your wallet so then you have to push it down again here please if you push these heaps everyone see push them together so they are really interlaced and then i will demonstrate a thing from russian satellite stealen stolen probably copied from america but we will see here i talk about shortcuts i go very quick but you know i think you are familiar with and it 's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern and not concentrate if you concentrate and calculate then you go to so now different persons all the time when i lift the heap i peek but in slow motion so you can follow i like to but now i do it the regular speed right so now i will drop the cards not the last yes that 's difficult to find a card here we do it when the cards are in the and now a card with a contrast of five of clubs i will do the most difficult thing and you let the other guys peek this card it shall so here i grab yes this is a tough one because here i must take so now a false count which card shall i use queen or five when i put one card at a table look it 's not one card it 's look it 's a bunch of cards that gives this now some hard stuff don 't look at the beam my fault when i deal the cards in the laser did the camera got it do the cameras see the cards now back the other one take back the queen i think there are lots of i don 't know how many but ten fifteen spades in a deck at least right laughter then i arrange them so i can get them quick so i start with the ace so i arrange the spades the clubs you see i don 't work with prestige so always do mistakes and now and then i get some extra sympathy points so i find correct yeah ok another suit please armani who said armani which size this is tough i had if i drop the card face up like this you reverse it i work with pattern why do i put myself in this position i will try to find blindfolded at this distance it works immediately but it was you can take the nostril too because some guys think but i like her yeah i said be a little rely on other senses right i work with vibration just kidding warming up king of hearts and you can see but the wrong color spades sorry remind me it 's a gift two and it was two of i 'll do it quick now three three of diamonds this is maybe a little tough we will try and it 's not at the bottom here so next card will be was it five i know where it is because i peeked before and then i love this jonny wayne move"
