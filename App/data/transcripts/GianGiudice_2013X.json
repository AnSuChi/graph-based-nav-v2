  "transcript": "it was a historical day but as the but for me the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution too many questions are left unanswered the symmetry the elegance of the rest of the elementary particle world we were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the higgs boson instead so far the measurements coming from the lhc show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena the verdict is not definitive and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far let 's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us and to explain my point let me first tell you what the higgs is about and to do so we have to go back and according to the higgs theory at that instant a dramatic event took place in the universe underwent a phase transition but in our case the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside but is about a change of the very fabric of but it has a physical reality it surrounds us all the time just like the air we breathe in this room because it is the stuff the higgs bosons are made of and this in a nutshell but this story is far more interesting than that theoretical physicists discovered not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics just like matter the substance that fills and the mere existence of another state of the higgs field poses a potential problem this is because and the phenomenon i could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room practically penetrating the wall because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small you would have to wait a really long time before it happens but believe me quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon and it has been observed in many systems but let 's go back to the higgs field bubbles of vapor form inside the water then they expand turning liquid into into gas in the same the bubble would then expand at the speed of light invading all space and turning the higgs field from the familiar state into a new state but the intensity of the higgs field is critical for the structure of matter we would see atoms shrinking neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei nuclei disintegrating but billions of times and if space time were filled by this higgs state all atomic matter would collapse no molecular structures would be possible no life so i wonder is it possible that in the future the higgs field will undergo a phase transition through quantum tunneling will be transformed into this nasty ultra dense state and experiments at the lhc found that because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a dna constituent so armed with this information from the lhc we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into and we found a very intriguing result our calculations showed that the measured value of the higgs boson mass is very special it has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation so and eventually the higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself so is this how humanity is going to disappear i don 't think so and this is a very long time it 's even longer than than the time it takes for italy to form a stable government even so we will be long gone by then and our earth will be if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate you will not even be but the reason why i am interested in the transition of the higgs field is because i want to address the question why is the higgs boson mass so special why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition theoretical physicists always ask why questions more than how a phenomenon works theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the and indeed a possible answer to my question literally it has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles and each bubble is a different universe and in this context you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the higgs mass it would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach in principle you could imagine to and the reason is simple near to collapse and something similar could happen for the higgs boson mass in the multiverse because of two competing effects just as in the case of sand my story have an end because we still don 't know the end of the story this is out of this number we learn so much i started from a hypothesis that the known particles are all there is in the universe even beyond the domain explored so far from this we discovered that the higgs field that permeates space time may be standing on a knife edge ready and we discovered that this but i don 't know if my hypothesis is right that 's how physics works a single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe but whichever it turns thank you"
