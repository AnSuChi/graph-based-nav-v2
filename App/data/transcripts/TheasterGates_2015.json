  "transcript": "one of the things that really excites me in my artistic practice and and being trained as a potter is that you very quickly learn how to make great things out of nothing that i spent a lot of time at my wheel with mounds of clay and that the limitations of my capacity my ability was i would have to learn how to make a foot that that process of learning has been very very helpful to my life there have been times in my artistic capacity that i wanted to reflect on other really important moments in the history of the u s the history of the world where tough things happened but how do you talk about tough ideas without separating people from that content could i use art like these old discontinued firehoses from alabama to talk about the complexities of a construction guy he owned small businesses and at eighty he was ready to retire and his tar kettle was my inheritance it wasn 't it was stinky but i asked my dad if he would be willing to if we could reimagine this kind of nothing material and by elevating the material and my dad 's skill could we start to think about tar helping us to imagine what was possible i was then it 's not really about the material it 's about our capacity to shape things i became more and more interested in ideas and more and more things that were happening just outside my studio just to give you a little bit of context i live in chicago i live on the south side now i 'm a west sider but if i didn 't mention that i was a west sider there would be a lot of people in the city that would be very upset the neighborhood that i live in is grand crossing it 's a neighborhood that has seen better days it is not a gated community by far there is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood and while i was there was all of this stuff that was happening just outside my studio and i feel like we talk about it with some of our cities more than others but i think a lot of our u s cities and beyond have the challenge of blight abandoned buildings that people no longer know what to do anything with and so i thought is there a way that i could start to think about these buildings as an extension or an expansion of my artistic practice real estate finance people that us together might be able to kind of think in more complicated ways about the reshaping of cities once i bought the building for about eighteen thousand dollars i didn 't have any money left so i started sweeping the building as a kind of and we found that that building on my block dorchester we now referred to the block as dorchester projects that in a way that building became a kind of gathering site for lots we turned the building into what we called now the archive house that we were but the contents of what happens in those buildings is also very important so we were not only thinking about between one neighbor and another and other books from an old bookstore that was going out of business i was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as i could with whatever and whoever would join me in chicago there 's amazing building stock this building which had been the former crack house on the block so this space we converted into what we call black that if we wanted to show an old melvin van peebles film we could if we wanted to show car wash we could that would be awesome and we had to move to a larger space black cinema house which was made from just a small piece of clay had to grow into a much larger piece of clay which is now my my studio what i realized was that for those of you who are they were not and that there are city policies that say hey a house that is residential needs to stay residential but what do you do in neighborhoods when when ain 't nobody interested in living there that the people who have the means to leave have already left what do we do with these abandoned buildings and so i was trying to wake them up using culture that we had to then find bigger it was in pretty bad shape and so we just started imagining what else what else could happen in this building and so now that the rumor of my block has spread and lots of people are starting to visit we 've found that the bank can now be a center for and that there are people who are now interested in being adjacent to those buildings because we brought some heat that we kind of made a fire we 've also started to collect memorabilia from american history from people who live or have lived in that neighborhood some of these images are degraded images of black people kind of histories of very and where better than a neighborhood with young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity to talk about some of the complexities of race and class and that if we could start to make multiple hubs and connect some cool green stuff around there that the buildings that we 've purchased and that if we could land miniature versailles on top of that and connect these buildings by a beautiful greenbelt that this place where people never wanted to be would become it feels very much like that we we tackle the things that are at our wheel we try with the skill that we have to think about this next bowl that i want to make and it went from a bowl to a singular house to a block to a neighborhood to a cultural district to thinking about the city and at every point there were things that i didn 't know that i had to learn i 've never learned so much about zoning law in my life i never thought i 'd have to so people started asking us well theaster how are you going to go to scale found was that i couldn 't export myself and that often those people who are passionate about a place are disconnected from the resources necessary to make cool things happen or from a contingency of people that could help make things happen so now we 're starting to give advice around the country how to start with the things that are in front of you how to make something out of nothing how to reshape your world at a wheel thank you so much thank you so i think many people watching this will give us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired about their city can do to take on projects like yours the things i 've found that 's really important is giving thought to not just the kind of individual project like an old house but what 's the relationship between an old house a local school a small bodega and is there some kind of synergy between those things can you get those folk talking found that in cases where neighborhoods have failed they still often have a pulse how do you identify the pulse in that place the passionate people reenergized about the place that they live and so someone has to do that work and then in the window i think that you actually have to curate more than that that there 's a way in which you have to be mindful about and then are there people who live in this place who want to grow those businesses with me because i think it 's not just a cultural space or housing so thinking about those things together 's hard to get people to create the spark again when people have been slogging for twenty years are there any methods you 've found that have have helped break through tg yeah when the media is constantly saying that only violent things happen in a place then based on your skill set and the particular context what are the things that you can do in your in your neighborhood to kind of fight some of that if you 're a theater person you have outdoor street theater festivals but if we can then find ways of making sure that i think really amazing things can happen interesting and how can you make sure that the projects you 're creating are actually for the disadvantaged and not just for the sort of vegetarian indie movie crowd that might move in to to take advantage of them tg right on so i think this is where it starts to get into so it 's reasonable to say that grand crossing is already in the process of being something but are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts or development that starts to protect some of the space that happens but you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece but entities that are interested in the stabilization piece so how do you start to grow up important watchdogs that ensure that the resources that are available to new folk that are coming in are also distributed to folk who have lived in a place for a long time jc that makes there would be others who would argue that funds would be better spent on basic services for the disadvantaged how do you combat believe that beauty is a basic service applause often what i have found is that when there are resources that have not been made available to certain under resourced that sometimes culture is the thing that helps to but i think that there 's a way in which if you can start with culture and get people kind of reinvested in their place and then people can make a demand that 's a poetic demand they also become very poetic jc it makes perfect sense to me theaster thank you so much for"
