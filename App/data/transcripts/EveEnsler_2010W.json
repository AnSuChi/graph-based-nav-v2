  "transcript": "me was composed of stories of cravings of strivings of desires of the future but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome me was always trying to become something somebody me only existed in the trying my body was often in the way i actually only wore and to be honest it never occurred to me that you had a body all this time i lived in the city because to be honest i was afraid of trees i never had babies because heads cannot give birth babies actually don 't come out of your mouth i began to ask other women about their bodies in particular their vaginas because i thought vaginas were kind of important one night on stage i it was an ecstatic experience it scared me it energized me and then i became a driven person a driven vagina i began to see my body like a thing a thing that could move fast like a thing that could accomplish other things many things all at once i began to see my body like an ipad i didn 't have patience for my body i snapped it into shape sure i had moments of appreciation of my body but all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body a further disassociation like planting a vegetable field on a freeway many women started to tell me about theirs their stories about their bodies actually these stories compelled me around the world and i 've been to over i heard thousands of stories and i have to tell you there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body some women became quiet and disappeared other women became mad driven machines like me well my stomach it was my stomach i hated it was proof that i had not measured up that i was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape my stomach was proof that i had failed that it had failed me that it was broken but the more i talked about it the more objectified and fragmented my body became it became entertainment it became a new kind of commodity something i was selling i went to the democratic republic of congo i heard about a little girl i heard woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that there are thousands of these stories and many of the women had holes in their bodies holes fistula that were the violation of war holes in the fabric of their souls these stories saturated my cells and nerves and to be honest the destruction of vaginas militias were raping babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iphones and computers my body had not only become a driven machine but it was responsible now for destroying other women 's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine then i got cancer i had a body a body that was pricked and poked and punctured a body that was cut wide open a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it a body that was burning from chemicals cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection it was happening now the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical the cancer of stress for not achieving enough the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness in his new and visionary book you are also divided from the body of the world rather than the living continuum to which you belong before cancer the world was something other it was as if i was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea now i lay down in the grass and i rub my body in it and i love the mud on my legs and feet now i make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the seine and the scar that runs the port au prince i know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation the sixteen ounces of puss is the contaminated gulf of and the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the earth cries out from the drilling in my second chemo my mother got very sick and i went to see and in the name of connectedness the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved gulf of mexico and i prayed that the oil wouldn 't wash up on her beach before she died and gratefully it didn 't and she died quietly in her favorite place and a few weeks later i was in new orleans and this beautiful spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me and i was honored and i went to her house and it was morning and the morning new orleans sun was filtering through the curtains and the honey makes it sweet and i said but what 's the water part and in the name of connectedness it 's the gulf of mexico and i said of course it is and she sang i mean her whole body sang and the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother it was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion it was finally being it was the sorrow that 's taken it was the congolese women who are now it was the realization that i had come very close to dying in the same way that the earth our mother is barely holding on in the same way that seventy five percent of the planet are hardly scraping by in the same way that there is a recipe for survival what i learned is it has to do with attention it was people who came with spells and rituals it was in my body"
