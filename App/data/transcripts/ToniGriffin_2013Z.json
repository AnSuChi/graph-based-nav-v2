  "transcript": "and the population had plummeted by twenty five percent between two thousand and many people were beginning to write it off as it had topped the list of american shrinking cities by two thousand and ten i had also been asked by the kresge foundation and the city of detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process for the city to create a shared vision for its future harlem which is my current home washington and newark new jersey and devoting whole issues to i was asked by a good friend fred bernstein to do an interview for the october issue of architect magazine and he and i kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title can this planner save detroit so i 'm smiling with a little bit of embarrassment right now because obviously it 's completely absurd that a single person let alone a planner could save a city but i 'm also smiling because i thought it represented a sense of hopefulness that our profession it 's just after a special mayoral election and word has gotten out that there is going to be this citywide planning process which brings a lot of anxiety and fears among detroiters and people came out from all over the city including areas city at that time put their hands across their chest and go i know you people are trying to move me out of my house right so that question is really powerful and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment many of them told us the stories about how they came to own their home through their grandparents or great grandparents who were one of one point six million people who migrated from the rural south to the industrial north as depicted in this painting by jacob lawrence the great migration they came to detroit for a better way of life many found work in the automobile industry the ford motor company as depicted in this mural by diego rivera in the detroit institute of art the fruits of their labors would afford them a home for many the first piece of property that they would ever know and a community with other home buyers the first couple of decades of their life in the north is quite well which coincides with the city 's peak population at one point eight million people during that same period between one thousand nine hundred and fifty and two thousand two thousand and ten the city loses sixty percent of its population and today it hovers at above seven hundred thousand and that they can see several citywide there are eighty thousand vacant homes they can also see vacant property they 're beginning to see illegal activities on these properties and they know that because the city has lost so much population now to quickly give you all a sense of a scale because i know that sounds like a big number but i don 't think so if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together it looks like about twenty square miles and that 's roughly equivalent to the size of the island we 're sitting on today which are creating a great sense of community stewardship but they 're very very clear to tell us that this is not enough that they want to see their neighborhoods return to the way that their grandparents had found them now there 's been a lot of speculation ten about what to do with the vacant property and so many people would say to us what if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland it can provide fresh foods and it can put detroiters back to work too because you can imagine that they didn 't sacrifice moving from the south to the north to create a especially in a city where they came with little less than a high school education or even a grammar school education and were able to afford the basic elements of the american dream steady work and a home that they owned now there 's a third wave of migration happening in detroit a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs similarly we have small manufacturing companies making conscious decisions to relocate to the city deliberately chose to relocate to detroit and they they quote and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things now we have community stewardship happening in neighborhoods and we have businesses relocating and this is all in the context of what is no secret to us all and just this july filed for chapter nine we started this process and by two thousand and thirteen we released detroit future city which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence not what it was but what it could be looking at new ways of economic growth new forms of land use more sustainable and denser neighborhoods a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system and a heightened but the economy was too small very different from a denver or an atlanta or a philadelphia that are anywhere between people there had to be an acceptance that we were not going to be able to use all of this vacant land in the way that we had before and maybe for some time to come it wasn 't going to be our traditional residential neighborhoods as we had before was not the only answer that what we had to do is look at these areas where we had significant vacancy but still had a significant number of population so we came up with one neighborhood typology there are several called a live make neighborhood abandoned structures majority eighty two percent african american population so they too could take businesses that they maybe were doing out of their home and grow them to more prosperous industries and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses so that it could and actually helped or we could use it as research plots where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils so the descendants of the great migration could either become precision watchmakers at shinola like willie h who was featured in one of their ads last year or they can actually grow a business that would service companies like shinola the good news is there both those there now and those that want to come so no thank you mayor menino who recently was quoted as saying i 'd blow up the place and start over there are very important people thank you"
