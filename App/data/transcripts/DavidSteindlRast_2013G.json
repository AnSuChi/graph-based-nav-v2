  "transcript": "there is something and there is something i know about and that 's very central to your concerns that is the very mainspring of whatever they do in this we are all together how but it 's already a lot now my topic is gratefulness what is the connection between happiness and gratefulness but think again is it really and they are not happy and we all know people who have lots of misfortune they radiate happiness you are surprised why because they are grateful now we can ask what do how does it work we experience something and it 's really you haven 't traded it in you haven 't worked for it it 's just given to you and when these two things come together something that 's really valuable to me and i realize it 's freely given then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart happiness now the key to all this is that we cannot only have grateful experiences by experiencing by becoming aware it 's a you haven 't brought it about in any way you have if we didn 't have this we wouldn 't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything and this now we say what you are really grateful for is the opportunity not the thing that is given to you because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn 't have the opportunity to enjoy it to do something with it and we have this saying opportunity knocks only once well every moment is a new gift over and over again and another moment or we can miss it behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands moment by moment does that mean that we can be grateful for everything certainly not we cannot be grateful for violence for war for oppression for exploitation on the personal level we cannot be grateful for the loss of a friend for unfaithfulness i didn 't say we can be grateful for everything i said we can be grateful in every given moment and even when we are confronted it isn 't as bad as it might seem when you look at it and and we only miss it because learning patience for instance we have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint but is more like a marathon that takes patience may be that 's an opportunity that is given to us but they are opportunities and those who avail themselves of those opportunities are the ones that we they make something out of life and those who fail get another opportunity so how can we find a method that will harness this how can each one of us find a method for living gratefully not just once in a while being grateful but moment by moment how can we do it it 's a very simple method it 's so simple that that 's all but how often do we we miss the opportunity because we don 't stop and we have to build stop signs into our lives when i was in africa some years ago and then came back i noticed every time i clicked on the light and every time i turned it on so leave it up to your own imagination you can find whatever works best for you but you need stop signs in your life and when you stop you open your ears you open your nose you open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us there is no that is what life is all about to enjoy to enjoy what is given to us and then we can also open our hearts our hearts for the and when we open our hearts to the opportunities the opportunities invite us to do and really do something mostly it 's the opportunity to enjoy but sometimes it 's something more difficult because we are and you will be surprised if you i am always surprised when i hear how many times this word gratefulness and gratitude comes up everywhere you find it a grateful airline i have even come across a toilet paper whose brand it can change our world in immensely you 're not fearful and if you 're not fearful you 're not violent you act out of a sense of enough but it makes for equal respect and that is the important thing the future of the world will be a network and it 's so revolutionary that it even because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down and those on the bottom are now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before what we need is a networking of smaller groups smaller and smaller groups who know one another who interact with one another and that is a grateful world a grateful world is a world of are joyful people and joyful people the more and more joyful people there are the more and more we 'll have a joyful world we have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something and there have been fifteen million candles lit in one decade people are becoming aware that a grateful world and and that is what i hope for us and this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same stop"
