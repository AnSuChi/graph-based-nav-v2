  "transcript": "be talking about the success of my campus the university of maryland baltimore county umbc across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas what makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder students of color students and what makes the story especially unique is that we have learned how to help african american and so i begin with a story about my childhood we all are products of our childhood experiences it 's hard for me to believe that it 's been fifty years since i had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in birmingham alabama a kid who loved getting a a kid who loved math who loved to read a kid who would say to the teacher when the teacher said here are ten problems to the class this little fat kid would say give us ten more and the whole class would say shut up freeman and so i was always asking this question well how could we get more kids to really love to learn and amazingly one week in in church when i really didn 't want to be there and i was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems i heard this man say this if we can get the children to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in birmingham we can show america that even children know the difference between right and wrong and that children really do want to get the best possible education and i looked up and said who is that man and they said his name was dr martin luther king and i said to my parents i 've got to go i want to go i want to be a part of this and they said absolutely not quite frankly you really did not talk back to your parents and somehow i said you know you guys are hypocrites you make me go to this you make me listen the man wants me to go and now you say no and they came into my room the next morning they had not slept they had been literally crying and praying and thinking will we let our and then all of a sudden i began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses and i got really scared i really did and one of the points i make to people all the time is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous it doesn hand me down books and as a result of that experience in the middle of the week while i was there in jail dr king came and said with our parents what you children do this day will have an impact on children who have not been born i recently realized that two thirds of americans today had not been it 's history the most important for me was this that children can be empowered they can be taught to be passionate about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking and so it is especially significant that the university i now lead the university of maryland baltimore county umbc was founded the very year i went to jail with dr king in one thousand nine hundred and sixty three it was the first university in our state founded at a time when students of all races could go there where people from all backgrounds can come and learn and learn to work together and learn to become leaders and to support each other in that experience now what is especially important about that experience for me is this we found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences and so we began to work on that for years in the ' 60s and we produced a number of people in law all the way to to the humanities we produced great artists beckett is our muse but when i looked at the data what i found first of all the group at the bottom african american students and then hispanic students and and what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things and the question is this how is it that now we lead the country in producing african americans who go on to complete ph d ' s in science and engineering and that 's a big deal give me a hand for that that 's a big deal that 's a big deal it really is you see most people don 't realize that it 's not just minorities who don 't do well in science while twenty percent of blacks and hispanics who begin with a major in science and engineering will actually graduate in science and engineering it of whether you know it or not large numbers of students with high sat 's and large numbers of a p credits who go to the most prestigious universities in our country begin in and the number one reason we find quite frankly is they did not do well in first year science i know i we need to find ways of making it happen so what are the four things we did to help minority students that it takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students their grades the rigor of the course work but equally it takes an understanding that it 's hard work that makes the difference i don 't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are smart simply means you 're ready to learn 're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions i i rabi a nobel laureate said that when he was growing up in new york all of his friends ' parents would ask them what did you learn in school at the end of a day and he said in contrast his jewish mother would say izzy did you ask a good question today but to become the very best to excel because you need a strong foundation if you 're going to move to the next level every foundation makes the difference in the next level he retook the course that young man went on to graduate from umbc to become the first black to get the m d ph d from the university of pennsylvania he now works at harvard nice story give him a hand for that too but she had a factor that was very important she never missed a day of school k 12 tenure track in psychiatry ph d in neuroscience she and her adviser have a patent on a second use of viagra for diabetes patients big hand for her secondly the idea building community among the students you all know that so often in science and engineering we tend to think cutthroat students are not taught to work in groups and that 's what we work to do with that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world so building community among those students very important third the idea of it takes researchers to produce researchers as and one great example that you 'll appreciate during a snowstorm in baltimore several years ago the guy on our campus with this howard hughes medical institute grant literally came back to work in his lab after several days and all these students had refused to leave the lab they had food they had packed they were in the lab working and they saw the work not as schoolwork but as their lives they knew they were working on aids research they were looking at this amazing protein design and what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work and he said it doesn 't get any better than that and then finally if you 've got the community and you 've got the high expectations and you 've got researchers producing researchers you have to have people who are willing even in the classroom i 'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying i 've got this young man in class a young black guy and he seems like he 's just we need to talk to him what was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student to understand who was really involved and who was not and was saying let me see how i can work with them let me get the staff to help me out it was that connecting that young man today is actually a faculty member give him a big hand for that and so the significance is that we have now developed this model that is helping us not only finally with evaluation assessing what works and what because so many students are bored in class do you know that many students k 12 and in universities don 't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk they need to be engaged and so we have done if you look at our website at the chemistry discovery center using problems out of our more and more courses in teacher education you can do this work if a student has a sense of self i kept thinking i wonder what my future could be i had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in birmingham to one day be president where they dreams and values thank you all very much"
