  "transcript": "after two days here i declare myself boggled and enormously impressed you are one of the great hopes not just for american achievement in science and technology but for the whole world however on a special mission on behalf of a million trillion insects and other small creatures and to if we were to wipe out insects alone just that group alone this planet which we are trying hard to do the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land and within a few months now how did i come to this particular position of advocacy as a little boy i became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life a fish period a cave period and finally and definitively an i was but my attention and research continued to make journeys across the great variety of life on earth in general including all that it means to how little we understand it and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it out of that broader study crystallized in the wish that i 'm about to make to you my choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the gulf coast of alabama on the florida peninsula as far back as i can remember i was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there i pulled a pinfish they 're called possibly congenitally in the upper registers so in planning to be a professional naturalist i never considered anything else in my entire life i found that i was lousy at bird watching i turned to the teeming small creatures that can be held between the the little things that compose the foundation who run the world in so doing reached a frontier of biology so strange so rich that it seemed as though it exists on another planet in fact we live on a mostly unexplored planet the great majority of organisms on earth remain unknown to science in the thirty years thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology biologists have for added a full one third of the known frog and other amphibian species to bring the current total to five thousand four hundred and more continue to pour in two new kinds of whales have been discovered along with two new antelopes at the extreme opposite end of the the class of marine bacteria the prochlorococci that will be on the are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on earth and moreover responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean these bacteria were not uncovered sooner because they are also among the smallest earth 's organisms so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures consider the fungi including mushrooms rusts molds and many organisms four out of five animals on earth are nematode worms if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms about sixteen thousand species of nematode worms have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists there could be even millions still unknown this vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further by the dark matter of the biological world which within just the last several years still were known from only about six thousand species of bacteria but that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil ten billion bacteria that would be there it 's been estimated that a single ton of soil fertile soil contains approximately four million species of bacteria all the question is what are they all doing fact is we don 't know we are living on a planet with done by faith and guess alone our lives depend upon these creatures to take an example close to home five hundred species of bacteria now known friendly bacteria living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria at this point i think we have a little impressionistic film that was made especially for assisted in this by billie holiday the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology a world unto themselves the variety of genes on the planet or is likely to exceed that in all of the rest of life combined in addressing microbial biodiversity scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched but that is changing rapidly with the aid of new already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices what will we find as we map the living world as we move past the relatively gigantic to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity already what were thought to be bacteria for generations have been found to true bacteria and one celled organisms the archaea which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota the group that we belong to and i count myself among them have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms one might just might they 've had we do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature and other harsh changes in environment including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the pyrex vessels around the growing population of bacteria there may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities hardly worth distinguishing one from the other but each of these species even the tiniest prochlorococci are masterpieces of evolution each has persisted for thousands to millions of years each is exquisitely adapted interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend in ways we have not begun even to imagine we will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them at the peril of our own existence and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy my own epiphany as a conservationist came while a harvard graduate student searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of cuba ants that shine in the but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native cuban forests hung on and were then and still are being cut back i realized then that these species and a large part of the other unique marvelous animals and plants on that island and this is true of practically every part of the world which took millions of years to evolve are in the process of disappearing forever and so it is everywhere one looks the human juggernaut is permanently eroding earth 's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym hippo i broom grasses and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country and at the second is for continued population human population expansion and the final letter is the hippo juggernaut we have created if unabated is destined according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research to reduce half of earth 's still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century a quarter of surviving species what will we and all future generations lose if much of the living environment huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered much of our environmental stability and new kinds of pharmaceuticals the loss will inflict a heavy price security because previous cataclysms of this kind the last one that ended the age of dinosaurs sadly our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it the two hundred thousand species known currently found to be only partial in coverage it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology only about fifteen percent of the known species have been studied well enough twenty percent flying blind into our environmental future we urgently need to change this we need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it we need to settle down before we wreck the and we need that knowledge this should be a big science project equivalent to the human genome project it should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable i wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of earth 's biodiversity and let us call it the encyclopedia of life what is the encyclopedia of life a concept that has already taken hold and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously it is an encyclopedia that lives on the internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world amateurs can do it also it has an indefinitely expandable page for each species it makes all key information about life on earth accessible i 've written about this idea before and i know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it but what excites me is that since i first put forward the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it are within reach indeed in the past a group of influential scientific institutions working together we can make this real to spread and"
