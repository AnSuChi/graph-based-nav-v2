  "transcript": "make decisions every day we want to know what the right thing is to do in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic and surely if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times that would be a tremendous gift the world was given this gift in by a dutch polymath named daniel bernoulli and it 's greek but it captures the gist of what bernoulli had to say was this the expected value of any of our actions that is the goodness that we can count on getting is the product of two simple things the odds that this action will allow us to gain something and the value of that gain to us in a sense but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me most of you would say sure i 'll take that bet because you know that the odds of you winning are one half the gain if you do is ten dollars that multiplies to five everyday life people are horrible at estimating both of these things and that 's what i want to talk to you about today there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do and those are errors in estimating the odds that they 're going to succeed and errors in estimating the value of their own success now lose more gambling than on the reason is this isn 't how people do odds the way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs now the question i 'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in oxford and of course you all know that the answer is dogs and the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you 've seen dogs and pigs on leashes it was very easy to remember seeing dogs not so easy to remember pigs and each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind then dogs on leashes are more probable except when it is so for example here 's a word puzzle are there more four letter english words with r in the third place or r in the first place well you check memory the reason words with r in the third place come slowly to your mind isn 't because they 're improbable unlikely or infrequent it 's because you kind of shout out the sound s and the word comes it 's like the dictionary it 's hard to look things up by the third letter it 's not just puzzles though for example americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways these are estimates of number of deaths per year per two hundred million u s citizens and these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado fireworks asthma drowning etc why when was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was boy dies of asthma it 's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we 've seen tornadoes devastating cities or some poor schmuck who 's blown his hands off with a firework on the fourth of july this is kind of like the sesame street game of which thing doesn 't belong and you 're right to say it 's the swimming pool that doesn 't belong because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that 's actually very dangerous the way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide slide the lottery is an excellent example of course an excellent test case of people 's ability to compute probabilities and economists forgive me for those of you who play the lottery but economists at least among themselves refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet which by the way doesn 't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything right when this couple wins the when was the last time that you saw if we required that television stations run a 30 second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner the one hundred million losers in the last lottery would require nine and a half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say and you saw loss after loss after loss and then at the end there 's thirty seconds of and i won the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small look i can prove this to you here 's a little lottery well bernoulli tells us it is the expected value of this lottery is two dollars but it 's now fantastically easy to imagine who 's going to win it 's easy to see leroy getting the check right you can 't say to yourself i 'm as likely to win as anybody because you 're not as likely to win as leroy estimating odds as difficult as it may seem is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate trying to say what something is worth how much we 'll enjoy it how much pleasure it will give us most of you have the intuition that it 's not you wouldn 't pay that for it but in fact to decide whether a big mac is worth twenty five dollars requires that you ask one and only one question which is what australia and realized that they 're not going to serve you any food but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the mcdonald 's bag and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat you think suddenly twenty five dollars for a big mac it 's exorbitant for a big mac why were you all sure because most of you compared the price of this big mac to the price you 're used to paying rather than asking what else can i do with my money comparing this investment to other possible investments you compared to the past and this is a systematic error people make what you knew this is of course one of the most delicious tricks in marketing is to say something used to be higher and suddenly it seems like a very good deal when people are asked about these two different jobs and one in which you 're getting a salary increase people like the second job better than the first despite the fact they 're all told they make much less money why because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period here 's a slightly different story $ two thousand hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for seven hundred dollars so you decide to mull it over for a week by the time you get to the ticket agency the best fares are gone the package now costs one thousand five hundred would you buy it most this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal in other words a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal here 's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle you also have a 20 dollar bill most people answer no let 's just change one thing in this scenario you 're on your way to the theater and in here 's a schematic of what happened ok along the way you lost something in both cases it was a piece of paper in one case it had a u s president on it in the other case the difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself i 'm not paying twice for the same thing you compare the cost of the play now forty dollars to the cost that it used to have twenty dollars and you say it 's a bad deal but even when we compare with the possible instead of the past we still make certain kinds of mistakes and i 'm going to show you one or two of them one of the things we know about comparison that when we compare one thing to the other it changes its value so in one thousand nine this fellow george bush for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum didn 't seem like such a great guy suddenly we 're almost longing for him to return retailers knew this long before anybody else did of course and they use this wisdom to help you and so a retailer if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine and you see them here for eight twenty seven and thirty three dollars what would you do most people don 't want the most expensive they don 't want the least expensive so they will opt for the item in if you 're a smart retailer then you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf because suddenly the $ thirty three wine doesn 't look as expensive it won 't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to the comparisons we make when we are appraising value we 're trying to estimate how much we 'll like things are not the same comparisons we 'll be making when we consume them i have to show you something from my own lab so let me sneak this in these are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions how much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now they 're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them for some of the subjects sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of godiva chocolates and for others is a can of spam these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they 're going to enjoy the potato chips namely those who are looking at spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty well look you didn 't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy salty crispy delicious snacks what 's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience you 've all experienced this yourself even if you 've never come into our lab to eat potato chips so here 's a question you want to buy a car stereo the dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for two hundred dollars but if you drive across town you can get it for one hundred bucks so would you drive to let 's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo and the dealer near your house had it for thirty one thousand but if you drove across town you could get it for thirty thousand nine hundred most people say no i 'm going to schlep across town to save one hundred bucks on the purchase of a car this kind of thinking drives economists crazy and it should because this one hundred dollars that you save hello doesn 't know where it came from it doesn 't know what you saved it on when you go to buy groceries with it it doesn 't go i 'm the money saved it 's money and if a drive across town is worth one hundred bucks it 's worth one hundred bucks no matter what you 're saving because what you 're doing is you 're comparing the one hundred bucks to the purchase that you 're making but when you go to spend that money you won 't be making that comparison if you 're an american for example you 've probably traveled in france and at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown and you thought oh my god i mean compared to all these people who hate me when i try to speak their language and hate me more when i don 't these people are just wonderful and so you tour france with them and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner and what do you find the comparison is very very different in fact you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for french citizenship now you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo you go to the stereo store you see two sets of speakers these big and these little sleek speakers and you play them and you go you know i do hear a difference the big ones sound a little better and so you buy them and you bring them home and you entirely violate the dcor of your house what are the odds that years later you 'll turn on the stereo and the problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time and what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules you can have what 's hard in our decision making is when these two they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification maybe that isn 't so remarkable but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away imagine that you can have fifty dollars in a year that 's twelve months or sixty dollars in thirteen people are gladly willing to wait as long as they 're waiting twelve they might as well wait thirteen what makes this dynamic inconsistency happen comparison troubling comparison let me show you this is just a graph showing the results that i just suggested you would show if i gave you time to respond which is people find that the subjective value of fifty is higher than the subjective value of sixty when they 'll be delivered in now or one month respectively a 30 day delay but they show the reverse pattern what you see here are two lads one of them larger than the other the fireman and the fiddler they are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon and i want you to notice two things at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler the difference between them seems to be getting smaller first it 's an inch in your view then it 's a this is the subjective height the height you saw of these guys at various points and i want you to see that two things are true one the farther away they are the smaller they look right what space is to size time is to value these are the results of the hard problem i gave you people always think more is better than less sixty is always better than fifty and they always think now is better than later the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side watch what happens when we drop some out but not if that decision is far in the future notice something interesting that this implies the question with which i 'd like to end is this if we 're so damn stupid how did we get to the moon because i could go on for about two hours with evidence of people 's inability to the answer to this question i think is an answer you 've already heard in some of the talks and i dare say you will hear again namely that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living they were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today allows us it tells us how we should think that explains why we are so bad at using it but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good fast we are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate we have no significant predators we 're the masters of our physical environment the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us the only thing the only thing that can destroy us and doom us our own decisions if we 're not here in ten thousand years it 's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young dutch fellow in one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually to frighten us and is there some way that we could counteract that dan gilbert i actually was consulting recently with the department of homeland security which generally believes that american security dollars should go to making borders safer i tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people 's psychological reaction to a set of events but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we 're all concerned about surely the kinds of play that at least american media give to and forgive me but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents we already know plague that was going to kill fifteen thousand americans next year you might be alarmed if you didn 't find out it was the flu these are small scale accidents and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play the kind of coverage that they do surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they 'll be hurt if australia disappears tomorrow terror is probably the right response that 's an awful large lot of very nice people on the other hand when a bus blows up and thirty people are killed more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country is terror the right response ca what causes the bug outsiders what is it dg yes it 's a number of things and you hit on several of them first it 's a human agent trying to kill us it 's not a tree falling on us by accident second these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again people are being killed for no reason instead of good reason as if there 's good reason but sometimes people think there are so there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event but let 's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read so there 's a large role here played by the media who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can ca i mean you know go to israel and a mall blows up and then everybody 's unhappy about it and an hour and a half later at least when i was there and i was one hundred and fifty feet from the mall when it blew up i went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on and as the israeli mother said she said we never let them win by stopping stopping weddings i mean this is a society that has learned and there are others too that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it so if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be there might be more and more buses of thirty people we would probably not be nearly so frightened i don 't want to say please i 'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying terrorism is fine and we surely rationally our distress about things that happen about threats should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and i think in the case of terrorism it isn 't i can 't believe what poverty is doing get up in the morning they don 't care about poverty it 's not making headlines it 's not making news it 's not flashy there are no guns going off i mean if you had to solve one of these problems chris which would you solve terrorism or poverty you know terrorists with a nuke are are really likely to come the latest i 've read seen thought is that it 's incredibly incredibly hard for them to do that if that turns out to be wrong we all look silly but still more people die from poverty ca we 've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks we just didn 't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth and so it made no sense for us as as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things people died so be it but if you got attacked that was something you could do something about and so we we evolved these responses is that what happened dg well you know the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary my guess is that there 's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past but rather if you 're looking for an evolutionary explanation you might say that most organisms are neo phobic that is they 're a little scared of stuff that 's new and different and there 's a good reason to be because old stuff didn 't eat you right any animal you see that you 've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you 've never seen before so you know when a school bus is blown up and we 've never seen this before our general tendency is to orient towards that which that which is new and novel is activated i don 't think it 's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it flushing the money directly down the toilet which so would you drive to"
