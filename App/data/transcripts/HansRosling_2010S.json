  "transcript": "and that was in one thousand nine hundred and sixty launching a brand new analog teaching technology that i picked up from ikea and they lived away then there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world in the industrialized world people and in one thousand nine hundred and sixty all swedes were saving to try to buy a volvo like this far away the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day they were saving able to buy a pair of shoes there was an enormous gap in the world when i grew up and this gap between the west and the rest has created a mindset of the world which we still use linguistically when we talk about the west and the developing world but the world and it 's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world and to understand it and that 's what i 'm going to show you because since one thousand nine hundred and sixty what has happened in the world up to two thousand and ten is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population just look how many the world population has doubled since i went to school and of course economic growth in the west a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy so the western population moved over to here and now their aspiration is not only to have a car now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly and the most successful of the developing and then finally the swedes understood that something big had happened in the world so there they are and the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes they are still almost as poor as they were fifty years ago as those but no longer any gap but there is a continuous world from walking i 'm going to project into two thousand and fifty and i listened to what 's happening in china and it 's pretty sure that they will catch up just as japan did and these and energy can still be relatively cheap this is what we what we will find there so what about the poorest two billion what about the poorest two billion here so these [ poorest ] two billion will in the next decades increase to three billion and they will thereafter there is nothing but a nuclear war of a kind we 've never seen that can stop this then population growth will stop in two thousand and fifty we cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth and let me show you why by converting back to the old time digital technology brown is europe green is here i have children per woman two children four children six children eight children big families eighty percent ninety and as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries but look this is the world my teacher talked about in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one billion western world here high small families and all the rest the rainbow of developing countries with very large families and poor child survival what has happened i start the world here we go can you see as the years pass by child survival is increasing they get soap hygiene education then families decrease and most of the arab countries in the middle east is falling down there [ to small families ] look bangladesh catching up with india the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and and they still have a child survival of only seventy to eighty percent meaning that if you have six children born only way of really getting world population [ growth ] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to ninety percent that 's why investments by gates foundation unicef and aid organizations together with national government in the poorest countries are so good because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world we can stop at nine billion if we do the right things and will it happen well i 'm not an optimist neither am i a pessimist i 'm a very serious possibilist it can be done we can have a much more just world with green technology and global governance the world can become like this leading the world living its own life this will not happen [ again ] the role of the old west in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world but it 's a very important role do it well and get used to it thank you very much"
