  "transcript": "i never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention at the beginning i was just looking for a wall in my hometown and it happened that the minaret was built in ' ninety four and for eighteen years those of concrete stayed grey and i told him what i wanted to do he was like thank god you finally came and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it the most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn 't ask me anything neither a sketch or what i was going to write i write messages with my style of calligraffiti a mix of calligraphy and graffiti i use quotes or poetry for the minaret i thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the quran so i picked this verse and made you people and tribe so you may know each other and acceptance coming from the side that i was amazed and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the for the imam it was not just the painting it was really deeper than that and attract people to this forgotten place of tunisia and the fact that i was writing quran together through arabic calligraphy is what i do writing messages is the essence of my artwork what is funny actually is that people really need to focus a lot to decipher what i 'm writing there is a beauty in it that you don 't need to translate and then when you get the meaning but messages that have and i started learning today i only one of the reasons this is so important to me is because of all the reaction that i 've experienced all around the world i translated this portuguese poem from gabriela trres barbosa who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela and then i painted it on the rooftop in south africa in cape town the local community of philippi offered me the only it seems impossible until it 's done then this guy came to me and said man why you don 't write in english and i replied to him i would consider your concern legit if you asked me why i didn 't write in zulu in paris once there was this event and someone gave his wall to be painted and when he saw and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy 's house so this guy like was forced to see it every and i hope that i can break the stereotypes we all know with the beauty of arabic script today i don 't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall i don 't want the poetry but for me it 's more thank you"
