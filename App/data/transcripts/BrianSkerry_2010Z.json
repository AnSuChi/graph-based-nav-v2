  "transcript": "like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for national geographic magazine and i wanted tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater and after even thirty years of doing this after thirty years of exploring the ocean i never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that i have while i 'm at sea but more and more frequently these days i 'm seeing terrible things underwater as the first story that i did for national geographic where i recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage was a story i proposed on harp seals the story i wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down and because i 'm an underwater photographer i wanted to do this story from both above and below to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first but as i got more involved in the story i realized that there were two big environmental issues i couldn 't ignore the first was that these animals continue to be hunted but as disturbing as that is i think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming this is an aerial picture that i made that shows the gulf of during harp seal season and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture there 's a lot of water as well which wasn 't there historically and the ice that is there is quite thin they only need twelve days from the moment they 're born until they 're on their own but if they don 't get twelve days they can fall into the ocean this is a photo that i made showing one of these pups that 's only about five or seven days old still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly that has fallen in because of the thin ice and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there i read that last year the pup mortality rate was one hundred percent in parts of the gulf of st lawrence so clearly this species has a lot of problems this ended up becoming a cover story at national geographic and it received quite a bit of attention so i proposed a story on the global fish crisis in part because i had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last thirty years but also because i read a scientific paper these are the the billfish and the sharks but it really wasn 't so i wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story i wanted it to be more like war photography where i was making harder hitting pictures that showed people go into a restaurant and somebody orders a steak and we all know where steak comes from and somebody orders a chicken and we know what a chicken is but when they 're eating bluefin sushi do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they 're consuming these are the lions and tigers of the sea in reality these animals have no terrestrial counterpart they 're unique in the world these are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a this is the daily auction at the tsukiji fish market that i photographed a couple years ago and bluefin like this are stacked up like cordwood i also with the story wanted to show readers how fish are caught some of the methods that are used to catch fish like a bottom trawler which is one of the most common methods in the world this was a small net that was being used in mexico to catch shrimp but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world you have a a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end and as this assembly is towed through the water the doors meet resistance with the ocean and it opens the mouth of the net and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom and this just drags and it 's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom things like sponges and corals critical habitat for other animals this photograph i made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner maybe seven or eight shrimp and to make that point even more pufferfish that only an hour before were on the bottom of the ocean alive but now being thrown back as trash i also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet earth we 're killing over one hundred million sharks but before i went out to photograph this component i sort of wrestled with notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers you know i think there 's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark and with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible it struck me as sort of a crucifixion if you will this ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in national geographic and i hope that it helped readers to take notice and because i love sharks i 'm somewhat obsessed with sharks i wanted to do another more celebratory story about sharks as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation so i went to the bahamas because show several species that we hadn 't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations one of the locations was this place called tiger beach in the northern bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water this is a low altitude photograph that i made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind but the one thing i definitely didn 't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters i didn 't want and with this photograph of a beautiful i guess female tiger shark i sort of think i got to that goal where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose and my strobe created a shadow on her face and i think it 's a gentler picture a little less threatening a little more respectful of the species i also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead an animal that really hadn 't been photographed much until maybe about seven or ten years ago it 's a very solitary creature but this is an animal that 's considered data deficient by science in both florida and in the bahamas you know we know almost nothing about them we don 't know where they migrate to or from where they mate where they have their pups and yet hammerhead populations in the atlantic have declined about eighty percent in the last twenty to thirty years you know we 're losing them faster than we can possibly find them the oceanic whitetip shark an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species if you pay attention to such lists but it 's an animal that 's about ninety eight percent in decline throughout most and because we weren 't working on the bottom i brought along this is a photo of a lemon shark pup and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves it 's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture but you know here we see a shark that 's maybe ten or eleven inches long swimming in about a foot of water but this is crucial habitat and it 's where they spend the first two three years of their lives until they 're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef after i left bimini i actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort and other recent stories have flagship species if you will that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats one such story i did documented the leatherback sea turtle this is the largest and oldest of all turtle species here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of trinidad and there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw tyrannosaurus rex this is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity but that 's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore nature has learned to compensate with that and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds but what they can 't deal with is anthropogenic stresses human things like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net i actually jumped in and photographed this and with the fisherman 's permission the turtle out and it was able to swim free but you know thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate and the species ' future is in great danger and essentially the story is this with right whales that about a million years ago there was one species of right but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated the species sort of separated and today we have essentially two distinct stocks we have the southern right whale that we see here and the north atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of florida now but the southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they 're located in places farther away from human activity the north atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales live along the east coast of north america united states and canada and they have to deal with all these urban ills this photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of florida you can see the coal burning plant in the background they have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean and maybe even affecting their reproduction they also get entangled in fishing but most don 't shed the gear things like lobster traps and crab pots they hold on to them and it eventually kills them against these animals and keeping their numbers very low and to draw a contrast with that beleaguered north atlantic population i went to a new pristine population of southern right whales that had only been discovered about ten years ago in the sub antarctic of new zealand a place called the auckland islands i went down there in the winter time and i was one of the first people they i got in the water with them and i was amazed at how curious they were this photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about seventy feet and one of these amazingly beautiful the way they 're supposed to look you know i read that the pilgrims when they landed at plymouth rock in massachusetts in one thousand six hundred and and i wanted to close this program with a story of hope a story i did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing the global fish crisis story i settled on working in the country of new zealand because new zealand was rather progressive and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean and i really wanted this story to be about three things i wanted it to be about abundance resilience and one of the first places i worked was a reserve called goat island in leigh of new zealand what the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five they hoped and expected that certain things might happen for example they hoped that certain species of fish like the new zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction and they did come back what they couldn 't predict was that other things would happen for example these fish predate on sea urchins and when the fish were all gone all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population low and behold and that 's because the urchins eat kelp so when the fish control the urchin population the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium you know this is probably how the ocean looked here one or two hundred years ago but nobody was around to tell us i worked in other parts of new zealand as well in beautiful fragile protected areas like in fiordland where this sea pen colony was found little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color i dove in the blue water where the water 's a little warmer and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy from tiny little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge and i wanted to finish with this photograph a picture i made on a very stormy day in new zealand when i just laid on the bottom amidst a school and i talked to divers that had been diving there for many years and they said that the marine life was better here today"
