  "transcript": "they have interest sniffing each other and if we don 't make that a reward in training that will be a distraction it 's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that come here and the dog thinks hmm interesting i 'm sniffing this other dog 's rear end you cannot compete with the environment if you have an adolescent dog 's brain brain so when we train we 're always trying to take into account the dog 's point of view i 'm here largely because there 's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that on one side we have people who think that you train a dog number one by making up rules damn it we 're going to when he was a little puppy he puts his paws on your leg you reward him for jumping up eighty pounds i mean it is really very very scary the abuse that dogs get so this whole dominance issue number one what we get in dog training is this male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy because it prevents physical fights of course female dogs bitches on the other hand have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule the number one is i have it you don 't and what you will find is a very very will quite easily keep a bone away from a high ranking male so we get in dog training this notion of dominances or of the alpha dog i 'm sure that you 've heard this dogs get so abused and the reason is built into their behavior is to always come back and apologize like oh i 'm sorry you had to beat me i 'm really it 's my fault they are just so beatable and that 's why they get beaten squirt him in the face with lemon juice hit him on the head with a rolled up newspaper knee him in the chest flip him over backwards i could speak to you and say swahili well i 've got news for you the dog doesn 't speak english so the first stage in training is to teach the dog esl english as a second language and that 's how we use the food lure my wife doesn 't need food she 's a they 're making a hand signal in front of the dog 's rectum for some reason like the dog has a third eye there it 's insane you know and you can actually and the name of my son jamie come in for dinner so at this point the dog knows what we want it to do will it do it necessarily no as i said if he 's in the park and there 's a rear end to sniff why come to the owner the dog lives with you so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do high frequency behavior commonly known as a behavior problem or a dog hobby something the dog does like to do that will then become a reward for the so now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training and what we 're doing in essence is we 're teaching the dog kind of like and i can imagine this dog you know speaking through the fence to say an akita saying owners they are so incredibly easy to train they 're like golden retrievers all i have to do is sit and they do everything they open doors that 's my command then i have my own personal doorman chauffeur such that the need for punishment seldom comes up now we move to phase three when now there 's times you know when daddy knows best and i have a little sign on my fridge and it says because i 'm the daddy that 's why you 're not sit and there 's times for example if my son 's friends leave the door open the dogs have to know you don 't step across this line this is a life or death thing and you could be hit on the street so some things we have to let the dog know you mustn 't do this and so we have to enforce but without force people here get very it doesn 't have to be such that it 's less likely to occur in the future if it doesn 't have to be then maybe it shouldn 't be and i only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house and they never took it outside and he was kept there by the owner 's calm insistence when the dog would try to leave the mat she would say rover on the mat on the mat the dog broke his down stay twenty two times in four and a half hours while she cooked dinner you see the punishment was working the behavior problem was going away she never raised her voice if she did she would have got bitten it 's not a good dog you shout at and a lot of my friends train really neat animals if you 've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film then it 's a friend of mine who 's trained it killer whales how are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear bad bear bad bear voom ok this is crazy so where do we go we want a better way dogs deserve better but for me the reason for this actually has to do with dogs it has to do with watching people train puppies and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills but with the rest of the family at class i mean my all time classic is another come here one you see someone in the park and i 'll cover my mic when i say this because i and there 's the owner in the park and their dog 's over here and they say and it really cemented what i wanted to do with this whole puppy training thing the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog friendly way to want to do what we want to do so we don 't have to force them you know was getting on a plane in dallas and in row two was a father i presume and a young boy about five kicking the back of the chair the father leans over grabs him like this and gives him ugly face and ugly face is this when you go with a puppy or a child you say that child has lost everything walk on i walked to the back of the plane if that had been a dog i would if he had kicked a dog i would have punched him out and this is what it 's all about we as humans our you know kind of like a little robot this is how we go into a relationship no different from the dog barking and we get into this thing and our personal feedback when you watch people interacting with animals or other people there is very little you see it 's especially in families it 's as if there 's some schadenfreude there that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong and this i would say is the biggest human and i think this whole notion of these skills should be taught you know calculus is wonderful when i was a kid i was a calculus whiz i don 't understand a thing about it now but i could do it as a kid geometry fantastic you know quantum mechanics these are cool things but they don 't save marriages and they don 't raise children"
