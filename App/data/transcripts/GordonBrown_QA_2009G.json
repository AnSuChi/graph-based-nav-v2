  "transcript": "would you describe that as global citizenship is that an idea that you believe in and how would you define that gordon brown it is about global citizenship and recognizing our responsibilities to others there is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world but we don necessarily have the means means to do so so there are challenges to be met but of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work but i don 't think we should underestimate the extent to which massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people of people across the world about this idea of global citizenship but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism and how to combine these two i mean you 're elected as prime minister with a brief to bat for britain how do you reconcile the two things gb and i think problems of recession is that people become they try to protect their own nation perhaps it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries and any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years would deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits of growth in the world economy so but what do you do when the two come into conflict and you 're forced to make a decision that either is in britain 's interest or the interest of britons or citizens elsewhere in the world gb well i think we can persuade people that that what is necessary for for britain 's long term interests what is necessary for america 's long term interests is proper engagement with the rest of the world and taking the action that is richard nixon goes to represent the united states government at the celebrations for independence in ghana and it 's one of his first outings as vice president to an african country he doesn 't quite know what to do so he starts going around the crowd and and he says to people in this rather unique way i come from alabama remarkable is socioeconomic rights in africa have not moved forward very fast even since the age of america and africa have got a common interest and we have got to realize that if we don 't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in africa to together for common causes then the danger of al qaeda and related groups making progress in africa is very big so i would say that what seems sometimes to be altruism in relation to africa or in relation to developing countries and i would say that national interest and if you like what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change do and whatever the short run price for taking action on climate change or on security or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries comes through that there 's been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach one end of the beach there is a house and at the other end of the beach you have time to you have time to to alert one house what do you do i do agree that that my responsibility is first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe and i wouldn 't like anything that is said today to suggest that i am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that but i 'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before but the power to communicate across borders allows us to organize the world in a different way where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes as well as the potential for climate change i just think we 're not seeing at the moment the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems ca but i think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot of people have like people in the audience here where we love it is inspiring a lot of us believe that that has to be the world 's future the life of one american soldier is worth countless numbers of i 'm just wondering whether you can see that changing over time whether you see in britain that there are changing attitudes and that people are actually more supportive of the of the kind of global ethic that you talk about gb i think every religion and whether it 's jewish or whether it 's muslim or whether it 's hindu or whether it 's sikh the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these i think you 're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of their moral sense so you 're building on something that is not pure you 're building on people 's ideas and values that perhaps they 're candles that but it is a set set of values that cannot in my view be extinguished then the question is how do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong the imf the world bank the world trade organization the marshall plan there was a period in which people talked about an act of creation because these institutions were so new but they are now out of date they don 't deal with the problems you can 't deal with the environmental problem through existing institutions you can 't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to you can 't deal with the economic and financial problem so we have got to rebuild our global institutions build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time and i believe that if you if you look at the biggest challenge we face it is to persuade people to have the confidence that we can build nobody would have said fifty years ago that apartheid would have gone in one thousand nine hundred and ninety or that the berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the ' 80s and ' 90s or that polio could be eradicated or perhaps sixty years ago nobody would have said a man could gone to the moon all these things have happened by tackling the impossible you make the impossible possible ca and we have had a is for someone to say i believe that the life of every human on the planet is worth the same equal consideration regardless of nationality and you have politicians who have you 're elected in a way you can 't say that even if as a human being you believe that you can 't say that you 're elected for britain 's interests gb we have a responsibility to protect i mean look one thousand nine hundred and eighteen and all the treaties before that the treaty of westphalia and everything else were about protecting the sovereign right of countries to do what they want since then the world has moved forward partly as a result of what happened with the holocaust and people 's concern about the rights of individuals within territories partly because of what we saw in bosnia the idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world to the aid of any citizen of any country in danger i can say that britain is in a position where we 're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack is something that is accepted by the whole world now in the end that can only be achieved if your international institutions work well enough to be able to to do so and what it can do actually is but the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is in a sense taken over from the idea as the principle governing the international community ca can you picture in our lifetimes a politician ever going out on a platform of the kind of i believe that that all and we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that ethic gb that not what we 're doing in the debate about climate change we 're saying you 're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we 're all bound together to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world we 've never had this before because kyoto didn 't work if you could get a deal at copenhagen long term target for carbon emission cuts b that there was short range targets that had to be met so this wasn 't just abstract it was people actually making decisions and if you could then find a financing mechanism that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt by our inability to deal with climate change over many many years and decades that they can move to energy efficient technologies and they are in a position financially to be able to afford the long term investment that is associated with cutting carbon emissions then you are treating the world equally by giving consideration to every part of the of the planet and the needs they have it doesn 't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing because we 've actually got to do more financially to help the poorest but it does mean there is equal consideration for for the needs of citizens in in a single planet ca yes and then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own i mean the great difficulty in europe is if if you 're at a meeting and but we did get an agreement on climate change america has made its first disposition on this with the bill that president obama should be congratulated for for getting through congress japan has made an announcement china and india have signed up to the scientific evidence but more progress has been made i think in the last few weeks than had been made for some years and i do i certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific and we would help them adapt and i do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this when the imf was created in the 1940s so we 've got to rebuild rebuild the world a big task persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so there is a story told about the three world leaders of the day getting a chance to get some some advice from god and the story is told that bill clinton went to god and he asked when there will be successful climate change and a and god shook his head and said not this year not this decade perhaps not even in [ your ] lifetime and bill clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted and then the story is that barroso the president of the european commission went to god and he asked when will we get a recovery of global god said not this year not in this decade perhaps not not in your of the united nations came up to speak to god and said when will our international institutions work and god cried it is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions is the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves that there is a clear ethic upon which we can build ca prime minister i think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into thank you so much for coming to ted"
