  "transcript": "the best part of last year working on a documentary about my own happiness like i can train my body so i can end up with an improved feeling of and pursuing a film like that just after years worth of work pretty much all i have to show for it are the titles for the film music they were still done when i was on sabbatical with my company much more fitting way fashion my studio in bali was only ten minutes away from a monkey forest and monkeys of course are supposed to be the happiest of all animals so we trained them to be able to do three separate words to lay out them properly you can see there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there the serif is not really in place what you don 't do properly yourself is never deemed done really so this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the sayan valley in indonesia and it turns out that men and women report very very similar levels of happiness this is a very quick overview of all the studies that i looked at that climate plays no role that if you live in the best climate in san diego in the united states or in the shittiest climate in buffalo new york bucks a year in the u s any salary increase you 're going to experience will have only a tiny tiny influence on your overall well being black people are just as happy as white people are good looking it makes no difference whatsoever you will adapt to it and get used to it if you have manageable health problems so now the woman on the right is actually much happier than the guy on the left meaning that if you have a lot of friends and you have meaningful friendships that does make a lot of difference as well as being married you are likely to be much happier than if you are single a fellow ted speaker jonathan haidt came up with this beautiful little analogy between the conscious and the unconscious mind he says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider on this giant elephant the unconscious but the elephant really has his own ideas if i would have been born a hundred years earlier the big decisions in my life would have been made for me meaning i would have stayed in the town that i was born in and i would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected very much in charge of these big decisions in our lives we live where we want to be at least in the west and so it 's quite surprising that many of us let our unconscious influence those decisions in ways that we are not quite aware of when he decides on where he wants to live is it florida or north dakota when he decides what to become is it a or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher and so even if we make those very important decisions it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas who are married to paul than statistically viable now i of course thought well this is they get influenced by things that they 're not aware of this is just completely ridiculous my mom and my dad and grandmom and granddad josefine so i am looking still for a stephanie i 'll figure something out if i make this whole thing a little bit more personal and see what makes me happy as a designer the easiest answer of course is do more of the stuff that i like to do and much less of the stuff that i don 't like to do for which it would be helpful to know what it is that i actually do like to do so i came up with a list one of them is to think without pressure this is a project we 're working on right now with a very healthy deadline doing things like i 'm doing right now traveling to cannes the example i have here is a chair that came out of the year in bali clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture not being stuck behind a single computer screen all day long quite consciously design projects that need an incredible amount of various techniques just basically to fight straightforward adaptation being close to the content that 's the content really is close to my heart this is a bus or vehicle for a charity for an ngo that wants to double the education budget in the united states carefully designed so by two inches it still clears highway overpasses having end results things that come back from the printer well like this little business card for an animation company called sideshow on lenticular foils working on projects that actually have visible impacts like a book for a deceased german artist widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous it just came out six months ago and it 's getting unbelievable and i think that his widow is going to be very successful on her quest but i didn 't quite know all that much but also because the content was very close in this case keeping a diary supports personal and i 've found that it influenced my life and work in this case also because it one of the many sentiments that we build the whole series on that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary thank you so much"
