  "transcript": "this it 's how computers do it is that computers do now as exciting as that sounds when i first started doing cyber when i first started doing cyber i wasn 't sure that sifting through ones and zeros was what i wanted to do with the rest of my life it was keeping someone 's credit card information from being stolen but that 's not how i wanted to spend my life but after thirty minutes of work as a defense contractor i soon found out that my idea of cyber was a little bit off keeping viruses off of my grandma 's computer was surprisingly low on their priority list and the reason for that is cyber is so much bigger than any one of those things because computers are an integral part of all of our lives even if you don 't own a computer clean water food computers control our military equipment everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks all of these things are made possible but once in a while part of my job is to break one of these things we 're entering an age where we talk about cyberweapons it 's not necessarily a bad thing it means we have whole new front on which we need to defend ourselves it means we have a whole new way to attack a whole new way to stop evil people from doing evil things let 's consider an example of this that 's completely theoretical suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building and he wants to do this again and again it used to be the only way we had to stop this terrorist we 're entering an because whether he knew it or not as soon as he decided to use his cell phone he stepped into the realm of cyber a well crafted cyber attack could break into his phone maybe no more terrorist all with the press of a binary information spending your life sifting through binary information starts to seem kind this is hard really really hard and here 's why think about everything you have on your cell phone you 've got the pictures you 've taken you 've got the music you listen to and behind all of this is the software the code that controls so let 's step back from this theoretical situation of making a terrorist 's phone explode and look at something that actually happened to me and i 'm always looking for one key piece to do something specific unfortunately for me i didn 't know quite what i was looking for i didn 't know quite what it would look like which makes finding it really try to decipher each piece and see if it might be what i 'm after so after a while i thought i had found the piece i was looking for i thought maybe this was it it seemed to be about right but i couldn 't quite tell i couldn 't tell what those ones and zeros represented i spent some and i 'm not going to leave until i figure out what this represents so that 's what i did i came in on a saturday morning and about ten hours in i sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle i just didn 't know how they fit together i didn 't know what these ones and zeros meant at the 15 hour mark but i had a creeping suspicion that what i was looking at was not at all related to what i was looking for by twenty hours the pieces started to come together very slowly i figured out exactly what i and i was right it wasn 't what i was looking for i spent thirty hours piecing together the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten i wasted thirty hours of my life so i was frustrated i was exhausted after thirty hours in the lab i probably smelled horrible but instead of just going home and calling it quits i took a step back and asked myself what went wrong here how could i make such a stupid mistake so what happened it 's so easy to lose track of what you 're doing it 's easy to not see the forest through the trees it 's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole but i had this epiphany we were looking at the data completely incorrectly since day one instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem we should have been making the problem fit our minds because our brains have a tremendous potential which looked pretty much the same the main difference is at work i 'm surrounded by cyber materials and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation i 'm surrounded by everything else i 've ever so i poured through every book i could find every idea i 'd ever encountered to see how could we translate a problem from one domain to something completely different the biggest question was what do we want to translate it to what do our brains do perfectly naturally that we could exploit my answer was vision we have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information we can combine color gradients depth cues all sorts of these different signals into one coherent picture of the world around us that 's incredible i don 't care what it does how it works all i want to know is what is this and the way i can figure that out is by looking at chunks and i look at the relationships between those chunks this is what your contacts list would look like it 's really hard to analyze this at this but show us it in an entirely days to pick them this is caused by spaces this is caused by carriage returns we can go through every little detail of the binary information in seconds this is what the code on your but this is its visual abstraction one of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information stuff that we haven 't seen before but i 've never seen russian binary in my entire life so this is what russian looks like in a visual i can recognize other languages even when i 'm not familiar with them but this is what the code on your computer looks like our brains can pick up on these patterns in ways that we never could have from looking at raw ones if we take those same concepts and translate them into three dimensions instead we find entirely new ways of making sense of information months to find in ones and zeroes are immediately apparent in some sort of visual abstraction and as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it what we find is that we 're capable of processing billions of ones and zeros in a matter of seconds just by using so this is really nice but all this tells me is so i might not be able to find the code that controls the battery but there 's a lot of things that are very similar to that you have code that controls your screen that controls your buttons that controls your microphones so even if i can 't find the code for the battery i follow these strands of similarity like a trail but that 's still not enough to blow up a phone for this i need to identify very subtle very detailed relationships within that binary information another very hard thing to do when looking at it can find all the detailed patterns all the important pieces this is all well and good in a theoretical blow up a terrorist 's phone situation i wanted to find out if this would really work so i was playing around with these same concepts with some of the data i 've so i looked at it thinking i was looking at the right thing only to see this doesn 't have the connectivity i would have expected for the code i was looking for this doesn 't have similarities like any code that exists out there i can 't even be looking at code this is an image of some sort shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking it was that darn kitten again so what does this mean it means no more wasted weekends it means we have a new weapon thank you"
