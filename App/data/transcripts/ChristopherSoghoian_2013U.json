  "transcript": "the two thousand and eleven arab spring captured the attention of the world it also captured the attention of authoritarian governments in other countries who were worried that revolution would spread to respond they ramped up surveillance of activists journalists and dissidents who they feared would inspire revolution in their own countries one prominent bahraini activist who was arrested and tortured by his government has said that the interrogators showed him transcripts of his telephone calls and text messages it 's for that reason that many activists specifically which they think are immune to interception they 're wrong there have now been over the last few years rather than intercepting the communications as they go over the wire instead they now when the government of egypt fell in two thousand and eleven activists raided the office of the secret police and among the many documents they found was this document by the gamma corporation by gamma international gamma is a german company that manufactures surveillance software and sells it only to governments it 's important to note that most governments don 't really have the in house capabilities to develop this software smaller ones don 't have and so there 's this market of western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price gamma is just one of these companies i should note also that gamma never actually sold their software to the egyptian government they 'd sent them an invoice for a sale but the egyptians never bought it instead apparently the egyptian government used a free demo version of gamma 's software so this screenshot is from a sales video that gamma produced really they 're just emphasizing in a relatively slick presentation the fact that the police can sort of sit in an air conditioned office and remotely monitor someone without them having any idea that it 's going on you know your webcam light won 't turn on there 's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled is the managing director of gamma international his name is martin muench there are many photos of mr muench that exist this is perhaps my favorite i 'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam you can see there 's a little sticker that 's placed over his camera he knows what kind of surveillance is possible and so clearly he doesn 't want it to be used against has said that he he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles of course he 's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments he has no way of knowing how it can be used they really are selling their software around the world gamma is not the only company in the business as i said industry one of the other big big guys in the industry is an italian company called hacking team now hacking team has what is probably the slickest presentation the video they 've produced is very sexy and so i 'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it 's marketed you want to look through your target 's eyes you have to hack your target many many countries it 's been found in so hacking team has also been actively courting the u s law enforcement market in the last year or so the company has opened a sales office in maryland the company has also hired a spokesperson they 've been attending surveillance industry conferences where law enforcement officials show up they 've spoken at the conferences what i thought was most fascinating was they 've actually paid for the coffee break i can 't tell you for sure that hacking team has sold their technology in the i can tell you that if they haven 't sold it it isn 't because they haven 't been trying hard so as i said before governments that don 't really have the resources to build their own tools will buy off the shelf surveillance software and so for that reason you see that tunisia might use the same software as the government of germany they 're all buying off the shelf stuff my friends at an organization called the electronic frontier foundation they 're a civil society group obtained hundreds of documents from the fbi detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies most of these documents were heavily remote operations unit now when i first looked into this i 'd never heard of this unit before i 've been studying surveillance for more than six years i 'd never heard of it and so i went online and i did some research and ultimately there were lots of former government contractors who had at one point worked for the remote operating unit and were describing in in surprising detail on their cvs what they had done in their former job laughter so i took this information and she was able to contact several other former law enforcement officials who spoke on background and confirmed that yes in fact the fbi has a dedicated team that does nothing but hack into the computers of surveillance targets like gamma and hacking team the fbi also has the capability to remotely activate webcams microphones steal documents get web browsing information the works there 's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking and that 's that terrorists pedophiles drug dealers journalists and human rights activists all use the same kinds of computers there 's no drug dealer phone and there 's and what that means then is that for governments to have the capability to hack into the computers of the real bad guys they also have to have the capability to hack into our devices too so governments around the world have been embracing this technology they 've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique and because thank you very much"
