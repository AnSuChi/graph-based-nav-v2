  "transcript": "and we know these legal distinctions very well because we 've become experts at protecting our but we 're less attuned to the nuances of of the public and we 're doing this through some case studies a large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post industrial space that looks forward and backward at the same time and another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that 's grown out of sync with its time we 've been working on democratizing lincoln center for a public that doesn 't usually have so we 've been eating drinking thinking living public space and it 's taught us really one thing and that is to truly make good public space urbanism landscape media design and so on it really goes beyond distinction now we 're moving onto washington d c and we 're working on another the national mall the mall is a symbol of and what 's fantastic is that this symbol and it 's kind of just defined and they 're inscribed in there forever like the march on washington for jobs and freedom and the great speech that martin luther king gave there the vietnam protests the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of aids the march for women 's reproductive rights right up until almost the present the mall is the greatest civic stage and it may just be a place for civic commiseration there is a huge disconnect and that is that those museums are usually passive they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience as the receiver of information and so you can insects and collections of locomotives and all of that but you 're really not involved you 're being talked to when richard koshalek took over as director of the hirshhorn in two thousand and nine he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place at the seat of power in the art and politics are inherently and implicitly there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness there are over one hundred and eighty embassies in washington d c there are over five hundred think tanks there should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into and somehow through the museum there should be some kind of brain trust so the hirshhorn as we began to think about it and as we but beyond exhibiting contemporary art the hirshhorn will become a public forum a place of discourse for for issues around arts culture it would have the global reach of the world economic forum it would have the interdisciplinarity of the ted conference it would have deployable structure this is it this is the hirshhorn so concrete doughnut designed in the early ' 70s by gordon bunshaft and it 's got an empty core kind of in the times critic had some choice words neo penitentiary modern a maimed monument and a maimed mall for a maimed collection almost four decades later how will this building expand for a new progressive program there is no space there it can 't go in the but how could it take the space of that hole and what language would it take the hirshhorn sits among the mall 's monumental institutions most are neoclassical heavy and opaque made of stone or concrete and the question is if one inhabits that space what is the material and it has to be free but more poetically we like to think of the structure as inhaling the democratic air of the mall into itself the before and the after it was dubbed the bubble by the press the membrane is translucent it 's made of silcon coated glass this is the view from the inside so you might have been wondering it had to be approved by actually two agencies and one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of the mall but one thing i can say is that it 's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration there was also some creative interpretation involved the congressional buildings act of one thousand nine hundred and ten limits the height of buildings to one hundred and thirty feet except for spires towers domes and minarets this pretty much exempts monuments and the bubble is one hundred and fifty three ft that 's so there it is very stately among all the stately buildings in the mall and while this hirshhorn is not landmarked it 's very very historically sensitive and so we couldn 't really touch its surfaces we couldn 't leave any traces behind there but it can 't be more lit than the capitol or some of the monuments so it 's and then and then it 's restrained with the cables and then it 's ballasted with water at the very bottom this is a very strange moment where we were asked by the the bureaucracy at the mall and we said well the first erection would take one week and then it was really easy all the way through so we didn 't really have that many hurdles i have to say with the government and all the authorities but some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones this is the warp and weft but there 's load in every direction and i 'm just going to this is the space in action so flexible interior and form and content are together here the bubble is an the ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity art and politics occupy an ambiguous site blending its air with the democratic air of the mall and the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of two thousand and thirteen thank you"
