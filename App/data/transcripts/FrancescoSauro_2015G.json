  "transcript": "i would like to invite you to come along on a visit to a dark continent it is the continent hidden under the surface of the earth it is largely unexplored poorly understood and it is rich with surprising biological thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers we know also thanks to satellite technology of course we know almost every single square meter of our planet 's we know still very little about what is hidden the potential of cave exploration the geographical dimension is poorly understood and unappreciated because we are creatures living on the surface our perception of the inner side of the planet is in some ways skewed as is that of the depth of the oceans or of the upper atmosphere systematic cave exploration started and an abyss like that means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer caves form in karstic regions so karstic regions are areas of the and we know actually that in the last fifty years have but geologists have estimated that what is still missing to be discovered and mapped is something around ten million kilometers that means that for each meter of a cave that we already know that we have explored there are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages that means that this is really an endless and this estimation is made without considering other types of caves like for example inside glaciers and if we have a look at other planets like for example you will see that this characteristic is not so specific of our home planet and i started with this passion when i was really young in the mountains not far from but soon the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner of the planet searching for new potential entrances of this undiscovered continent and in two thousand and nine i had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains which are in the orinoco and amazon basins enchanted me from the first time i saw them they are surrounded by vertical vertiginous rock walls with silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest and this dramatic landscape inspired among other things also conan doyle 's consider those mountains as islands in time being separated from the surrounding lowlands since tens of millions of years ago they are surrounded by up to only a few of these mountains have been climbed and explored on their top which is a very common mineral on the earth 's crust quartzite so we do not expect at all to find a cave tepuis is extremely long starting about one point six billion years ago with the formation of the rock and then evolving with the uplift of the region so you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis but nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame and so i was focusing in two thousand and ten on one of those and i was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems and finally we identified an area of collapses of the surface so big boulders rock piles so we did several attempts to reach this area by land and with a helicopter but it was really difficult because you you have to imagine that these mountains are covered by clouds most of the year by fog there are strong winds and there are almost four thousand millimeters of rainfall per year so it 's really really difficult to find good conditions and only in two thousand and thirteen we finally landed on the on the spot and we started the exploration of the cave and and it 's the house of the gods you have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there it was impossible for them so when we started the exploration we had to explore with a great respect both because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people but also because it was really a sacred place because and we tried also to share with the community with the indigenous community discoveries and the caves represent really a snapshot of the past the time needed for their formation could be as long as fifty or even years which makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth what you can find there is really when you enter a quartzite cave you have to completely forget what you know about caves because what seems a simple here is not made by calcium carbonate but is made by and one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed but you can find even stranger forms like these mushrooms of silica growing on a boulder and you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave we were the first entering and we were a bit scared because it was all a discovery we didn 't find a dinosaur actually we know that this kind of formation after several we know that these kinds of formations are living organisms they are bacterial colonies using silica to build mineral structures stromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth and here in the tepuis the interesting thing is that these bacteria colonies have evolved in complete isolation from and without being in contact with humans because here you could find for example microbes that could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties and in fact we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science which is so whatever you find in the cave even a small has evolved in the dark in complete isolation so as we explore this dark continent and discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and we will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet and on the relationship what seems only a dark empty environment could be in reality a chest of wonders full of useful information with a team of italian venezuelan and brazilian because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the amazon there are still very unknown mountains like marahuaca which is almost three thousand meters high above sea level or arac which is in the and we suppose that you said we don 't need to go to mars to find alien life and indeed last time we spoke you were in sardinia and you were training european astronauts so what do you roskosmos jaxa astronauts in a cave so they stay in and it 's very similar to a journey to mars or the international space station bg in principle fs yes bg i want to go back to one of the pictures that was in your slide show and it 's just representative of the other photos weren 't those photos amazing yeah audience yeah fs i have to thank the photographers from the team la venta because all of those photos are they 're professionals they 're speleologists and photographers i wonder there is zero light down there and yet they look incredibly well exposed how do you take these pictures how do your colleagues the photographers take these pictures fs yeah they are working the final result is what you want to achieve bg you maybe we can try this at home someday"
