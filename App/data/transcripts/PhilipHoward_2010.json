  "transcript": "i 've always been interested in the relationship of if you build a and what i 'd like to discuss today you might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two if you run a business it 's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel you need a lawyer but it 's not just business that 's affected by this it 's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people a couple of years ago i was hiking it was in a grizzly bear preserve although no one told me that before we went and but she was terrified of lawyers the stories started pouring out she 'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by ten percent when he turned the paper in late the principal didn 't want to stand up to the parent because he didn 't want to get dragged into some after thirty days of sleepless nights she finally capitulated she said life 's too short i just can 't keep keep going with this about the same time she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in laramie which is a couple of hours away and she was going to drive them in you can 't drive them in the car for liability reasons you have to go in a school bus so they provided a bus that held sixty people her husband is also a science teacher but he was told he couldn 't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled so the other get to go on the hike either at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher it 's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible yet when you pull back you see it all the time it 's changed the way we talk i was talking to a pediatrician friend you wouldn 't want to say something off the cuff that might be used against you this is a doctor whose life is caring for people bulging with hidden motives and innuendo where are you from and we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits like the guy in the district of columbia who sued his dry cleaners for million dollars and the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent which is twice as much as in other countries but but the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg what 's happened here again almost without our knowing is so what do we do about it we certainly don 't want to give up the rights when people do something wrong to seek redress in the courts we need regulation to make sure and look at everything is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances that explain why johnny turned his paper in late in cody wyoming and of course the hindsight bias is perfect there 's always a different scenario that you and where accidents will be extinct risk will be no more of course this is utopia you 've got to judge law by its effect on the broader society not individual disputes so let 's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above is it working what does the macro data show us well the healthcare system has been transformed a culture pervaded with defensiveness it 's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives doctors can make more on but reliable estimates range between sixty billion and two hundred billion dollars per year that 's enough to provide care to all the people in america who don 't have the fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up are you sure that 's the you could have a separate section of a law library around each rules it goes on we did a study of all the rules that affect one school tens of thousands of discreet rules sixty steps to suspend a student from school it 's a formula for paralysis what 's the effect of that one again studies have shown it 's directly attributable to the rise of due process agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that forty three percent of the high school teachers in america say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom that means those students are getting half the learning they 're supposed to because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn they 're threatened with a legal claim we also surveyed that seventy eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in america have been threatened by their students with violating their rights with lawsuits but it 's an and how has this system of law worked for government it doesn 't seem to be working neither in sacramento nor in washington the other day at the state of the union speech president obama said and i think we could all agree with this goal from the first railroads to the interstate highway system our nation has always been the first to compete there is no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains actually there is a reason environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn 't like the project people are acting like idiots florida banned running at recess that means all the boys are going to be add i mean it 's my favorite though are all the warning labels caution contents are hot on billions of coffee cups archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won 't know about defensive medicine and stuff labels contents are extremely hot they 'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac that 's the only explanation because my favorite warning was one on a five inch fishing lure i grew up in the south and whiled away the summers fishing five inch fishing lure it 's a big fishing lure with a three pronged hook in the back because it gives us the worst of both worlds it 's random anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury not even an effort at consistency and it 's also too detailed in the areas that are regulated there are so many rules no human could possibly know but the challenge here is not one of just because the hurdle for success is trust people have to trust and so the state can come in it actually changes the way people think it 's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long whispering could that go wrong might that go wrong it drives people from the smart part of the brain deep well of the subconscious where instincts and experience and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic pretty soon the doctor 's saying well i doubt if that headache could be a tumor but who would protect me so maybe i 'll just order the mri then you 've wasted two hundred billion dollars in unnecessary tests if you make people studies show you will make them make worse judgments if you tell the pianist to think about how she 's hitting the notes when she 's playing the piece she can 't play the piece is the enemy of accomplishment got no rules around here we 're trying to accomplish something but it 's like a band aid on this gaping wound of distrust states with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies out and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can 't do or must do isaiah berlin put within which men shall be inviolable we 've forgotten that second part those dikes have burst people wade through law all day long if someone brings a lawsuit nothing that would interest life is too complex for and so here is the fourth proposition we have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals the constitution worked pretty well for two hundred years and how do you make it simple because life is complex and here is the hardest and biggest change we have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law we have to rehumanize the law as you going down and walking down the sidewalk during the day you have to think that if there is a dispute there 's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you 're acting reasonably that person doesn 't exist today it 's actually not very hard ninety eight percent of cases this is a piece of cake maybe you 've got a claim in small claims court takes five minutes that 's it and we wanted to create a legal system the problem is created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values it doesn 't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want they 're still bounded by legal goals and principles the teacher is accountable to the principal but the accountability 's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody not just on the disgruntled person you can 't run a society by the lowest common denominator so what 's needed is a basic shift in philosophy we can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy authority is the enemy of freedom it 's not true authority in fact is essential responsibility is a human institution if teachers don 't have authority to run the classroom to maintain order everybody 's learning suffers if the judge doesn 't then there 's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city otherwise it soon descends into gridlock that 's what 's happened to america so that we can begin to address the challenges of our"
