  "transcript": "and inspiring father he had a passion for flight as you can kind of sense from that small group of us got together to have a a go a run at the whole challenge of flight that inspired and that 's the journey i 'd like to share with you now the starting hypothesis was one of the human mind and body which as you 've seen for the last few days here is an amazing what if you augmented that wonderful machine if you approach flight in that kind of real way where could you get to so my training partner here back in london denton is doing a much better job of that kind of stuff than than me we bought one of these so we got two in a field the real hero here by the way is right in the background there 's a lady tending some vegetables who does a brilliant job of trying to ignore us for a while i think the only thing less happy is the grass that we did that 's around fifty kilos of thrust there there 's only one sensible way to go from there you get four let 's try and spread the load a bit the legs are designed to take the load so don 't we spread it out a bit that bit was good the harness this whole journey was very much about trying things and that included failing by falling over and struck we were starting to make some really quite convincing progress just enough to make you believe that maybe maybe we could get there you can see look tantalizing the model of one on each leg and two on each arm on paper that was enough thrust and then then we did what i 'm about to show you now and i still love watching this one that was the point where this this endeavor went from i 'm really not sure this is going to work to oh my god it does work from there on we then refined it but we carried on falling over a lot falling over like i say is definitely the best way to learn after a while we starting really refining the layout of all of this and you 'll see that 's stability and control there 's no wires there or anything that 's a combination of us refining the technology including with a tupperware box on the back for the electronics and and actually learning the balance and control i 'm now going to save your ears for the next short piece and talk over it after a while the jet engine noise is a bit annoying and i 'd like to think this somewhat validates that starting hypothesis if properly i said i 'm not thinking about where i 'm moving my arms at that stage i 'm looking at the objective of where i want to get to and a bit like riding a bike so where is all this headed over this landing i think i land in this one we 're working on some things that will seek to bring this unusual experience of flight to a wider audience beyond the events and displays we 're doing we 're even starting to look for pilots two and three if there 's any volunteers i 've got this vision it sounds audacious but let 's just stick it out there that one day maybe we can rise up above a beach fly up and down the coastline of it rise up a bit higher with some of the safety kit we 're working on to make this achievable as it comes past you start picking up speed and see if we can intercept from the rear not the front that would be a mistake and then try and land in the back but if i take a big step back from this this is also a very personal journey for me sadly my father took his own life when i was fifteen and left an awful lot of he was a wonderful he would be thank you very much richard browning i 'm probably more nervous about doing the demo after this worst case scenario we don 't get a clean start or we get an unplanned failure while i 'm actually flying around this is why we keep it very low so you can all enjoy day"
