at all do you know which group you 're in if you don 't because the breast has become a very political organ radiologists and medical imaging companies i will do my best this morning to tell you what i but first my disclosures i am not a breast cancer survivor i 'm not a radiologist and i am not seeking your vote what i am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about ten years ago when a patient asked me a question she came to see me after discovering a breast lump her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s she and i were both very pregnant at that time and my heart just ached for her imagining how afraid she must be but she asked me a question how confident was i that i would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one and i reviewed the radiology literature our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin you may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services task force reviewed the world 's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s it took the senate just seventeen days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage radiologists were outraged by the guidelines criticized for protecting their own financial the radiologists are where there is this much legal smoke there is likely to be some fire the factor most responsible for that fire is breast density breast density refers to the relative amount of fat pictured here in yellow versus connective and epithelial tissues pictured in and that proportion is primarily genetically determined two thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue which is why mammography doesn 't work as well in them and although breast so how do you know if your breasts are dense well you need to read the details of your mammography report radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram if the breast is less than twenty five percent dense that 's called followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense and breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense the problem with breast density is that it 's truly the wolf in sheep 's both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram and the x ray often can 't distinguish between the two but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast now it 's bad enough that breast density makes it it 's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer at the time my patient posed this question to me breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature and very few women having mammograms or the physicians ordering them knew about this but what else could i offer her and it 's changed very little there have been surprisingly few innovations until digital mammography was approved in two thousand but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally just like we can with a digital camera the u s has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment and what have we gained from that investment in a study funded by over twenty five million taxpayer dollars digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography and but it was better in one group and that was women under fifty who were but it 's been a very small step forward for womankind what about ultrasound ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies so it 's not widely used but it 's also very expensive if we think about disruptive but it 's the exact opposite in health care the machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive screening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer it 's just way too much equipment one mri scan costs ten times what a digital mammogram costs rather big ideas can be orchestrated if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don 't ordinarily talk about it 's like the essence of ted he quotes one innovator who says the only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick of problems that they don 't realize have solutions and physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don 't realize are problems now take a look at this cartoon that accompanied gladwell 's article and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers i will tell shortly after her visit i was introduced to a nuclear physicist at mayo named michael o 'conner who was a specialist in cardiac imaging something i had nothing to do with where they were talking about a type of gamma detector now but the potential advantage was that gamma rays but this technology could not find tumors when they 're small and finding a small tumor is critical for survival if you can find a tumor when it 's less than a centimeter survival exceeds ninety percent but drops off rapidly as tumor size and this is it so after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging or so here we were and two radiologists and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work and you can see that it looks a lot so how does this work and this is the key difference from mammography and we 've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast but mbi exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors and therefore it 's impervious to breast density and if you 've ever had a mammogram if you 're old enough to have had a mammogram you know what comes we use just light but the mbi image shows that tumor much more clearly as well as a second tumor which profoundly influence that patient 's surgical in this example although the mammogram found one tumor we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors one is small as three millimeters our big break came in two thousand and four and we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi of the tumors that we found mammography found only percent of those tumors mbi found eighty three percent the digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue but the mbi shows an area of intense uptake and in this case a 45 year old medical secretary at mayo who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young which we can also see so now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast we had to solve one very important problem and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this and this image from three weeks ago woman shows a normal digital mammogram but an mbi image showing an uptake and we 're now routinely using one fifth the radiation dose that 's used in any other type of gamma technology mbi generates four images per breast mri generates over a thousand it takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding but i suspect even the but this is why mbi is so potentially disruptive and it 's a fraction of the cost but you can understand why there may be forces in the breast imaging world who prefer the status quo after achieving what we felt were remarkable results our manuscript was rejected by four journals after the fourth rejection we requested reconsideration of the manuscript because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a technology our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal radiology we still need to complete the screening study using and this could take five or more years but i recognize i recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science but it 's not yet widely available there are things that you should know to protect yourself first know your density ninety percent of women don 't and percent of women don 't know that it increases your breast cancer risk the state of connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram i was at a conference of sixty thousand people in breast imaging last week in chicago and i was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is of course we should and if you don 't know please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report second if try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle when breast density is relatively lower third if you notice a persistent change in your breast insist on additional imaging fourth and most important the mammography debate will rage on but i do believe that all women forty and older should have an annual mammogram but this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography 's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation so it takes ten or more years for any we need to individualize screening based on density the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question and the answer has been so slow to come she 's given me her blessing to share this story with you after undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy we can and must do better but in time for you thank you"
