  "transcript": "but before doing that i just briefly want to remind you about what you already know that our genomes our genetic material are stored in almost all cells t c and g and the information is there twice one on each strand which is important if we compare my genome to the genome of you approximately every one thousand two hundred one thousand three hundred letters will differ between us and if you 're then interested in the history of a piece of dna or the whole genome you can reconstruct the and generally we depict our ideas about this history in the form of trees like this farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees and because these mutations happen approximately as a function of time so what has now happened in the last few years is that there are account technologies around that allow you to determine a whole human genome and they are around three billion and we will find that the two genomes in me or one genome of mine we want to use will have about three million differences in the order of that and what you can then also begin to do is to say are these genetic differences distributed across the world and if you look outside africa you actually find less genetic variation this is surprising of course because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in africa than outside africa but if you look in africa there is a component of the genetic variation that has no close relatives outside so a model to explain this is that a part of the african variation and together with the methods to date these genetic differences this has led to the insight that modern humans quite recently between one hundred and two hundred thousand years ago or in quite recent exile another consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally this means that if we determine a dna sequence a genome from one individual we can quite accurately estimate where that person comes from well we can begin to ask those questions also there is for example a project that 's underway to sequence a thousand individuals their genomes from different parts of the world they 've sequenced one hundred and eighty five africans from two populations in africa [ they 've ] sequenced approximately equally [ as ] many people and we can begin to say how much variance do we find how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences and it 's a lot and with absolute difference and i mean a difference where people inside africa at a certain position where all individuals one hundred percent have one letter and the answer to that among those millions of differences is that there is not a single such position ninety five we cannot this may be surprising because we can of course look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from so what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see facial features skin color hair structure there is another hair structure skin color there are also a number of features that vary between continents like that that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest but so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment in a direct confrontation if you like it 's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies but if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don 't directly interact with the environment our kidneys our livers our hearts there is no way to say by just looking so there 's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common and that is that when those humans emerged around one hundred thousand years ago or so they were not alone on the planet there were other forms of humans around most famously perhaps neanderthals these robust forms of humans compared to the left here with modern human skeleton on the right that existed in western asia and europe since several hundreds of thousands of years so an interesting question is what happened when we met what happened to the neanderthals and to begin to answer such questions my research group since over twenty five years now works on methods to extract dna from remains of neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna how you convert it to a form you can sequence you and allowed us last year to present did we mix or not and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe so we then look to do this with pairs of individuals starting with two africans looking at the two african genomes finding places where they differ from each other and in each case ask what is a neanderthal like does it match one african or the other african they should be equal have no reason to be closer to one african than another african statistically speaking there is no difference in how often the neanderthal matches one african or the other but this is different if we now look at the european individual and an african then does a neanderthal match the european rather than the african the same is true if we look at a chinese individual versus an african the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often this may also be surprising because the neanderthals were never in china so the model we 've proposed to explain this presumably they did so first in the middle east where there were neanderthals living if they then mixed with each other there then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa carried with them this neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world so having now a neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the dna we can and the first place we 've done that is in southern siberia in the altai mountains at a place called denisova a cave site in this mountain here where archeologists in two thousand and eight found a tiny little piece of bone this is a copy of it that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky and it was well enough preserved so we could determine the dna from this individual even to a greater extent than for the neanderthals actually and further back eight hundred thousand years ago is there a common origin with present day so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with neanderthals but far back and then have a long independent history we call this group of humans that we then described for the first time from this tiny tiny little piece of bone the denisovans after this place where they were first described we can then ask for denisovans did they mix with ancestors of present day people we surprisingly find no evidence of denisovan dna in any people living but we do find it in papua new guinea and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific we 're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started coming out of africa they meet neanderthals mix with them but they live on a little bit today in some of us in that people outside of africa have two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals and people in does this then mean that there is after all some absolute difference between people outside africa and inside africa in that people outside africa and there were older earlier forms of humans there and since we mixed elsewhere i 'm pretty sure that one day when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms have we learned from studying genomes of present day humans and extinct humans but one thing that i find sort of important to mention is that i think wherever we met them and we mixed with each other ever since"
