  "transcript": "i live in south central fast food so the city planners they get together and they figure they 're going to change the name south central to make it represent something like this is going to fix what 's really going wrong in the city this is south los angeles fast food vacant lots just like twenty six point for instance the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times ten miles away and i was wondering how would you feel if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks so i figured that the problem is the solution so what i did i planted a food forest in front of my house but you have to maintain it so i 'm like cool i can do whatever the hell i 's my responsibility and i gotta maintain it and this is how i decided to vegetables what we do we 're a pay it forward kind of group where it 's composed of gardeners from all walks of life from all over the city and it 's completely volunteer and everything we do is free and the garden it was beautiful and then somebody complained the city came down on basically gave me a citation saying that i had to remove my garden which this citation was turning into a warrant and i 'm like come on really a warrant for planting food on on a piece of land that you could care less about and i was like cool bring it because this time it wasn 't coming up got ahold of it steve lopez did a story on it and and and one of the green grounds members they put up my councilman even called in i mean come on why the united states in vacant lots that the city actually owns they own twenty six square miles of vacant lots that 's twenty central parks that 's enough space to plant seven hundred and million tomato plants why in the hell would they not okay this growing one plant will give you one thousand ten thousand when one dollar 's worth of green beans growing your own food is like printing your own money and i refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people and i 'm manufacturing my own reality see i 'm an artist gardening is my graffiti i grow my art just like a graffiti artist that 's my embellishment for that cloth you 'd be surprised what what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas you just couldn 't imagine how amazing a sunflower is so what i have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood we are the soil be surprised how kids are affected by this gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do plus you get strawberries i remember this time and i came out and they looked so ashamed so i 'm like you know you don 't have to do this like this it made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry i want them to take it but at the same time i want them to take back their health there 's another time when i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown los angeles these are the guys they helped me and they just shared the stories about how we 've had like kids eat kale if they 're not shown how food affects the mind and the body they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them i see young people and but they 're in this thing where they 're caught up i see kids of color and they 're just on this track that 's designed for them so with with gardening i see an opportunity where we can train these kids to have a sustainable life now this is this is one of my plans this is what i want to do i want to plant a whole block of gardens i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes because free is not sustainable the you have to sustain it i 'm talking about is putting people to work and opening farmer 's markets gangstas gangsta gardeners get gangsta with your shovel okay and let that be your weapon of choice don 't call me if you want to sit around in in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit if you want to meet with me come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit"
