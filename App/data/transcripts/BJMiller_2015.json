  "transcript": "we all need a reason to wake up sophomore year of college just back from thanksgiving holiday a few of my friends and i were horsing around and we decided to climb atop a parked somehow that seemed like a i scurried up the ladder on the back and when i stood up blew down and out my feet and that was that takes a licking my father wears it now in solidarity that night began my formal relationship with death my death and it also began my long run as a patient it 's a good word it means one who suffers so the american health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction to match its brilliance to be sure i 'm a physician now a hospice and palliative medicine doc so i 've seen care from both sides and believe me almost everyone who goes into healthcare but we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often why well there 's actually a pretty easy answer to that question and it explains a lot which is to say of course it was badly designed and nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life where things are so distilled and concentrated my purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation that is to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying we have a monumental opportunity in front of us one of the few universal issues so let 's begin at the end for most people the scariest thing about death isn 't being dead it 's dying suffering it 's a key distinction to get underneath this it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is from essential part of life part of the deal and to this we are called to make space it can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves they bring proportionality like a cosmic right sizing after my limbs were gone that loss for example became fact fixed necessarily part of my life and i learned that i could no more reject this fact than reject myself it now another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver human beings yes compassion now on the systems side on the other hand so much of the suffering is unnecessary invented it serves no but the good news is since this brand of suffering is made up well we can change it how we die is indeed something we can affect making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day after all our role as caregivers as people who care is to relieve suffering true to the tenets of palliative care i function as something of a reflective advocate as much as prescribing physician quick aside palliative care a very important field but poorly understood end of life care it is not limited to hospice it now let me introduce you sort of makes this point i 've been seeing frank now for years he 's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long standing hiv we work on his bone pain and his fatigue but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life really about our lives in this way frank grieves in this way he keeps up with his losses as they roll in so that he 's ready to take in the next moment loss is one thing but regret quite another so it wasn 't surprising when he came into clinic one day saying he wanted to raft down the colorado river was this a good idea with all the risks to his safety and his health some would say no many did but he went for it while he still could wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the grand canyon all the glorious side of the world beyond our control frank 's decision while maybe dramatic is exactly the kind so many of us would make if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time after my accident when i went back to college i changed my major to art history studying visual art i figured i 'd learn something about how to see a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn 't change so much of what he was seeing perspective that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with turning anguish into a flower now i work at anyone who wants fellow residents the hearse drivers too now shares a story or a song or silence as we sprinkle the body with flower petals it takes a few minutes it 's a sweet simple parting image contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting much like this floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don 't stop even when the patient 's life has cleaning crew swoops in the body 's whisked away and it all feels as though that person had never really existed well intended of course in the name and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness anesthetic literally the opposite of aesthetic they are no place to live and die that 's not what they were designed for now mind you i am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane beauty can be found anywhere i spent a few months in a burn unit at st barnabas hospital in livingston new jersey where i got really great care at every including good palliative care for my pain and one night it began to snow outside i remember my nurses complaining about driving through it and there was no window in my room but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky next day one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me i cannot tell you the rapture i felt holding that in my hand and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin the miracle of it all the fascination as i watched it melt and turn into water in just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether i lived or died that little snowball packed all the inspiration i needed to both try to live and be ok if i did not in in my work over the years i 've known many people who were ready not because they had found some final peace or transcendence but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become there are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness and into ever we need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population now is the time to create something new something education and training bricks and mortar we have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with we know for example from research what 's most important to people who are closer to death comfort and a sense of wonderment and spirituality we 've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail little things aren 't so little take janette she finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to als well guess what she wants to start smoking again and french cigarettes if you please priorities change or kate she just wants know her dog austin is lying at the foot of her bed his instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins she 's done that we are rewarded for just by way of the body probably the most poignant room in the zen hospice guest house is our kitchen which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little if anything at all but we realize we are providing sustenance on seriously with all the heavy duty stuff happening under our roof one of the most tried and true interventions we know of is to bake cookies as long as we have our senses even just one connected imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia sensorial delights that say the things we don 't have words for impulses that make us stay present no need for a past or a future so then tending to dignity by way of the senses by way of the body the aesthetic realm is design cue number two now namely we need to lift our sights to set our sights on rather than just less horrible beneficence human centered model of care generative even playful act play may sound like a funny word here the need for food has birthed cuisine the fashion and for being subjected to the clock we invented since dying is a necessary part of life what might we create with this fact rather i am asking that we make space physical psychic room to allow life to play itself all the way out aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end i know some of you are working on this we can design towards it parts of me died early on and that 's something we can all say one way or another and i tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left all the while melting away if we love but because of it let death be what takes us not lack of imagination"
