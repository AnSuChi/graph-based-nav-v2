  "transcript": "and i personally am obsessed with morality it was all due to this woman sister mary marastela also known as my mom i saw that people who were religious and non religious were equally obsessed with morality i thought after ten years of experiments i found it would you like to see it i brought this little syringe contains the moral molecule it it was known to i did what most of us do i tried it on some colleagues one of them told me paul that is the world 's stupidist idea but i countered well men 's brains make this too there must be a reason why it was a stupid idea but it was testably stupid in other words i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral turns out it wasn 't so easy first of all oxytocin is a shy baseline levels are near zero without some stimulus to cause its release and when it 's produced it has a so this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin have to grab it fast and keep it cold i think i can do that so i could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery so i started smaller i studied one single virtue why so in these countries more economic transactions occur so poor countries i don 't want to just ask people are you trustworthy let me show you how we do that we recruit some people for an experiment they all get $ ten if they agree to show up we give them lots of instruction and we never ever deceive them then we match them in pairs by computer and in that pair one person gets a message saying do you want to give up some of your $ ten you earned for being here you only do it one time and they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money do you want to keep it all or do you want to send some amount back so think about this experiment for minute you 're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood so in fact experimental economists had run this test around the world and for much higher stakes and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust why not keep it all well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received but wait what 's wrong with this experiment so we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin have any effect but the second is i used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain and i found i could do it we put two hundred men on oxytocin or placebo had that same trust test with money and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger but is it the moral molecule we ran we showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by eighty percent we showed it increases donations to charity by fifty percent we dancing my mom was happy about that last one but why do they do this what does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin year old son and his son has terminal brain cancer the change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy so it 's empathy that makes us connect to other people it 's empathy that makes us help other people it 's empathy that makes us moral now this idea is not new the theory of moral sentiments in this book smith argued that we are moral creatures not because of a top down reason but for a bottom up reason so i tend to avoid that if i do something that makes you happy i get to share because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off in particular it tells us why we see immorality you sit in a gas station all day you see lots of morality and immorality let me tell you opens in the men 's room i just found this what do you think we should do with it i don 't know we have to find the owner for this i said yea so we 're trying to decide what to do with this and the phone rings and a man says very excitedly i was in your gas station a while ago and i bought this jewelry for my wife and i can 't find it relax get yourself a fat reward life 's good he said i and i need this job i 've got to go i have no idea i was conned so and i was the pigeon so the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him it 's that he shows he trusts the victim now we know what the victim 's brain releases oxytocin and you 're opening up your wallet or purse giving away the money so there 's a technical word for these people in my lab we call them bastards these are not people you want to have a beer with they have many of the attributes of psychopaths now there are other ways the system can be inhibited one is through and about half those don 't release oxytocin on stimulus you need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly also high stress so we all know this when we 're really stressed out we 're not acting our best there 's another way oxytocin is inhibited which is interesting high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish we have oxytocin that connects us to others makes us feel what they feel and we have testosterone and men have ten times the testosterone as women so men do this more than women we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally i didn 't know a single person and i took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows and but they do so in a very particular way who is the center of the wedding solar system the bride her mother that 's right her mother was number two so i think it tells us that we 've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple connect us emotionally why because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species i and i had a huge spike of oxytocin there are so many ways we can connect to people i mean astounding no one has this i don 't know what this guy was doing but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend they checked he was interacting on his girlfriend 's facebook page there you go that 's connection so there 's tons of ways that we can connect to other people and it seems to be universal two weeks ago just got back from papua new guinea where i went up to the highlands very isolated tribes of of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia there are eight hundred different languages in the highlands and they indeed also release oxytocin so oxytocin connects us to other people oxytocin makes us feel i know how to do it and my favorite way to do it is in fact the easiest let me show it to you we have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier and because they have better relationships of all types eight hugs a day you 'll be happier and the world will be a better place of course if you don 't like to touch people i can always shove this up your nose"
