  "transcript": "you 're looking at a woman obviously that 's changed it was several months ago that i gave my very first major public talk at the forbes thirty under thirty summit five hundred brilliant people all under the age of thirty and the youngest just four i joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs night of my speech a surprising thing happened at the age of forty one i was hit on by a and i declined you know what his unsuccessful pickup line was he could make me feel twenty two again i 'm probably the only person over forty who does not want to be and at the age of twenty four i learned the devastating consequences can i see a show of hands of anyone here who didn 't make a mistake or do something they regretted at so like me at twenty two a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person unlike me though your boss probably wasn 't the president of the united states of america life is full of surprises and i regret that mistake deeply in i was then swept up into the eye of a political legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before reading a newspaper or magazine listening to the radio but that wasn 't my fate instead this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution that meant we anywhere it was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major a click that reverberated around the world what that meant for me personally was that overnight i went from being a completely private figure i was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously this rush to judgment enabled by technology led to mobs of virtual granted it was before social media but people could still email cruel jokes news sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers ads online and to keep people tuned to the tv now i admit i made mistakes especially wearing that beret but that i i was branded bimbo and of course that woman i was seen by many but actually known by few and i get it it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional had a soul and was once unbroken there was no name for it now we call it cyberbullying and online harassment and how i hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others lost my life let me paint a picture for you it is september of one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight i 'm sitting in a windowless office room inside the office of the independent counsel underneath i 'm listening i 'm here because i 've been legally required to personally authenticate all twenty hours of taped conversation the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the sword i listen listen as i prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day listen as i confess my love for the president and of course my heartbreak to my sometimes catty sometimes churlish sometimes silly self a self i don 't even recognize the starr report is released to congress and all of those tapes and transcripts those stolen words form a part of it the public humiliation was excruciating life was almost unbearable this was not something that happened with regularity back then in conversations or and then making them public and now social media has been born and now it 's for both and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from rutgers when the online world learned of this incident the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited a tyler jumped from the george washington bridge to his death and she was gutted with pain and then eventually i realized she was reliving one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night literally too many parents haven 't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones too many have learned of their child 's suffering and humiliation after it was too late it served to and i then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the internet would take us but the darkness cyberbullying and slut shaming that especially young people who are not developmentally equipped to handle this are so abused and humiliated that they can 't imagine living to the next day and some tragically don 't and there 's nothing virtual about that released a staggering statistic late last year from two thousand and twelve to two thousand and thirteen there was an eighty seven percent increase in calls and emails related to cyberbullying a meta analysis done out of the netherlands showed that for the leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying although it shouldn 't have was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion than either happiness or even anger cruelty to others is nothing new technologically enhanced shaming and permanently accessible village school or community but now it 's the online community too millions of people often and there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stockade there is a very personal price to public humiliation and the growth of the internet has jacked up that price for nearly two decades now we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil both on and offline gossip websites paparazzi reality programming politics news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame 's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online invasion of privacy and cyberbullying this shift has created what professor nicolaus mills calls a culture of humiliation consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the lifespan of a few seconds you can imagine the range of content that that gets and one hundred thousand and videos were leaked online to now have a lifespan of forever jennifer lawrence and several other actors had their icloud accounts hacked and private intimate nude photos were plastered across the internet without their permission one gossip website and what about the sony pictures the documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value but in this culture of humiliation there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming the price does not measure the cost to the victim which tyler and too many others notably women minorities but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them packaged and sold at a profit a marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity and shame is an industry how is the money made the more advertising dollars we the more we click on this kind of gossip the more numb we get to the human lives behind the more we click all the while someone is making money off of the back of someone else 's suffering the more accepted it is the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying why because they all have humiliation at their cores this behavior is a symptom of the culture we 've created just think about it changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs today and in the past as we 've changed beliefs about same sex marriage more people have been offered equal freedoms when we began valuing sustainability more people began to recycle so as far as our culture of humiliation goes what we need is a cultural revolution and it 's time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture the shift begins with something simple but it 's not easy we need to return to a long held value of compassion and i quote shame can 't survive empathy shame cannot survive empathy i 've seen some very dark days in my life was the compassion and empathy professionals and sometimes even strangers that saved me even empathy from one person can make a difference says that even in small numbers when there 's consistency over time change can happen in the online world we can foster minority influence by becoming we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation we can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these kinds of issues like the tyler clementi foundation in the u s there 's project rockit we talk a lot about we all want to be heard but let 's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention but online showing empathy to others benefits us all we need to communicate online with consume news with compassion and click with compassion just imagine walking a mile in someone else 's headline i 'd like to end on a personal note why was i sticking my above the parapet the top note answer was and is because it 's time time to stop tip toeing around my past time to stop living a life of opprobrium and time to take back my narrative it 's also not just anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing it may not be painless quick or easy but you can insist on a different ending to your story have compassion for yourself we all deserve compassion and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world thank you for listening"
