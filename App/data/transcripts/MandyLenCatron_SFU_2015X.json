  "transcript": "today i want to talk about how we talk about love and specifically i want to talk about what 's wrong with how we talk about love and in the english language this metaphor metaphor falling is really the main way that we talk about that experience i don 't know about you but when i conceptualize this metaphor what i picture is straight out of a cartoon he 's walking down the sidewalk without realizing it he crosses over an open manhole and he just and i picture it this way because falling is not jumping it 's something that happens to us without our consent and this this is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship i am a writer and i 'm also an english teacher which means i think about words for a living you could say that i get paid to argue that the language we use matters and i would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use to talk about love maybe even most of them are a problem we 're struck we burn with passion and it makes us sick and then they break so our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness they do and they position us as the victims of unforeseen and totally unavoidable which is the past participle of the word smite and if you look this word up in the dictionary you will see that it can be defined as both grievous affliction and to be very much in love i tend to associate the word smite with a very particular context which is the old which is the word that the bible uses for the vengeance of an angry god laughter here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts right so how did this happen how have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering and why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims these are difficult questions but i have some theories which is the idea of love as madness i found these madness metaphors everywhere the history of western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness william shakespeare love is merely a madness from as you like it friedrich nietzsche there is always some madness in love got me looking got me looking so crazy in love from the great philosopher beyonc knowles and it was long distance for the first couple of years so for me that meant i can remember one moment in particular i was and i was watching the person i love and it was late it was nearly midnight he threw his things in the bag and stormed out while i can no longer remember what that argument was about i very clearly remember how i felt watching him leave and i knew the name of the town that i was in and the name of the city i had no guidebook someone more adventurous than me i just but despite my panic some small voice in my head thought wow that was dramatic i must really be doing this love thing right and it sounds so strange to me now but at longed to have dramatic experiences and in that moment i was irrational and furious and devastated i thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings i had for the guy who had just left me i think on some level i wanted to feel a little bit crazy this really should not be surprising considering that according to wikipedia there are eight films two albums and one novel with the title crazy love i thought that was so terrible this must be a real romance i expected my first love to feel like madness and of course it met that expectation very well but loving someone like that as if my entire well being depended on him loving me back was not very good for me i suspect this experience of love is not that unusual most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love in fact there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal romantic love and mental illness this is true levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with and low levels of serotonin are also associated with seasonal affective disorder and depression so there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors and there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin but the good news is it doesn 't always last that long usually from a few months to a couple of years desperate to hear from the guy i loved i decided that if my friends could not understand but i think i felt like it was my job to be miserable because if i could be miserable then i would prove and if i could prove it then we would have to end up together eventually this is the real madness because there is no cosmic rule rule that says that great suffering equals great reward but we talk about love as if this is true our experiences of love are both biological and cultural and it tells us that love is painful when after a fight or a breakup that neurochemical which i find reassuring our culture uses language to shape and reinforce these ideas about love in this case we 're talking about metaphors about pain and addiction and madness kind of an interesting feedback loop and we express this in our words and stories but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful what 's interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy it seems like we want it both ways we want and we want it to last an entire lifetime that sounds terrible laughter to reconcile this we need to either change our culture or change our expectations so imagine if we were all less passive in love if we were more assertive more open minded more generous and instead of i know that this is asking a lot but i 'm not actually the first person to suggest this and that they can even act love as a collaborative i really like this way of thinking about love linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments these ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long term romantic commitment but they also work well for other kinds of relationships short term casual polyamorous non monogamous asexual because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone so if love is a collaborative work of art love is an aesthetic experience love is unpredictable love is creative love requires communication and discipline it is frustrating and emotionally demanding and love involves both joy and pain it never occurred to me that i was allowed to demand more from love that i didn 't have to just accept whatever love offered she does not feel disappointed or angsty is she romeo is not dead he 's just been banished from the city juliet 's suffering made sense to me rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent is empowering and when i feel really frustrated i have to remind myself my job in this relationship is to talk to my partner about what i want to make together but it 's just so much better than the alternative which is that thing that feels like madness this version of love is not about winning or losing someone 's affection instead it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult radical act this is because you get to stop thinking about yourself we 're not very good collaborators maybe this isn 't for us but thank you"
