  "transcript": "joined the united states air force and was assigned to mountain home air force base and was a part of the air police squadron upon first arriving there the first goal that i had the people down there love us because they know if they have an airman who is coming in to rent one of their apartments they 'll always get their money and that was a really important thing he said so here is a list of people that you can call and then they will then allow you to select the apartment that you want so i got the list we have four or five apartments 's not talk about that just come on down select the apartment that you want we 'll sign the contract and you 'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away so i was excited i jumped in my car i went downtown and she looked at me but my husband rented those apartments and didn 't tell me about them she said why don 't you leave your number i did not get a call from her nor did i get any responses from the other people that they gave me on the list where i could get apartments so as a result of that and feeling rejected i went back to the base and i talked to the squadron commander his name was we can 't make people rent to folks that they don 't want to rent to and besides we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really don 't want to damage that he said so maybe this is what you should do why don 't you let your family stay home because you do know that you so once a year you can go home to your family spend thirty days and then come on back and talking to the clerk he said jim i think i have a solution for you there 's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer if you noticed in mountain home there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place you can buy his trailer and you 'd probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town and that would provide the solution for you and that would take care before i say yes to that i need to check with management but it just so happened that he had promised that slot to someone else so what i did list of going to trailer parks i went to one after another after another and i got the same kind of rejection there that i received when i was looking for the apartment and the kind of comments that they made to me in addition to saying that they didn 't have any slots open one the reason why we can 't rent to you we already have a negro family in the trailer park he said and it 's not me because i like you people it didn 't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot from other trailer but the conclusion i reached at that moment was that i didn 't have idaho and of course eventually things settled down we won 't even talk about that was another great location brand new automobile my mother called and said she 'll fly out she 'll be with us as we drive she 'll help us manage the children so she came out her and alice put a lot of food together for the trip that morning we left at about five a m we got a little bit tired and we said why don 't we get a motel so that we can rest and then have an early start in the morning so we were looking at a number of the motels as we drove down the road and we saw one it was a great big bright flashing light that said so we stopped in they were in the parking lot i went inside when i walked inside the lady was just finishing up one contract with some folks how can i help you i said i would like to get a motel for the evening for my family i just rented the last one we will not have no one said anything and i told my mother and i told my wife and and also melanie and i said looks like we 're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight and we did drive down the road but just before we took off and pulled out of the parking lot guess what happened vacancies we were able to find a nice place but it was secure and it was clean and so we had a great sleep that night where we were rejected from hotels but we made it to pennsylvania we which is another story right here it is years later i now have nine grandchildren five of the grandchildren are boys i have master 's ph d undergrad they 're almost there but not quite i have one who has been in college now for eight years so we 're just trying to get him to stay because you never know just because you 're funny at home does not make you a comedian right no crime so with that being the backdrop i was sitting in my tv room watching tv and they were talking about ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on and all of a sudden one of the news commentators got on the air and she said in the last three months for some reason at that moment it just all hit me i said what is it it is so insane what is the hatred that 's causing people to do these kinds of things just then one of my talking while black it 's just dangerous we place both hands on the steering wheel at the twelve o 'clock position if asked to get identification when laid on the ground to be we don 't challenge because we know you 've told us ' don 't you challenge the police after it 's over when they hear about these kinds of things happening to us they say ' why you need to ask them for their identification ' and here 's what the boys have been taught to tell them we know that you can do that but please do not do that while we 're in the car because the consequences for you you are significantly different than the consequences for us and so as a grandparent what do i tell my grandsons how do i keep them alive as a result of this people have come to and i also know the consequences of being enraged so therefore the only thing that i can do is take my collective intellect anything that looks i want to appeal i want to appeal to their humanity to their dignity to their civic pride and ownership to be able to not react but instead to elevate your level of societal knowledge your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness to then collectively come together all of us come together to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity any kind of insanity that makes it okay to kill unarmed people their diversity makeup"
