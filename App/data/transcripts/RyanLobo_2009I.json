  "transcript": "and i 've been involved in the documentary filmmaking business all over the world for the last ten years during the process of making these films i found myself taking photographs often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen i found this photography of i would sometimes feel that i had photographs that told a better story than documentary i traveled to iraq afghanistan and liberia and over there i experienced other people 's suffering up close and personal immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories and at times i experienced great fear for my own life as always i would return to bangalore and often to animated discussions at friend 's homes where we would discuss various issues and i decided that i had compromised just like my friends in those discussions where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for rather than taking responsibility for i won 't go into but let 's just say it involved alcohol cigarettes other substances and a woman laughter i basically decided that it was i not the camera or the network or anything that lay outside myself that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning paradoxically when i let go of these objectives and worked from a place of compassion and purpose looking for excellence rather than the results of it everything arrived on its own including my own and it is for me a language which expressed the intangible and gives voice to people and stories without i invite you into three recent stories of mine which are about this way of looking if you will which i believe exemplify the tenets of what i like to call in two thousand and seven where a group of my friends and i did an independent self funded film still in progress on a very legendary and brutal war lord named general butt naked his real name is joshua and he 's pictured here in a cell where he once used to torture and murder people including children joshua claims to have personally killed more than ten thousand people during liberia 's civil war he got his name from fighting stark naked and he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on earth today this woman witnessed the general murdering her brother joshua commanded today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin and they are destitute like these young men in the image how do you live with yourself if you know you 've committed today visiting villages where he had once killed and raped he seeked forgiveness and he claims to endeavor to improve the lives of his child soldiers but what i saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which i never thought possible in the midst of incredible poverty and loss people who had nothing absolved a man who had everything from them until he disobeyed orders and the general shot off both his legs in this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him and joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him in a context of great suffering that he i was intensely moved during all this but the question is and speaks about them from soapboxes across monrovia to an audience that often includes his victims a very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of separation of church and state the second story i 'm going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace keeping skills thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale liberia is now home to an united nations contingent of indian peacekeepers these women many from small towns in india help keep the peace far away from home and family and that they were definitely capable of diffusing it until he noticed the women who handled him with smiles and ak 47s at the ready of course and it has not sustained any casualties even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in liberia and yes and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children and when i asked one of the women about the shock and awe response she said don 't worry same thing back home we know how to deal with these fellows and ignored them in a country ravaged by violence against women indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women to join the police force i came back to india and nobody was interested in buying the story and one editor told me that she wasn 't interested in doing what she called manual labor stories in two thousand and seven and two thousand and nine i did stories on the delhi fire service the dfs which during the summer is probably the world 's most active like as we neared angry crowds attacked our trucks and stoned them by hundreds of people all over the place these men were running the gauntlet through hostile crowds and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses from the firemen to put out the where does such rage come from and how are we responsible for this which are chronically they lack even the most basic amenities and this is something that is common to all our big cities thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals were blazing away and exploding all around us and with no protective clothing in india we often love to complain about our government bodies but over led the firefight with their men something wonderful in a country where manual labor is often looked down upon over the years my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested and i 've had very serious doubt about its efficacy and my own faith in humanity and when it airs i get calls from all the guys i i was with some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired to do better because they were so pleased to get thank yous rather than brick bats the power of storytelling"
