  "transcript": "there are a lot of web two point zero consultants who make a lot of money in fact they make their living on this stuff i 'm going to try to save you all the time and money and go through it in the next three minutes so bear with me started a website in two thousand and five with a few friends 's what you 'd call a social news website basically the democratic front page of the best stuff on the web you find some interesting content say a ted talk submit it to reddit and a community of your but this isn 't about reddit it 's about discovering new things in the last four years we 've seen all kinds of memes all kinds of trends get born right on our front page it 's actually about humpback whales well technically it 's about greenpeace an environmental organization that wanted to stop the japanese government 's whaling campaign the whales were getting killed they wanted to put an end to it one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of the whales but to personify the movement they wanted to name it so in true web fashion they put together a poll where they had a bunch of very erudite very thoughtful cultured names i for immortal i think this means divine power of the ocean in a polynesian language and then there was this mister splashy pants and this this was a special name mister pants or splashy to his friends was very popular on the internet in fact someone on reddit thought what a great thing we should all vote this up and redditors responded and it wasn 't long before other sites like fark and boing boing and the rest of the internet started saying we love splashy pants so it went from about five percent which was when this meme started greenpeace actually wasn 't that crazy about it because they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win they said no just kidding we 'll give it another week of voting well that got us a little angry so we changed it to fightin ' splashy and the reddit community really the rest of the internet really got behind this facebook groups were created facebook applications were created the idea was vote your conscience vote for mister splashy pants people were putting up signs in the real world of the landslide the next highest name pulled in three there was a clear lesson the internet loves mister splashy pants which is obvious it 's a great name everyone wants to hear their news anchor say mister splashy pants laughter i think that 's what helped drive this what was cool were the repercussions greenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it mister splashy pants shirts and pins an e card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy but even more important was that they accomplished their mission the japanese government called off their whaling expedition mission accomplished greenpeace was thrilled the whales were happy that 's a quote really greenpeace came back to the site and thanked reddit for its participation but this wasn 't really altruism just interest in doing something cool this is how the internet works this is that great big secret that is as long as you can keep net neutrality in place another important thing is it costs nothing to get content online there are so many publishing tools available it only takes a few minutes iteration is so cheap you might as well if you do be genuine be honest up front one of the great lessons greenpeace learned is that it 's ok to lose control you could ultimately achieve your goal that 's the final message i want to share you can do well online but no longer is the message coming from just the top down if you want to succeed you 've got to be ok to lose control"
