  "transcript": "to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry and the way i 'm going to do that is present to you five animations of five of my and let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act but when i was united states poet laureate and i love saying that it 's a great way to start sentences when i was him back then i was approached by j walter thompson the ad company and they were hired sort of by the sundance channel and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them and i was initially resistant because i always think poetry can stand alone by itself attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results in all cases already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed and surely if you 're reading a poem that mentions a cow and also i 'm like a total cartoon junkie since i think more influential than emily dickinson or coleridge or wordsworth and this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places and i 'm pretty much all for poetry in public places poetry on buses poetry on subways on billboards when i was poet laureate there i go again i can 't help it it 's true i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years so you could tune into poetry as you were flying off the shelves and more into public life start a meeting with a poem that would be an idea you might take with you when you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever it happens to you so suddenly that you don 't have time to deploy your anti poetry deflector shields that were installed in let us start with the first one it 's the secrets of the creative process narration budapest my pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sleeve intent as any forager that has nothing on its mind nose pressed against the writing a few more dutiful lines while i gaze out the window and imagine budapest or some other city where i have never been bc so that makes it seem a little easier writing is not actually as easy as that for me but i i like to pretend that it comes with ease one of my students came up after class an introductory class and she said you know poetry is harder than writing which i found both erroneous and profound he 's another poet he says that hide all evidence you ever tried the next poem is also rather short poetry just says a few things in different ways and i think you could boil this poem down to saying some days you eat the bear other days the bear eats you and it uses the bend their legs at the knees if they come with that feature and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs the woman in but other days i am the one who is lifted up by the ribs but how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next if you were going to spend it striding around like a vivid god your shoulders in the clouds or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper staring straight ahead with your little plastic face bc there 's a horror movie in there the next poem is called forgetfulness and it 's really just a kind of poetic essay on the subject of mental slippage and the poem begins with a certain forgetting the things that you have read the heartbreaking conclusion which suddenly becomes one you have never read never even heard of it is as if one by one the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones long ago you kissed the names of the nine muses good bye and you watched the quadratic equation pack its bag and even now as you memorize the order of the planets something else is slipping away a state flower perhaps the address of an it is not poised on the tip of your tongue not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen it has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an l well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim and how to ride a bicycle no wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war no wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know next poem is called the country and it 's based on when i was in college i met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine he lived and still does in rural vermont i lived in new and we would visit each other and when i would go up to the country he would teach me things like deer hunting which meant getting lost with a gun basically and trout fishing and stuff like that and then he 'd come down to new york city and i 'd teach him what i knew which was largely smoking and drinking and in that way we traded lore with each other 's coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that i had a very hard time at first processing it 's called the country narration the country because the mice might get into them and start a fire but your face was absolutely straight when you twisted the lid down on the round tin where the matches you said are always stowed who could whisk away the thought of the one unlikely mouse padding along a cold water pipe behind the floral wallpaper gripping a single wooden match between the needles of his teeth the sudden flare shining moment suddenly thrust ahead of his time lit up in the blazing insulation the tiny looks of wonderment on the faces of his fellow mice one time inhabitants of what once was your house in the country and the last poem is called the dead i wrote this after a friend 's funeral but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying as all eulogists tend to do which is they are looking down through the glass bottom boats of heaven as they row themselves slowly through eternity they watch the tops of our heads moving drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon which makes them lift their oars and fall silent and wait like parents for us to close our eyes other poems will be animated it took a long time i mean it 's rather uncommon to have this marriage a long time to put those two together but then again it took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together laughter i mean we had the wheel for some you would be all done in only one more year of course you couldn 't have done that all alone so never mind you 're fine just being yourself you 're loved for just being you joan of arc was leading the french army to victory and blaise pascal had cleaned up his room no wait i mean he had invented the calculator after you come out of your room and begin to blossom or at least pick up all your socks for some reason i keep remembering that lady but then she was beheaded so never mind her as a role model a few centuries later four operas and two complete but of course that was in austria at the height of romantic lyricism not here in the suburbs of cleveland frankly who cares if annie oakley was a crack shot at fifteen or if maria callas debuted as tosca at seventeen we think you 're special just being you playing with your food and staring into space but that doesn 't mean he never helped out around the house"
