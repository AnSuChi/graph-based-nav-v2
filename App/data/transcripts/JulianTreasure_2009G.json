  "transcript": "let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental much of it is unpleasant we stand on street corners shouting over noise this habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious there are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time and i 'd like to raise them in your consciousness today the first is physiological sorry about that i just gave you a shot of cortisol your fight flight hormone sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time but also your breathing heart rate which i just also did it 's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it this is surf it has the frequency of roughly twelve cycles per minute most people find that very soothing and interestingly twelve cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human so there is a deep resonance with being at rest we also associate it with being stress free and on holiday the second way in which sound music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state this is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if i leave it on natural sound can do that too birdsong for example is a sound which most people find reassuring it 's when they stop you need to be worried the third way in which sound affects you is cognitively you can 't understand two people talking at once or in this case one person talking twice you have to choose which me you 're going to listen to we have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input which is why noise like this offices as in quiet rooms i have a tip for you if you work in spaces like that carry headphones with you with a soothing sound like birdsong put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be the fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally with all that other stuff going on it would be 't get away from noise like that it 's extremely damaging for their health and that 's not the only thing that bad sound damages most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental even hostile and it has a dramatic effect on sales for you retailers you may want to look away before i show this slide [ inappropriate retail soundscapes sales down twenty eight they 're losing up to thirty percent of their business with people leaving shops faster or just turning around at the door we 've all done it left the area because the sound in there is so dreadful i want to spend just a moment talking about the model we 've developed which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound and we 're in the business of designing soundscapes music is the most powerful sound there is often inappropriately deployed it 's powerful for two most of you associate that with something now those are one second samples of music music is very powerful and unfortunately it 's veneering commercial spaces often inappropriately i hope that 's going to change over the next few years about brands for a moment since some of you run brands every brand is out there making sound right now i 'm glad to say that is starting to happen now intel ad you all recognize that one this is the most played tune in the world today one point eight billion times a day that tune is played and it cost nokia absolutely leave you with four golden rules for those of you who run businesses for commercial sound first make it congruent pointing in the same direction as your visual communication that increases impact by over one thousand one hundred percent thirdly make it valuable give people something with the sound don 't just bombard them with stuff finally test and test it again sound is complex there are many countervailing influences it can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens it 's good for your health and for your productivity if we all do that we move to a state that i like to think will be sound living in the world thank you for lending me your ears today"
