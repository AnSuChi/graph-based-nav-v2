  "transcript": "i decided when i was asked to do this that what i really wanted to talk about was my friend richard feynman i was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence and i 'm going to tell i 'm sure there are people here who could tell you about the richard feynman they knew and it would probably be a different richard feynman richard feynman was a very complex man you saw him act i also had the good fortune to be in those lectures up in the he was a teacher par excellence he was full of macho a kind of macho and what i mean by that is a lot of room in my case i can 't speak for anybody else well not as big as his but fairly big i always felt good with dick feynman and the two of us could solve any problem whatever but we did have a lot of fun he loved to win but when he didn 't win when he lost he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won i remember once he told me a story about a joke the students played on him they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in pasadena it may still exist i don 't know you could get a marilyn monroe sandwich you could get a humphrey bogart sandwich and arranged that they all order feynman sandwiches one after another they came in and ordered feynman sandwiches feynman loved this story he told me this story and he was really happy and i said to him dick i wonder what would be the difference between a feynman sandwich and a susskind sandwich and without skipping a beat at all he said be about the same the only difference is a susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham i happened to have been very quick that day and i said yeah but a lot less baloney but absolutely no a couple of times up in san francisco at some very rich guy 's house up in san francisco for dinner and the last time the rich guy invited us he also invited a couple of philosophers these guys were philosophers of mind and they were full of all kinds of jargon i 'm trying to remember the words and what did we talk what do you talk about when you talk about minds there 's one obvious thing to talk about can a machine become a mind can you build a machine that thinks like a human being that is conscious but the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been a scientific question after all and this was a very very dangerous thing to do around dick feynman but and the amazing thing is these guys were and it was something special i realized there was something just extraordinary about feynman even when he did what he did dick he was my friend i did call him dick i also like the intellectual macho games and dick became convinced at some point that he and i had some kind of similarity of and he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that that there was this funny connection the reason he called me leonardo is because we were in europe and he was practicing his french and he said leonardo were you closer to your mother or your father when you were a kid he was a master mechanic and he taught me how to use tools he taught me he called it the shortcut distance and feynman 's eyes just and he said that he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father in fact he had been convinced at one time that to be a good i apologize for the sexist conversation here but this is the way it really happened said he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary a necessary part of being dick he of course wanted to check this he wanted to go out and do an experiment well he went out and did an experiment he asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists was it your mom or your pop that influenced you there went that theory down the trash can of history but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience i don 't know feynman 's style no style is not the right word style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing it 's something much deeper than that but i can 't think of another word for it feynman 's scientific style was always to look for the simplest if it wasn 't possible you had to use something fancier no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could but he also deeply believed he truly believed that if you couldn 't explain something simply you didn 't understand it people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked it was due to a russian mathematical physicist it was a complicated theory i 'll tell you what it was soon enough it was a terribly complicated theory full of very difficult integrals and formulas and mathematics and so forth and it sort of worked but it didn 't work very well the only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very very far apart unfortunately the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other feynman decided as a sort of amateur helium physicist that he would try to figure it out he would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like he would try to visualize guided by a small number of simple principles the other fact is that in the ground state the lowest energy state of a quantum system the wave function is always very has the minimum number of wiggles so he sat down and i imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil and he tried to write down and did write down the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between that i suspect a student who didn 't even have calculus could understand what he wrote down i 've always wondered they had their technique and they in my own university i wasn 't there at the time and the way to analyze it was of course feynman diagrams that 's what feynman diagrams were constructed for to understand particles you simply take the proton and you hit it really sharply with an electron this was the thing the feynman diagrams were for the only problem was that feynman diagrams are complicated they 're difficult if you could do all of them you would have a very precise theory but you couldn 't they were just too complicated people were trying to do them you could do a one loop diagram don 't worry about one loop one loop two loops maybe you could do a three loop diagram but beyond that you couldn 't do anything feynman said forget all of that just think of the proton as an assemblage they don 't move and because they don 't move during the course of the experiment you just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons this was the key to analyzing these experiments extremely effective somebody said the word revolution is a bad but it certainly evolved and of particles beyond that well i had some more that i was going to tell you about my connection with feynman what he was like but i see i have exactly half a minute i think he would have said i think the answer is we should honor feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can thank you"
