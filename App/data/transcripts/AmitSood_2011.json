  "transcript": "and i pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art and it took eighteen months a lot of fun negotiations and stories i can tell you with seventeen very interesting museums from nine countries but i 'm going to focus on the demo there are and i grew up in india i and so when i started traveling and going to these so we formed a team a great team of people and we started doing this i 'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we 've had since launch the hermitage the rijks the van gogh i two ways of going in very simple click you want to navigate around the museum the plan up and in one click jump keep going have fun thanks i haven 't come to the best part so now i 'm in front of one of my favorite paintings the harvesters by pieter bruegel at the met you click on it now this is one of the images so this is all of the meta data information for those of you who are truly interested in art you can click this but i 'm going to click this off right now and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology so this image for example has close to i think around ten billion pixels i get a lot of people asking me you can zoom around very simply you see some fun stuff happening here his expression is priceless and i found something going on over here and i was like hold on that sounds interesting and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something which involves beating a goose with a stick i 'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get here and this is the painting the best is yet to come so in a second again in new but what if you want to see brush strokes and what if you want to see and i 'm really going to get to the cracks never seen like this before i 'm going to show you my other favorite feature there 's a lot of other stuff here but i don 't have time this is the real cool if you have you go in and i 've created this called the power of zoom you can just zoom around this is the ambassadors it doesn 't in my opinion even come from the museums i probably shouldn 't say that and that 's been my humbling experience in this i mean i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online and the biggest question i get asked nowadays is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum and the answer is no it 's to supplement the experience and that 's it"
