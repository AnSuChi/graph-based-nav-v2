  "transcript": "twelve years ago i founded zipcar zipcar buys cars instead of owning their own cars each zipcar replaces but what zipcar really did was make sharing the norm and so a couple years ago i moved to paris with my husband and youngest child instead of investing in a car we invest in a community we bring the power of a corporation some people call this but that is also like saying that it 's the same thing as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting that 's peer to peer or craft fairs are the same thing as etsy but what 's really happening is that we 've got the power of a free and open internet and on top of that we 're putting a platform for participation and each strengthening the other and doing what the other can 't do i call this peers inc the incorporated the company is doing things that it does really well long term resource investment and for individuals consumers it 's bringing the standards rules and recourse that we really want as consumers and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do what do they bring they bring this fabulous diversity expensive for companies and what does that deliver it delivers localization and customization specialization and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there it 's natural for me me and my friends i can connect to them and it also delivers really fabulous innovation so we have the peers that are providing the services and the product and the company that 's doing the stuff that companies do the two of these are delivering the best of both worlds some of my favorite examples in transportation and just think they didn 't have to lay a track or buy a car this is all happening with excess capacity and it 's not just with transportation my love but of and not just easy things that anyone can do this peers inc concept is in a very difficult and complex realm when i talked to their ceo he had this great line he said we have a community that owns its own company etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they 're selling it in a marketplace it just celebrated its seventh after seven years last year it delivered five hundred and thirty million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects i know you guys out there who are businesspeople are thinking oh my god i want to build one of those i see this incredible speed and scale you mean all i have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and i sit back and roll it in building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do i think of the difference of so let me take you back how it 's so incredibly different building buzzcar than it was building zipcar because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that i have to be thinking about the owners who are going to provide the cars and the drivers who are going to rent them every single decision i have to think about what is right for both sides there are many many examples and i 'll give you one that is not my favorite example insurance it took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative they 'd never thought of it before and the result was that we were able to provide owners and what do they need they need a low low deductible and 24 hour roadside assistance so so now i want to take you to the moment of when you 're an entrepreneur and you 've started a new company there 's the here 's all the stuff we do beforehand and then the service launches what happens so all those months of work they come into play last june one we launched it was an exciting moment all the owners are adding their cars it 's really exciting all the drivers are becoming members it 's excellent the reservations start coming in and here isn 't that great yes or no like a huge proportion of them they just signed up to reply the whole point of industrial production is to provide a standardized exact service model but what does peer production do peer production is this completely different way of doing things and you have they figured out early on we need to have ratings and commentaries and all that yucky so going back and what 's that that is the diversity of what 's going on you have these different fabulous owners and their different cars and they look different and really i love these photos every time i look at them and here is selma who i love this driver and after a year we have one thousand cars that are parked across france and six thousand people who are members and eager to drive them back to this spectrum so what 's happening is we had the yuck side but we actually had this real wow side and i can tell you two great stories and said and this is where the best fish restaurant is and so at the last minute people can a driver can say hey you know what i really need the car is it available and that person will say sure my wife 's at home go pick up the what happens is you might have ten people who are in charge of innovation or one hundred people who are in charge of innovation inc companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model and so out of all that influence and that effort you are having this this exceptional amount of of innovation that is coming out so one of the reasons if we come back to why did i call it buzzcar i wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to and for me inc provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems all we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation nontrivial so i continue to think but there are all these other areas that are these profound big problems that i know that we can work on and people are working on them in many different sectors but there 's this really fabulous group of things with the power of this peers"
