  "transcript": "my investigations into what technology means in our lives not just our immediate life but in the cosmic sense in the kind of long history i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out and one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology and in the united states there is a state of the union address given by every president since one thousand seven hundred and ninety and each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the united states at that time if you search for the word technology it was not used until one thousand nine hundred and fifty two technology was sort of absent from everybody 's thinking until one thousand nine hundred and fifty two which happened to be the year of my birth and obviously technology had existed before then but we weren 't aware of it and so it was sort of an awakening of this force was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum a course bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts and industry and he called it technology and that 's the very first use of the word so what is this stuff and bothered alan kay calls it technology is anything that was invented after you were born which is sort of the it 's not roads or penicillin or factory tires it 's the new stuff my friend danny hillis says kind of a similar one he says technology is anything that doesn 't work yet which sense that it 's all new but we know that it 's just not new it actually goes way back and what i want to suggest is it goes a another way to think about technology what it means is to imagine a world without technology if we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today and i mean everything from blades to scrapers to cloth we would die by the billions and very quickly the wolves would get us but they had some technology and if we study those hunter gatherer tribes and the neanderthal which are very similar to early man we there are very few young infants because they die high mortality rate and there 's very few old people and so the profile is sort of for your average san francisco tribes and early man is is that you didn 't live beyond the age of thirty so it was a world without grandparents it 's so short and there 's nobody to pass on but at the same time anthropologists know that most hunter gatherer tribes of the world with that very little technology actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food that they needed three to six hours a day some anthropologists call that the original because they had banker hours basically so it was possible to to get enough food but when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came then people went into starvation and that 's why they didn 't live very long so what technology brought through the very simple tools like these stone tools here even something as small as this the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction and fire was used to clear out and again affected the ecology of grass and whole continents and was used in cooking it enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things it was sort of in a certain sense in a mcluhan sense an external stomach in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise and if we don 't have fire we actually could not live our bodies have adapted to these new diets our bodies have changed in the last ten the number of humans exploded and very quickly became the dominant species on the planet and they migrated into the rest of the world at two kilometers per year until within several tens of thousands of years we occupied every single watershed on the planet and became the most dominant species with a very small amount of technology and even at that time with the introduction of agriculture already small amounts of technology were transforming the world and what this means and where i 'm going is that technology has become the most powerful force in the world all the things that we see today that are changing our lives we can always trace back to the introduction of some new technology so it 's a force that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet and and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we 've invented so we 've invented ourselves of all the animals that we have domesticated the most important animal that we 've domesticated has been us it 's a very very strong force i call this that 's this world my working definition of technology is anything useful but it 's also law and of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us in that they are part of this thread that starts at the big bang and goes through galaxies and stars into life into us and the three major phases of the early universe was energy when the dominant force was energy then it became the dominant force as it cooled became you put energy into the right kind of system which is but we do know that the trend throughout the universe is long and it began with things like galaxies they maintained their order for themselves for billions of years this order against the entropy of the world and flowers and plants are the same thing extended and technology is basically an extension of life one trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this is actually increasing the amount of energy energy is and that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life is actually greater than a star because of the star 's long lifespan the energy density in life is actually higher than a star and the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip there is more energy flowing through per gram per second we continue that trajectory and we say well what 's going to become more energy dense that 's where it 's going and so what i 've done is i 've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say what are the general trends in evolutionary life and there are things moving towards greater complexity moving towards greater diversity moving towards greater specialization those very same things are also present in fact technology is accelerating all the aspects of life and we can see that happening just as there 's diversity in life there 's more diversity in things we make it 's a branching off from the human form but technology has its own agenda like anything like life itself for instance right now of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself in transportation it 's not to move us it 's to move the stuff that we make or buy i use the word want technology wants this is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power your cat wants more food a bacterium which has no consciousness at all wants to move towards light it has an if we discount the cost of that and that 's the thing that bothers most people is that progress i did a survey of a number of species of artifacts in my house and there 's six thousand other people have come up with ten thousand but that was the entire wealth of england and with that entire wealth of england king henry could not buy any antibiotics he could not buy refrigeration he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles whereas this rickshaw wale in india could save up and buy antibiotics and he could buy refrigeration that 's what progress is about that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do and sometimes it 's going to do things for us right now the default position about when a new technology comes along is we people talk about the precautionary principle stop until it can be proven you try it out you obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests you try to anticipate it but after we prioritize risk we evaluate not just the new nuclear energy fission is but it may be a pretty good idea relocated into the response to a bad idea is not no ideas it 's not to stop thinking the response to a bad idea like say a tungsten light bulb better ideas is really always the response to technology that we don 't like is basically technology is a kind of there 's nothing better to eliminate malaria besides mosquito nets but that 's a really good idea that 's a good job for technology every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job that 's actually my son right here there are no bad technologies just as there are no bad children we don 't say children are neutral children are positive we just have to find them the right place and so what over the sort of extended evolution from the beginning of time through the invention of it 's increasing diversity it 's increasing options it 's that 's what we get from technology all the time that 's why people leave villages and go into cities is because they are always gravitating towards increased choices and possibilities and we are aware of the price we pay a price for that but we are aware of it and generally we will pay the price for increased freedoms choices and opportunities even wants clean water is technology diametrically opposed to nature because technology is an extension of life it 's in parallel and aligned with the same things that life wants if we allow it to great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go and our so to speak in technology is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves"
