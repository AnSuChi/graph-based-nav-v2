  "transcript": "i was trying to think about my career since i left the white house and the best example i have is a cartoon in the new yorker a couple of years ago this little boy is looking up at his father and he says daddy when i grow up i want to be a former president i have had a great blessing as a former president because i have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe not only am i familiar with the fifty states in the united states but also my wife and i have visited more than one hundred and forty five countries full time programs in eighty nations on earth lot of times when we go into a country we not only the meet the king or the president but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas and knowing the world as i do i can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on earth addressed quite often is the abuse of women and girls first of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures holy scriptures quran and so forth and these have been misinterpreted by men and they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of god this is a very serious problem it 's ordinarily not addressed a number of years ago in the year two thousand i had been a baptist southern baptist for seventy years i tell you i still teach sunday school every sunday i 'll be teaching this sunday as well but the southern baptist convention in the year two thousand decided that women should play a secondary position a subservient position to men that prevents women from deacons in the church or chaplains in the military and if a woman teaches a classroom they cannot teach if a boy is in the room but the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position that is because men can why should i treat them the other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence and that is increasing tremendously around the world in the united states of america for instance we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people mostly black people and and minorities by putting them in prison nowadays seven point three people per one thousand are in prison that 's a sevenfold increase and since i left the white house there 's been an eight hundred percent increase in the number of women we also have [ one of the only countries ] on earth that still has the death that is a developed country and we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights we 're in california now and i figured out the other day that california has spent four billion dollars in convicting thirteen people for the if you add that up that 's three hundred and seven million dollars it costs california to send a person to be executed nebraska this week just passed a law because it costs so much so the resort to to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause let me just go down a very few abuses of women that that concern me most and i 'll be fairly brief because i have a limited amount of time as you know one is genital mutilation but when a child is born that 's a girl very soon in her life her genitals are completely cut away by remove the exterior parts of a woman 's genitalia they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate and then later when she gets married the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex this is not a rare thing although it 's against the law in most countries in egypt for instance ninety one percent of all the females that live in egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way in some countries it 's more than ninety eight percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity this is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries where a family with misinterpretation again of a holy scripture there 's nothing in the quran that mandates this will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her and this is done by members of her own family so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so called disgrace to the family an analysis was done in egypt not so long ago by the united nations and it showed that seventy five percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father the uncle or the or human trafficking it there were about twelve point five million people sold from africa into slavery in the new world back in the 19th century and the 18th century there are thirty million people now living in slavery the united states department of state now has a mandate from congress to to a report every year and the state department reports that eight hundred thousand people are sold across international borders every year into slavery and that eighty percent of those sold are women into sexual slavery atlanta georgia where the carter center is located and where i teach at emory university they have between two hundred and three hundred women people sold into slavery every month it 's the number one place in the nation because of that atlanta has the busiest airport in the world and they also have a lot of passengers that come from from the southern hemisphere if a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin they can do it for girl brings several times more than that and the average brothel owner in atlanta and in the united states now can earn about $ thirty five thousand per slave the sex trade in atlanta georgia exceeds the total drug trade and the basic problem is prostitution because there 's not a whorehouse in america that 's not known by the local officials the local policemen or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth and this leads to one of the worst problems and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world sweden has got a good approach to it about fifteen to twenty years ago sweden decided to change the law and women are but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted and prostitution has gone down in the united states we take just the opposite position for every male arrested for illegal sex trade twenty five women are arrested in the united states of america and other countries are moving now towards this so called swedish model that 's another thing that can be done we have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire our military they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization a ship like my submarine or a battalion in the army or a company in the marines has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not and of course the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command sexual assaults are taking place so they do not do it that law needs to be changed and this is now getting a lot of publicity partially because of my book but other things and so eighty nine universities in america are now condemned by the department of education under title ix because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault the department of justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists those are the kinds of things that go on in our in our society another thing that 's very serious about about the abuse of of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal partially because i was president and so forth but in the last fifteen years there 's been no progress made so it 's been just about twenty three or twenty four percent difference for the last fifteen years these are the kind of things that go on if you take the fortune five hundred companies out of five hundred and those ceos i need not tell you make less on an average than the other we have been to war with about twenty five different countries since the second world war sometimes we 've had soldiers on the ground fighting the other times we 've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people other times of course now since the second world war there was four years i won 't say which ones where we didn 't we didn 't drop a bomb we didn 't launch a missile we didn 't fire a bullet the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes are the basic causes there 's one more basic cause that i need not mention and that is that in general men don 't give a damn that 's i 'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts when separate but equal had existed racial discrimination legally had existed for one hundred years from end of the war between the states the civil war all the way up to there were many white people that didn 't think that racial discrimination because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs and that 's the same thing that exists today because the average man really doesn 't care even though they say i 'm against discrimination against girls and women they enjoy a privileged position and it 's very difficult to get the and the majority of men that control the great religions i would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one and where you come from europe and so forth who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and the average woman in egypt doesn 't have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated that every woman here will get your husbands to"
