  "transcript": "have a pretty simple idea that i 'm just going to tell you over and over until i get you to believe it and that is all of us are makers i really believe that all of us we 're born we have this ability we use words like grasp metaphorically to also think about understanding things we create things well i 'm going to show you a group of makers from maker faire and various places it doesn 't come out particularly well but that 's a particularly tall bicycle and this is a and the question he had is can i do it can it be done apparently it can so makers are enthusiasts they 're we have begun organizing makers at our maker faire there was one held in detroit here last summer and it will be held again next summer at the henry ford but we hold them in san francisco and it 's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation but it 's a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc so imagine a kid am i going to get wet am i going to get wet no i didn 't get wet am i going to get wet am i going to get wet that 's the experience of a clever ride we have fashion people are remaking things into fashion i don 't know if this is called a basket bra but it ought to be something like that we have art students now this one takes a little bit of explaining you know what those are right now the background is the guy who did this is a physicist and here he 'll explain a little bit about what it came up from houston last year to visit us in detroit here and show the if you raise your hand that 's a pretty good but there 's some of you out there that won 't admit that you 're makers and again think about it you 're makers of food you 're makers of lots of different things and partly what interests me today is you 're makers of your own world and particularly the role that technology has in your in your life makers are in control that 's what fascinates them that 's why they do what they do they want to figure out how things work they want to get access to it and they want to control it they want to use it to their own purpose they 're not mainstream they 're a little bit radical they 're a bit subversive in what they do but at one time and i found this old we gather we form and we fashion makers and shapers and put it togetherers dd so it goes on to show you people making things out of wood a grandfather making a ship in a bottle a woman making a pie somewhat standard fare of the day now i 'm going to tell you one funny thing about this this particular reel it 's an so i like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this plus psycho this is andrew archer i met andrew at one of our community meetings putting together maker faire andrew had moved to detroit from duluth minnesota he 's just a kid that grew up his mother gave him a part of the garage and he collected things from yard sales and he made stuff and he began when i sat down next to him he was telling me about a company he formed and he was building some and there 's about three hackerspaces or more in detroit and there 's probably even some new ones since i 've been here last but these are like clubs they 're sharing tools sharing space sharing expertise in in what to make and so it 's a very interesting phenomenon that 's going across the world but essentially these are people that are they 're playing to discover now the other thing that i think is is taking off another reason making is taking off today is there 's some great new tools out there and you can 't see this very well on the screen but arduino arduino is an open source hardware platform it 's a micro controller and here 's an example of one and i don 't know if you can see it that well but that 's a mailbox so an ordinary mailbox and an arduino so you figure out how to you put this now that could be a dog door it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn 't like a little brother into a little sister 's room there 's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that now here 's something a 3d printer that 's another tool that 's really taken off really really interesting this is makerbot but they 're going to figure it out they will only figure it out by getting their hands on and playing with it one of the coolest things is makerbot sent out an upgrade some new brackets for the the box well you printed out the brackets and do interesting things they 're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think the military is doing drones well there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes or vehicles something that you could program to fly on its own without a stick or anything to figure out what path it 's going fascinating work they 're doing this is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space in fact these guys actually work for nasa and they 're trying to pioneer using off the shelf components cheap things that aren 't specialized that they can combine and send up into space and he says i could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free but it 's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries even like henry ford come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups well if i haven 't convinced you that you 're a maker i hope i could convince you that our next generation should be makers that kids and we 've got to get this into schools or into communities in many many ways the ability to to tinker to shape and reshape the world around us thank you very much"
