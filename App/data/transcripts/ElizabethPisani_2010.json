  "transcript": "stupid things that 's what spreads hiv i 'm curious show of hands who agrees with it well one or two brave souls this is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who 's been in field of hiv for fifteen years worked on four continents and you 're looking at her and i am now going to argue that this is only half true but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons now rational and if you put your public health nerd glasses on you 'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what 's good for them and what 's bad for them if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information and a little bit of motivation wonderful that 's poverty and gender inequality and if you were at ted ' seven it 's about coffee prices and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational they are erections and addiction laughter so let 's start with what 's i remember speaking to an indonesian friend of mine frankie we were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in bali for a drug injection and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his and the guy whose whose birthday it was was filled up the fit and he went down and started injecting people he injects the first guy and then he 's wiping i 'm number twenty two in line and i can see the needle coming down towards me and there is blood all over the place it 's getting blunter and blunter and a small part of my brain is thinking please let there be some left ' and then telling me this story frankie said you know god drugs really make you stupid and you know you can 't fault him for accuracy but i 'm a scientist and i don 't like to make data out of anecdotes so let 's look at some data we talked to six hundred drug addicts in three cities in nearly one hundred percent yeah by sharing needles and do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that oh yeah hundred percent we 're smackheads we know where to get clean needles so are you carrying a needle we 're actually interviewing people on the street in the places where they 're hanging out and taking drugs are you carrying clean needles one in four so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in ten and the other want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you 're sleeping with there 's just kind of an ick factor there no we share needles because we don 't want to go to jail so in indonesia at this time if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up they could put you into jail and that changes the equation slightly doesn 't it because your choice now is either i use my own needle now or i could use my own needle now and they think it 's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they 'll probably end up in frankie 's situation and expose themselves to hiv now let 's look at it from a policy maker 's point of view this is a really easy problem for once your incentives are aligned we 've got what 's rational for public health so we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest now the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well known bleeding heart liberal margaret thatcher and other countries followed suit australia the netherlands and few others and in all of those countries you can see not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with hiv moscow jakarta we 're talking at its peak one in two injectors infected margaret thatcher didn 't do this because she has any great love for junkies she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service so if she didn 't invest in effective prevention if i take out my public health nerd glasses here it seems like a where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens we 've taken a very different approach so these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety mucks of the scientific pantheon in the united states and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective quite a lot of them now the ones that show that needle programs aren 't effective you think that 's one of these annoying dynamic slides and i 'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it 's going to come up but no that 's the whole slide except that wait a minute politicians so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this so it becomes quite rational to to deny services to injectors now let 's talk about are we any more rational about sex well i 'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the catholic church who think somehow that if you give out condoms everyone 's going to run out and have sex i don 't know if pope benedict watches tedtalks online but if you do i 've got news for you benedict i carry so it depends on how much virus and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time ten or twelve years you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection but basically nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic aids this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups and that 's considered stigmatizing i 've always been a bit curious about that because i think stigma is a bad thing whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing but we 'll leave that be the truth is that twenty years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time and those groups are globally people who sell sex and their more regular partners they are gay men on the party scene who have on average three times more partners than straight people on the party scene and they and almost all of those countries are in east or southern you can see these horrifying figures from africa these are all countries in southern africa where between one the rest of the world we 've got basically nothing going on in the general population very very low levels but we have extraordinarily high levels of hiv in these other populations who are at highest risk drug injectors sex workers and gay men and you 'll note that 's the local you can only hiv by having unprotected sex with a positive person we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex condom use rates are between eighty and one hundred percent in commercial sex in most countries and again because of an alignment of the incentives what 's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it 's really bad for business to have another sti but in intimate relations it 's much more difficult because with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things and nothing is quite so unromantic as the my condom or yours darling question so in the face of that you really need quite a strong incentive gentleman is called joseph he 's from haiti and he has aids but he is a reminder in the population of why you might want to be using this is also in haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex perhaps funnily enough this is also joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment not for nothing do we call it the lazarus effect but it is changing the equation of what 's rational in sexual so what we 've got some people say oh it doesn 't matter very much because actually treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit hiv if you do start treatment when you 're sick well what happens your viral load comes down but compared to what what happens if you 're not on treatment you die so your viral load goes to zero and all of this green stuff here including the spikes which are because you couldn 't get to the pharmacy or you ran out of drugs or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs or because you 've started to get resistance or whatever all of that is virus that wouldn 't be out there except for treatment now am i saying oh well great prevention strategy let 's just stop treating people of course not of course not we need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can but what i am doing is calling into question those people who say we need that 's simply not necessarily true and i think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on fifteen years now and what we 've seen is that actually condom use rates which were very very high the gay community responded very rapidly to hiv extremely little help from public health nerds i would say that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really one is the assumption of oh well if he 's infected he 's probably on meds and his viral load 's going to be low so i 'm pretty safe aids was a disfiguring disease that killed you and hiv is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day whatever if we look at the data we can see that the answer to that question is mmm so these are data from scotland you see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program then it came but in gay men you 've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available this is of new infections what does that mean it means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population more people living longer healthier lives more likely to be getting laid with hiv is outweighing the effects of lower viral load what does it mean it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have is that what 's happening no and i call it the compassion conundrum we 've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days and what 's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good it doesn 't make any sense from a public health point of view ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of jakarta she 's a chick with a dick why does she do that job well of course because she 's forced into it because she doesn 't have any better option etc etc and if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a this is what factory workers earn in an hour in indonesia on average twenty cents it varies a bit province to province i do speak to sex workers fifteen thousand of them for this particular slide so it 's not a great job but for a lot of people it really is when you get to politics politicians are making no sense from the point of view of a public health nerd junkies are doing dumb things and that 's one of the glories of those ways of being rational are not independent of one another so it 's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that 's made by a politician and it 's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision we are the voters we 're not all of them of course but ted is a community of opinion leaders and everyone who 's in this and everyone who 's watching this out there on the web i think has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence it 's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what 's rational for every frankie and every ines out there but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread hiv thank you"
