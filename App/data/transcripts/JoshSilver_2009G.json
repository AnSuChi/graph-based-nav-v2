  "transcript": "i 'd like to start could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses or you 've had laser refractive surgery but it looks like i 'm guessing that it 'll be about sixty percent of the room because that 's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction the world health organization estimates well they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses the lowest estimate is one hundred and fifty million people they also which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear and the problem of poor vision and it 's a quality of life not very expensive they 're quite plentiful the problem is there aren 't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world there are just way too few eye care professionals so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about ten thousand people and that u k this is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub saharan africa in fact there are some countries in sub saharan africa where there 's one optometrist for eight million of the population and i came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this and the idea is you make eye glasses and you adjust them yourself what i want to do is to show you i shall pop this in my pocket i 'm short sighted i look at the signs at the end i can hardly see them so i can now see that man running out there i 've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription and i 've just and this technology 's been evolving i started working on it in and it 's been evolving very slowly there are about thirty thousand in use and i have a vision which i 'll share with you i have a global vision for vision and that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year two thousand and twenty to do that this is an early example of the technology the technology is being further developed how do you solve this problem you start to get into detail and on this slide i 'm basically explaining all the problems you have how do you distribute how do you work out how to fit the thing how do you have people realizing that they have if you want to know more just come have a look at our website"
