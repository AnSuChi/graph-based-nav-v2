  "transcript": "and basically what i 'd like to tell you and there are two types of changes i want to which is change of power amongst states and there the simple version of the message is it 's moving from west to east the other and i want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why in the end there may be some good news when we talk about power transition it really should be called the recovery or return of asia if we you 'd find that more than half of the world 's people lived in asia now fast forward to one thousand nine hundred the industrial revolution which meant 21st century is asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world 's population and more than half of the world 's product that 's important and it 's an important shift but let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that i 'm i 'm talking about which is power diffusion to understand power diffusion computing and communications costs have fallen if the price of an automobile you could buy a car today if you wanted to communicate from oxford to johannesburg to new delhi to brasilia and anywhere simultaneously but to be able to do it you had to be very rich maybe the catholic church now anybody has that capacity which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors they have the price of entry into an internet cafe the last time i looked it was something like a pound an hour so capabilities that were once restricted are now available to everyone and what that means is not that the age of the state is oxfam a great another non governmental actor but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts we think it 's worth noticing that a actor attacking the united states in two thousand and one killed more americans than the government of japan did in one thousand nine hundred and forty one you might think of that as the now the problem is that we so let me step back and ask what 's power power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want and you can do it in three ways you can do it with threats of coercion and that soft power has been much neglected and yet it 's tremendously traditionally the way people thought about power for example the great oxford historian who taught here defined a great power and we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective now let me go back to the question of power transition between states and what 's happening there the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers and the current narrative is all about the rise of china and the decline of the united states indeed with the two thousand and eight financial crisis many people said this was the beginning of the end of american power the tectonic plates of world politics were shifting but in fact this metaphor of decline is often very misleading if you look at history in recent history you 'll see the cycles of belief in american decline come and go every ten or fifteen years or so in it was that 's the end of america in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window was the end of america in the 1980s as america went through a transition in the reagan period between but in fact what we 've seen indeed people were the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology then what we need to focus on is what 's really happening goldman sachs has projected that china the chinese economy will surpass that of the u s by two what seventeen more years to go or so but be very careful about these projections such as the goldman sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture let me mention three reasons why it 's too simple first of all it 's a linear projection you here 's the growth rate of china here 's the growth rate of the u s here it goes straight line history is accidents along the way the second thing is that which it may it that will be a measure of total economic size but not of per capita income won 't tell you about the composition of the economy china still has large areas of underdevelopment and that the chinese the other point that 's worth noticing is how this projection is you know doesn 't tell you much about military power doesn 't tell you very much about soft power and also when we think about the rise of asia or return of asia as i called it a little bit earlier it 's if you 're sitting in japan or in new delhi or in hanoi your view of the rise of china one of the advantages that the americans will have in terms of power in asia is all those countries it 's as though mexico so these simple projections of the goldman sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition you may have policies which are very dangerous let me give you an example from history peloponnesian war was the great conflict in which the greek city state system tore itself apart two and a half millennia ago what caused it notice both halves of that explanation many people argue in which the great conflagration in which the european state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world that that was caused by the rise in the power of germany and the fear it created in britain no i think that 's wrong it 's bad history for one thing germany had surpassed britain in industrial strength by one thousand nine hundred and as i said earlier china has not passed the united but also if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear it leads to overreaction and the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the east is fear to paraphrase franklin roosevelt from a different context the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself we don 't have to fear the rise of china or the return of asia and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective we 're going to be able to manage this process let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together if you ask how is power distributed in the world top board military power among states the united states is the only superpower middle board of this three dimensional chess game economic power among can balance each other the bottom board of this there nobody 's in charge it makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi polar power is chaotically distributed and the only way you can solve these problems and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century is through cooperation through working together which means that soft power becomes more important that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems we want to get away from the idea that power 's always zero sum my gain is your loss and vice versa power can also be positive sum where your gain can be my gain if china develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions so empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody and it 's not a zero sum i win hard power is there and it will remain so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this things from which all of us can benefit how do we define our national interests so that it 's not just zero sum but positive sum keeping freedom of the seas those were good for britain they were good for others as well and in the 21st century you have to do an analog to that how do we produce global public goods which are good for us there are ways to define our interests in which while protecting ourselves with hard power we can organize with others in networks but ways that will enhance our soft power so if one looks at the statements that have been made about this i am impressed that when hillary clinton described the foreign policy of the obama administration she said that the foreign policy of the obama administration was going to be smart power as she put it using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box and if we 're going to deal with these two great power shifts that i 've described the power shift represented by transition among states the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states and that 's the good news i have we can do that thank you very much"
