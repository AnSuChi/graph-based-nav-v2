  "transcript": "i am a pediatric cancer doctor inspired by jill bolte taylor last year i didn 't bring a but i did bring a liter of bone marrow so a few years ago i 'm doing my transplant fellowship at stanford i 'm we have bob here who is a volunteer donor we 're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child and and the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue and kind of punch it into the hard bone into the tuchus that 's a technical term and aspirate about ten mls of bone marrow out and we do that again and again and by the end of this my arm is sore i 've got a callus on my hand let alone bob whose rear end looks something more like this like swiss cheese and there is probably a better way to do this so i thought of a minimally invasive approach and a new device that we call the marrow miner and we have a flexible powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip as it moves around so it enables you to very rapidly aspirate or suck out rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole we can do multiple passes i got a small little grant at stanford and played around with this a little bit and our team members developed this technology and eventually we got two large animals and and we found to our surprise that we not only got bone marrow out but we got ten times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the marrow miner compared to the normal device this device was just fda approved in the last year here is a live patient you can see it following the flexible curves around there will be two passes here in the same patient from the same hole so why should you care bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells you all know about embryonic which we 've been using as a form of stem cell therapy for over forty years orthopedics tissue engineering even in neurology to treat parkinson 's and diabetes which translates to better outcomes it may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live saving bone marrow donors it may even even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells when you 're younger and healthier to use in the future should you need it hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future thanks"
