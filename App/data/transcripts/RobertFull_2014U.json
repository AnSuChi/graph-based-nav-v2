  "transcript": "even nature 's most disgusting creatures have important secrets but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates robust systems are stable in complex and new environments we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them no problem and not here 's a new behavior we 've discovered they can run upside down very rapidly on rods branches and wires and if you perturb one of those branches they can do this they can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot and they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access to a variety of different areas they have wings for flying when they get warm but they use those same wings to flip over if they get destabilized robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail safe they can still go over rough terrain like the bottom video that you see without hardly slowing down here 's an animal using a normal alternating here 's one moving with two middle legs gone and i point out that all of these videos are slowed down twenty times here 's an animal climbing up a wall it looks like a and they can do this in part because they have and they 're really just made up of compliant my engineering colleague at berkeley designed with his students a novel manufacturing technique where you essentially origami the exoskeleton you you laser cut it laminate it and you fold it up into a robot and you can do that now in less than fifteen minutes and they 're remarkably robust as a result of these features they 're certainly incredibly damage they even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches so they can use their smart compliant body to transition up a wall in a very simple way they even have some of the beginnings of the rapid inversion behavior where they disappear now we want to know why they can go anywhere we although you never see it we put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis and showed that they can withstand forces curiosity based research will lead cockroach inspired robots to come at you"
