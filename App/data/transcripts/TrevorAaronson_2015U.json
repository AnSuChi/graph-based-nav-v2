  "transcript": "the fbi is responsible for more terrorism plots in the united states than any other organization more than al qaeda more than al shabaab more than the islamic state more than all of them combined this isn 't likely how you think about the fbi you probably think of fbi agents gunning down bad guys like john dillinger or arresting corrupt politicians after the nine eleven terrorist attacks the fbi became less concerned with gangsters and crooked elected officials compare than to just public corruption and all other types of traditional criminal activity i 've spent years pouring through the case files of terrorism prosecutions in the united states and i 've come to the conclusion that the fbi is much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists in the fourteen years since nine eleven you can count about six real terrorist attacks in the united states such as the time when a man named faisal shahzad tried to deliver a car bomb to times square in those same fourteen years the bureau however has bragged about how it 's foiled dozens of terrorism plots in all the fbi has arrested more than one hundred and and sometimes even the idea for mentally ill and economically desperate people to become what we now term terrorists after nine eleven the fbi was given an edict never again never another attack on american soil fbi agents were told to find terrorists before they struck to do this agents recruited a network of more than fifteen thousand informants nationwide all looking for anyone who might be dangerous an informant can earn one hundred thousand dollars or more for every terrorism case they bring to the fbi that but mostly muslim american communities both are mentally ill abdul latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder he had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy in two thousand and twelve the fbi arrested these two men for conspiring to attack a military recruiting station outside seattle with weapons provided of course by the the fbi 's informant was robert childs a convicted rapist and child molester who was paid ninety thousand dollars for his work on the case the lead defendant was james cromitie a broke walmart employee with a history of mental problems and the informant had offered him two hundred and fifty thousand dollars if he participated in that plot there are many more examples osmakac a young man who was living near tampa florida handed him money introduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist and lured him in a the lead undercover agent you can see him in this picture with his face blurred would go back to the tampa field office with his recording equipment on behind closed doors fbi agents admitted that what they were doing was farcical a federal judge doesn 't want you to hear about these conversations he sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from the lead agent the squad supervisor described their would be terrorist as a retarded fool who didn 't have a pot to piss in wishy washy and they gave him a car bomb they gave him and they even gave him money for a taxi cab so that he could get to where they wanted him to go the squad supervisor tells his agents and he got a hollywood ending osmakac attempted to deliver what he thought was a car bomb he was arrested convicted and sentenced to forty years in prison sami osmakac isn 't alone he 's one of more than one hundred and for whom the fbi has created hollywood endings u s government officials call this the war on terror it 's really just theater a national security theater with mentally ill men like sami thank you tom rielly so those are some pretty strong accusations pretty strong charges assistant and i put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions at the time during the first decade after nine eleven and we we used the court file to find out whether the defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups whether an informant was used and whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur by providing the means and opportunity and we submitted that to the fbi and we asked them to respond to our database if they believed there were any errors and on appearances on places like cbs and npr they were offered that opportunity again to say trevor aaronson 's findings are wrong and they 've never come forward and said these are the problems with with those findings so the data has since been used by groups like human rights watch on its recent report on these types of sting operations and so far the fbi has never really responded to these charges that it 's really not catching terrorists so much as it 's catching mentally ill people that it can dress up as terrorists in these types of sting operations tr tell us about your article the intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this because my article is really leveraging the fact that a source had leaked to me transcripts of these private fbi conversations that a federal judge so a place like the intercept was set up to protect tells the story of how osmakac was set up in this fbi sting and goes into much greater detail in this talk i could only highlight the things that they said such as calling him a retarded fool but it was much more elaborate which he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent when he went to trial the central piece of evidence was that he paid for these weapons when in truth these transcripts show how the fbi orchestrated someone who was essentially mentally ill and broke to get money to then pay for weapons that they could then charge him in a conspiracy for tr the fbi arrested some potential isis suspects in brooklyn saying that they might be headed to syria and were those real or examples of more of the same ta well so far we only know what 's come out in the court file but they seem to suggest it 's another example of the same these types of sting operations have moved from flavor to flavor so initially it was al qaeda plots and now the islamic state is the current flavor what 's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged only began the plot to go to syria after the introduction of the fbi informant and in fact the fbi informant had helped them with the travel documents that they needed in kind of a comical turn in that particular case one of the defendant 's mother had found out that he was interested in going to syria and had hid his passport so it 's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport that he ever could have gone anywhere so yes there are people who might be interested in joining the islamic state in the united states and those are people that the united states government should be looking at to see if they 're interested in violence here in this particular case given the evidence that 's so far come out it suggests the fbi made it possible for these guys to move along in a plan to go to syria when they were never close to that in the first place tr thanks a lot that 's amazing"
