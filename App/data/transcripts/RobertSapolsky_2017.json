  "transcript": "robert spent the last few years think about how weird human behavior is and how inadequate most of our language trying to explain it is and it 's very exciting to hear him explain some of the thinking behind it in public for the first time thank you the fantasy always runs something like this burst into his secret bunker with my machine gun ready he snarls comes at me with otherworldly strength we grapple we fight i manage to pin him down and put on handcuffs adolf hitler i say i arrest you for crimes against humanity what would i do if i had hitler it 's not hard to imagine once i allow myself sever his spine at the neck and then inject him with something cancerous that 's going to fester until every second feels like an eternity in hell and when i do my heart speeds up but there 's a problem which is i don 't actually believe in souls or evil but there 's some people i would like to see killed but but i 'm for strict gun control but then there was a time i was at a laser tag place and i had such a good time hiding in a corner shooting at people in other words i 'm your basic confused human when it comes to violence now as a species we obviously have problems with violence we use shower heads to deliver poison gas letters with anthrax airplanes as weapons mass rape as a military strategy we 're a miserably violent species but and when it 's the right kind we vote for we mate with our champions of it when it 's the right kind of violence we love it so how do you make sense of the biology of our best behaviors our worst ones and all of those ambiguously in between what 's totally pulling a trigger is an appalling act in others it 's heroically in some settings putting your hand one someone else 's is deeply compassionate and that 's real tough one thing that 's clear though is you 're not going to get anywhere if you think there 's going to be the brain region or the hormone or the gene or the childhood experience or the evolutionary mechanism that explains everything instead every bit let 's look at an example you have a gun there 's a crisis going on rioting violence people running around a stranger is running at you in an agitated state you can 't quite tell if the expression is frightened threatening angry holding something that kind of looks like a handgun you 're not sure the and it turns out that thing in this person 's hand was a cell phone and this brings us into the realm initiates volleys of cascades that produce pulling what was the level of activity in your amygdala one second before obviously the sights the sounds of the rioting that was pertinent but in addition you 're more likely to mistake a cell phone for a handgun if that stranger was male part of the brain whose job it is to get to the amygdala in time saying are you really sure that 's a gun there but we need to step further back and with this we have entered the realm of hormones for example testosterone where regardless of your sex if you have elevated testosterone levels in your blood you 're more likely to think a face with a neutral expression is instead looking threatening testosterone levels elevated levels of stress hormones and your amygdala is going to be more active and your frontal cortex will be more sluggish the fact that your brain can change in response to experience and if your previous months have been filled with stress and trauma your amygdala but we push back even more back years back for example to your adolescence now the central fact of the adolescent brain is all of it is going full blast except twenty five but pushing back even further even further back to childhood and fetal life and all the different versions that that could come in now obviously that 's the time that your brain and as an example of this if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot of stress hormones through because genes work differently in different environments key example here there 's a variant of a gene called and if you have that variant you are far more likely to commit antisocial violence if and only if you were abused as a child and what 's happening in that one second before you pull that trigger reflects your lifetime of those back centuries what were your ancestors up to they were nomadic pastoralists they were pastoralists people living in deserts or grasslands with their herds of camels cows goats and amazingly centuries later but we 've got to push even further back back millions of years because if we 're talking about genes implicitly we 're now talking about the evolution of genes patterns across different primate species some of them have evolved for extremely low levels of aggression others have evolved in the so what has this gotten us to basically what we 're seeing here is if you want to understand a behavior whether it 's an appalling one a wondrous one or confusedly in between if you want to understand that you 've got take into account what happened a second before to a million years before everything in between and you 'd better be real careful real cautious before you conclude you know what causes a behavior especially if it 's a behavior you 're judging harshly now to me the single most important point about all of this is one having to do with change every bit of biology i have mentioned here can change in different circumstances the sahara was a lush grassland the most terrifying people in europe were the swedes rampaging all over the place this is what the swedish military does now they haven 't had a war in two hundred years everything in the brain changes and first one this is a man named john newton a british theologian who played a central role in the abolition of slavery from the british empire in the early 1800s and then as an investor in slavery growing rich and then something changed something changed in him something that newton himself celebrated in the thing that he 's most famous for a hymn that he wrote amazing grace and this is the same man fifty years later to the day hugging a man and as an old man came to a collection of pearl harbor survivors at a ceremony there and in halting english apologized for what he had done as a young man extraordinary change could happen in just hours and then praying and then having christmas together and exchanging gifts and by the next day they were playing soccer together and exchanging addresses so they could meet after the war that truce kept going until the officers had to arrive and said we will shoot you unless you go back to trying to kill each other and all it took here was hours for these men and who is a them those faceless powers behind the lines who were using them as pawns and sometimes change can occur in seconds probably the most horrifying event in the vietnam war was the my lai massacre a brigade of american soldiers went into an undefended village full of civilians and killed between three hundred and fifty and five hundred of them it was appalling it was appalling because it occurred because the government denied it because the us government eventually did nothing more than a slap on the wrist and appalling because it almost certainly was not a singular event he was piloting a helicopter gunship landed there got out and saw american soldiers shooting babies shooting old women figured out what was going on and he then took his helicopter and did something that undid his lifetime of conditioning as to who is an us and who is a them he landed his helicopter in between some surviving villagers and american soldiers and he trained his machine guns on his fellow americans and said if you don 't stop the killing i will mow you down now these people are no more special than any of us same neurons same same biology what we 're left with here is this inevitable cliche those who don 't study history are destined to what we have here is the opposite of it those who don 't study the history of extraordinary human change those who don 't study the biology of what can transform us from our worst to our best behaviors those who don 't do this are destined not to be able to repeat these incandescent magnificent moments thank you so much"
