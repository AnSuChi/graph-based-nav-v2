  "transcript": "but since then much progress has been made both our lab and other labs around the world and given this we started getting questions like if you can grow human body parts can you also grow animal products like meat but what i soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all what 's crazy is what we do today i 'm convinced that in thirty years when we look back on today and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals to make our hamburgers and our handbags we 'll see this as being wasteful did you know that today we maintain a global herd of sixty billion animals to provide our meat over the next few decades as the world 's population expands to ten billion this will need to nearly double to one hundred billion animals fresh water and one of the biggest of greenhouse gases which drive climate change on top of this when you get so many animals so close together there is another way essentially animal products are just collections of tissues and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues we started with what the tissues are made of the basic unit of life the cell already in medicine biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts like and we should begin by reimagining leather and it has long been a part of our history and it is largely two dimensional it is clear that initially at least more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods no matter how delicious in this sense leather is a gateway material a beginning if we can succeed here it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat we begin by taking cells from an animal through a simple biopsy we then isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a cell culture medium this takes millions of cells and expands them into billions and we then coax these cells to produce collagen as they would naturally this collagen is the stuff between cells it 's natural connective tissue it and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another like phyllo pastry and finally we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process we create leather and so i 'm very excited to show you for the first time the first batch fresh from the lab this is it can have all the characteristics of leather there is no and no waste this leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet a handbag and because we make this material we grow this leather from the ground up we can control its properties in very interesting ways this piece of leather it is nearly layers thick and quite opaque you don 't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather and we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities like elasticity and even things like pattern we can mimic nature but in some ways also improve upon it probably much more what could the future of animal products look like it need not look like this which is actually the state of the art it could be much more like this and speaking of food and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful sterile facilities like this a brewery is essentially a bioreactor instead of brewing beer we were brewing leather or meat open and educational and this is in contrast to the hidden guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today perhaps biofabrication efficient we can design new materials new products and we need to move past just killing animals perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured thank you"
