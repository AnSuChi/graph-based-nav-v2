  "transcript": "kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all electric car elon i thought about what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity independent of environmental concerns we need to find some sustainable means of how can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help em right so if you take say natural and the reason is in the stationary power plant you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more even after you 've taken transmission loss into account and everything even using the same source fuel you 're at least twice as better off charging an electric car then burning it at the power plant ca that scale delivers efficiency em we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway electricity generation so given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation then it makes sense for us to have electric as the mode of transport ca so we 've got some video here of of the tesla being assembled which if we could play that that first video so what what is innovative about this process in this vehicle em so in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport and i should say that i think actually all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets there 's just no way around newton 's third law the you have to come up with a really energy efficient car so that means making it incredibly drag coefficient of any car of its size so those battery packs are incredibly heavy but you think the math the math can still work out intelligently by combining light body heavy battery you can still gain spectacular efficiency and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range and in fact ca bruno bowden who 's that was the good news the bad news was that to do it he had to drive at eighteen miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops you can certainly drive under normal conditions two hundred and fifty miles is a reasonable number ca let 's show that second video showing the tesla in action on ice not at all a dig at the new york times is really incredible so we wanted really to have people feel as though they 've almost got to mind meld with the car so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one and as you as you corner and accelerate it just happens like the car has you can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness you can 't do that with a gasoline car i think that that 's really a profound difference and people only experience that when they have a test drive ca i mean this is a beautiful but expensive car is there a road map where this becomes a the goal of tesla has always been to have a sort of three step process where version one was an expensive car at low volume version two is so we had a $ one hundred thousand sports car which was the roadster then we 've got the model s which starts at around fifty thousand dollars and our third generation car which should hopefully be out in about three or four years and so i think we 're making progress in that direction and i feel confident that we 'll get there ca i mean right now if you 've got a short commute you can drive you can get back you can charge it at home there isn 't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast do you see that coming really truly or just on a few key routes em there actually are far more charging stations than people realize and at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology and so this is something that maybe a lot of people don 't realize we actually have california and nevada covered and we 've got the eastern seaboard from boston to d c covered by be able to drive from l a to new york just using the supercharger network which charges at five times the rate of anything else you want to stop for twenty or thirty minutes because that 's normally what people will stop for so if you start a trip at nine a m by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat hit the restroom coffee and keep going you don 't pay anything em for people to stop for about twenty to thirty minutes not for an hour it 's actually better to to drive for about maybe one hundred and sixty one hundred and seventy miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going that 's the natural cadence of a trip ca all right so this is only one string to your energy bow you 've been working on on this solar company solarcity what 's unusual about that em well as i mentioned earlier we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption i 'm quite confident that the primary means i mean it 's really indirect fusion is what it is we 've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization what most people know but don 't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely be a frozen ice ball at three degrees kelvin the whole ecosystem is solar powered ca but in a gallon of gasoline you have effectively thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space so it 's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar and to remotely you can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system most people choose to lease and the thing about solar power is that it doesn 't have any feed stock or operational costs so once it 's installed it 's just there it works for decades it 'll work for probably a century and then get the cost of the financing low because that interest those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar and we 've made huge progress in that direction and that 's why i 'm don 't pay so much up front you will then pay how long is a typical lease as you 're sort of alluding to quite straightforward it 's no money down and your utility your utility bill decreases you 'll pay less than you 're paying now for you the dream here then is that i mean who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer google is one of our big partners here and they have an expected return on that capital with that capital solarcity purchases and installs the panel on on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease which is less than the utility bill ca but you yourself get long term commercial benefit from that power you 're kind of building a new type of distributed utility em exactly what it amounts to is a giant distributed utility i think it 's a good thing because utilities and people haven 't had any choice so effectively it 's the first time there 's been competition because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines but now it 's on your roof so i think it 's actually very empowering for within a decade or two or within and i made that bet with someone ca definition of plurality is em more from solar than any other source so let 's go back to another bet that you made with yourself i guess a kind of crazy bet you 'd made some money you decided to build a space you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry the goal of spacex is to try to which is that was a dream of yours in a way from a young age you 've dreamed of mars and beyond em i did build rockets when i was a kid but i didn 't think i 'd be involved in this it was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to and i really think there 's a fundamental difference if you sort of look into the future between and i think that 's really exciting compared with with one where we are forever confined to earth until some eventual extinction event ca so you 've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by seventy five percent depending on how you calculate it how on earth have you done that been doing this for years how have you done this em well we 've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe the engines the electronics there 's a long list of of innovations that that we 've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in in this talk but the enforceability of patents is questionable ca that 's really really interesting but the big the big innovation is still ahead and you 're working on it now tell us about this so the thing about rockets is that and the parts that were reusable took so the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight obviously that doesn 't work very well for ca what just happened there we just saw something land em that 's right so it 's important that the the rocket stages be able to come back to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours so it 's possible to achieve let 's say roughly 100 fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket that 's why it 's so important every mode of transport that we use whether it 's planes trains automobiles so we must solve this problem in order to become a space faring civilization ca you asked me the question earlier of how popular traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward em certain cruises are apparently highly problematic ca definitely more so that 's potentially absolutely disruptive technology and i guess paves the way for your dream to actually take at some point to take humanity to mars at scale you 'd like to see a colony on mars em yeah exactly spacex or some combination of companies and and governments needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi planetary of establishing on another planet on mars being the only realistic option multi planet species ca so progress on this let 's make it reusable how is that going that was just a simulation video we saw how 's it going em we 've been making some good progress recently with something we call the grasshopper test project where we 're testing the vertical landing portion of of the flight the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky and we 've had some good tests ca can we see that em yeah so that 's just to give a sense of scale we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket ca all right let 's see that video then because this is actually amazing when you think about it you 've never seen this before a rocket blasting off and the pitch and yaw of the maintaining roll with cold gas thrusters projects at scale how on earth has one what is it about you em i mean is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design technology and business so if ted was tbd design technology and business into one package synthesize it in a way that very few people can and and this is the critical thing feel almost no one can do that is that could we have some of that secret sauce can we put it into our education system can someone learn from you it is truly amazing what you 've done boil things down to through most of our life we get through life by reasoning by analogy which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations but when you want to do something new you have to so i think i think that 's an important thing to do and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it particularly from friends this may sound like simple advice but study physics learn from this man elon musk i wish we had all day"
