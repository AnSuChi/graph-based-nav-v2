  "transcript": "want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship i happen to have triplets they 're little they 're five years old sometimes i tell people i have triplets i also happen to be gay being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative socially entrepreneurial thing i have ever done i want to talk about how the things we 've been taught to think but before i do that i want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play in changing the world a lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies and social business will take care of the rest and social business needs markets and there are some issues for which you just can 't develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market i sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled how do you monetize that and that 's where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in philanthropy is the market for love it is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming and so if we really want like buckminster fuller said a world that works for everyone with no one and nothing left out why have our breast cancer charities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer or our homeless charities not come and we have a belief system we have two rulebooks we have one for the nonprofit sector and one for the rest of the economic world it 's an apartheid and it discriminates against the nonprofit sector in five different areas the first being compensation so in the for profit sector the more value you produce the more money you can make but we don 't like nonprofits to use money to incentivize people to produce produce more in social service we have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people interestingly we don 't have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people you know you want to make fifty million dollars selling violent video games to kids go for it we 'll put you on the cover of wired magazine but you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria and you 're considered a and we think of this as our system of ethics but what we don 't realize is that this system has a powerful side effect mutually exclusive choice between doing very well for yourself and your family or doing good for the world to marching every year directly into the for profit sector because they 're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice and the median compensation for a stanford mba with bonus meanwhile for the same year the average salary for the ceo of that 's just because those mba types are greedy not necessarily they might be smart save fifty thousand dollars on their taxes so still be roughly two hundred and seventy thousand dollars a year ahead of the game probably sit on the board of the hunger charity indeed probably supervise the poor sob who decided to become the ceo of the hunger charity the second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing so we tell the for profit sector spend spend spend on advertising until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value but we don 't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity our attitude is well look if you can get the advertising i 'm okay with that but i don 't want my donation spent on advertising i want it go to the needy as if the money invested in advertising could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money to serve the needy we had one hundred and eighty two thousand ordinary heroes participate and they raised a total of five hundred and eighty one million dollars they raised more money more quickly for these causes than any events in history all based on the idea that people are weary of being asked to do the least they can possibly do but they have to be asked we got that many people to participate by buying full page ads in the new york times in the boston globe in prime time radio and tv advertising do you know how many people we would 've gotten if we put up fliers in the laundromat charitable giving has remained stuck in the u s at two percent of gdp ever since we started measuring it in the 1970s that 's an important fact because it tells us that in forty years the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for profit sector and nobody calls the attorney general well you and i know when you prohibit failure you kill innovation if you kill innovation in fundraising you can 't raise more revenue if you can 't raise more revenue you can 't grow and if you can 't grow you can 't possibly solve large social problems the fourth area is time so amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors and people had patience they knew that there was a but if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream of building magnificent scale that required that for six years no money was going to go to the needy it was all going to be invested in building this scale we would expect a crucifixion so the for profit sector has a lock on and the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital well you put those five things together you can 't use money to lure talent away from the for profit sector you can 't advertise on anywhere near the scale the for profit sector does for new customers you can 't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for profit sector takes for profit sector and you don 't have a stock market with which to fund any of this even if you could do it in the first place and you 've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for profit sector on every level that crossed the $ fifty million annual revenue barrier is one hundred and forty four in the same time the number of for profits that crossed it one hundred and thirty six like most the puritans came here for religious reasons or so they said but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money they were pious people but they were also really aggressive capitalists and they were accused of extreme forms of profit making tendencies so they were taught literally to hate themselves they were taught that self interest was a raging sea that was a sure path to eternal damnation this created a real problem for these people here they 've come all the way across the atlantic to make all this money but making all this money will get you sent directly to hell what were they to do about this well charity became their answer it became this economic sanctuary where they could do penance for their profit making tendencies nothing has intervened to say that 's counterproductive and that 's unfair now this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question which is what percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead there are a lot of problems with this question i 'm going to just focus on two but it absolutely is especially if it 's being used now this idea that overhead is somehow an enemy of the cause creates this second much larger problem which is it forces organizations to go without the less money you spend on fundraising the more money there is available for the cause then we have it precisely backwards and we should be investing more money not less in fundraising because fundraising is the one thing that has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply i we launched the breast cancer within just five years we had multiplied that five hundred and fifty four times into one hundred and ninety four million dollars after all expenses for breast cancer research now if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer what would make more sense go out and find the most innovative researcher in the world and give her three hundred and fifty thousand dollars for or give her fundraising department the three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to multiply it into one hundred and ninety four million dollars for breast cancer research and then we went out of business suddenly and traumatically our sponsors split on us they wanted to distance themselves from us because we were being crucified in the media for investing forty percent of the gross in recruitment and customer service and the magic of the experience and there is no accounting terminology to describe that kind of investment in growth and in the future other than this demonic label of overhead so on one day all three hundred and fifty of our great employees lost their jobs because they were labeled overhead our sponsor went and tried the events on their own the overhead went up net income for breast cancer research went down by eighty four percent or sixty million dollars but we 're missing the most important piece of information which is what is the actual size of these pies cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it 's tiny what if the bake sale only netted seventy one dollars for charity because it made no investment in its scale and the professional fundraising enterprise netted seventy one million dollars because it did here 's how all of this impacts the big picture i said that charitable giving is two percent of gdp in the united states that 's about three hundred billion dollars a year but if we could move charitable giving from two percent of gdp up just one step and if that that would represent a tripling of contributions to our generation does not want its epitaph to read we kept charity overhead low their how they measure their progress toward those dreams and what resources they need to make them come true regardless of what the is who cares what the overhead is if these problems are actually getting solved if we can have that kind of generosity a generosity of thought then the non profit sector can play a massive role in changing the world for all those citizens and if that can be our generation 's enduring legacy that we took responsibility for the thinking that had been handed down to us that we revisited it we revised it and we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things forever for everyone well i thought i would let the sum up what that would be"
