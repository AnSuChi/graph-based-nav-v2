  "transcript": "jfk told the country about a dream he had the eponymous moonshot no one knew if it was possible to do but he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible that 's how great dreams are great dreams aren 't just visions they 're visions coupled to strategies for making them real i have the incredible good fortune to work at a moonshot factory at x formerly called google x you 'll find an aerospace engineer working alongside a fashion designer and former military ops commanders brainstorming with laser experts these inventors engineers and makers and we use the word factory to remind ourselves that we want to have concrete visions concrete plans to make them real we want to find a huge problem in the world that affects many millions of people number two we want to find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem and then number three has to be some reason to believe we 've tried to make that our strength we spend most of our time breaking things and trying to prove that we 're wrong run at all the hardest parts of the problem first get excited and cheer hey how are we going to kill our project today we 've got this interesting balance going where we allow our unchecked optimism to fuel our visions but then we also harness enthusiastic skepticism breathe reality into those visions i want to show you a few of the projects that we 've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor and also a few of the gems that at least so far have not only survived that process but have been accelerated by it last year we killed a project in automated vertical farming vertical farming uses ten times less water and a hundred times less land than conventional farming and because you can grow the food close to where it 's consumed you don 't have to transport it large distances so we killed the project we pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage to ship goods worldwide the radical solution a cargo ship this has the potential to lower at least overall the cost but however cheap they would have been to make in volume it turned out that it was going to cost close to two hundred million dollars to design and build the first one two hundred million dollars is just way too expensive we can 't spend two hundred million dollars to get the first data point about whether we 're on the right track or not if there 's an achilles ' heel in one our projects we want to know it now up front so we killed this project too discovering a major flaw in a project doesn 't always mean that it ends the project sometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path this is our fully but that wasn 't actually our goal when we started with one point two million people dying and what we discovered was that our plan to have the cars do almost all the driving and just hand over to the users in case of emergency was a really bad plan it wasn 't safe because the users didn 't do their job they didn 't stay alert in case the car needed aim for a car where you 're truly a passenger you tell the car where you want to go you push a button and it takes you from point a to point b by itself we 're really grateful that we had this insight as early on in the project as we did and it 's shaped everything we 've done since then and now our cars have and they 're out everyday on the streets of mountain view california and austin texas the cars team sometimes shifting your perspective is more powerful than being smart take wind energy it 's one of my favorite examples of perspective shifting there 's no way but we found a way to get up higher into the sky and so get access to faster more consistent winds and so more energy without needing hundreds of tons of steel to get there once the tether 's all the way out it goes into crosswind circles in the sky and now those propellers the more excited we get that this could become a cheaper and more deployable form of wind energy for the world probably the craziest sounding project we have is project loon we 're trying to make internet a network of balloons in the stratosphere that beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world this could bring online as many as four billion more people who today have little or but you can 't just take and the balloons are too high up here comes the crazy moment what if instead we let the balloons drift and we taught them how to sail the winds to go where the needed to go it turns out the so we hoped that using smart algorithms and wind data from around the world we could maneuver the balloons a bit getting them to go up and down just a tiny bit in the stratosphere to grab those winds going in those different directions handing off the internet connection just like your phone hands off between cell towers as you drive down the freeway we get how crazy that vision sounds there 's the name of the project to remind so since two thousand and twelve the loon team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult and so the most likely to kill their project and i promise you there were bets that it wasn 't going to so we kept going could we get the so that people could have but now we can do up to enough to watch a ted talk check could we get balloons the size of a house to stay up for more than one while costing less than five percent of what traditional long life balloons have cost to make but we made balloons the size of a blue whale we busted a lot of balloons since one of the things that was most likely to kill the loon project was whether we could guide the balloons through the sky one of our most important experiments was putting so there are two compartments here one with air and then one with helium and these weight changes allow it to rise or fall barely at first but better all the time this particular balloon our latest balloon can navigate a two mile vertical stretch of sky we have lots more to do in terms of so we 're going to keep going our balloons today are doing pretty much everything a complete system needs to do and you 're right being audacious and working on big risky things makes people inherently uncomfortable you cannot yell at people and force them to fail fast will people laugh at me will i be fired i started with our secret i 'm going to leave you with how we actually make it happen the only way to get people to risky things audacious ideas and have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first is if you make that the path of least resistance for them we work hard at x to make it safe to fail teams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table because they 're rewarded hugs and high fives from their manager me in particular they get promoted for it we have bonused every single person we believe in dreams at the moonshot factory it unlocks the potential in every idea we can create the future that 's in our dreams thank you very much"
