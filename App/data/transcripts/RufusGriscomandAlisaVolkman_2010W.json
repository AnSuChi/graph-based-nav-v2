  "transcript": "this is where our story begins the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son declan obviously a really profound moment and it changed our lives in many ways it also changed our lives in many unexpected ways and those unexpected ways we later reflected on that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us and a year later we launched babble a website for parents rufus griscom now i think of our story as starting a few years earlier av that 's true rg you may remember we fell head over heels in love av we did rg we were at the time running a very different kind of website it was a website called in theory and hopefully in practice a smart online magazine about sex and culture av that spawned a dating site but you can understand the jokes that we get sex begets babies you follow instructions on nerve and you should end up on babble which we did and we might launch a geriatric site as our third we 'll see rg but for us the continuity between nerve and babble was not just the life stage thing which is of course relevant but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about and we 've been surprised that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex av the early years were really wonderful but they were also really difficult and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting we subscribed to a lot of magazines did our homework but really everywhere you look around we were surrounded by images went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this the sun was always streaming in and our children would never be crying i would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested it was not like that at all rg when we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at with these beautiful images and looked at the scene in our actual living room it looked a little bit more like this they 're not always crying and screaming but with three boys there 's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be we really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight we really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest and of course there are many more than four things you can 't say about parenting so the first taboo number one misuse of the pronoun alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child the voices of friends the moment they put the baby in your hands you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [ on ] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you 've ever experienced in your entire life so i was and i was ready for this mack truck of love picture is from literally a few seconds after and it was also of course surreal i mean i had to check the tags and make sure i was incredulous are you sure this is our child and this was all quite remarkable but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection but nothing like what i feel for him now five years later we have charted our love for our child over time the reason you 're not allowed to chart love is because we think and i think the reality is that love is a process and i think the problem with thinking of love as something that 's binary is that it causes us to to be but i think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early that their in the first few months of all of our children 's lives this is uncle rufus rg i 'm a very affectionate uncle very affectionate uncle av yes and i often joke with rufus when he comes home that i 'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a amongst other babies so i actually threw a pop quiz here onto rufus rg uh oh av i don 't want to embarrass him too much but i am going to give him three seconds rg that is not fair this is a trick question he 's not up there and i want to see if rufus can actually quickly move on to taboo number two you can 't talk about how lonely having a baby can be i enjoyed being pregnant i loved it i felt incredibly connected to the community around me tracking it down till the actual due date i felt like i was a vessel of the future of humanity that continued into the the hospital it was really exhilarating i was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors but when i got home and i was really surprised by those feelings i did expect it to be have sleepless nights constant feedings but i did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that i experienced and i called my sister whom i 'm very close to and had three children and i asked her why didn 't you tell me i was going to be feeling this way that i was going to have these feeling incredibly isolated it 's just not something you want to say to a mother that 's having a baby for the first time rg we think it 's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time and that this of course one of the themes for us is is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is is critical to us collectively being being it 's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation so alisa 's experience is not isolated so your fifty eight percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness of those sixty seven percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five probably really zero to two in the process of preparing this we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this this period of time family members which i think is part of why this is such a tough period so to take one example among many in southern india there 's a practice known as in which the pregnant woman when she 's seven or eight months pregnant moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period av we kind of recalibrated our expectations we thought we actually and then when i was five months we learned that we had lost our child and it was obviously a very difficult time really painful as i was working through that i really wanted to crawl into a hole and i didn 't really know how i was going to work my way back into my surrounding community and i realize i think the way i i was feeling that way is on a really deep gut level i was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed frankly that in some respects i had failed at delivering what i 'm genetically engineered to do and of course it made me question if i wasn 't able to have another child what would that mean for my marriage as i started working through it more and i just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork and i felt like i happened upon this secret society of women that i now was a part of which was reassuring and also really concerning and it 's something women don 't have with miscarriage rg which is too bad fifteen to twenty percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage and i find this astounding in a survey seventy four percent of women said that miscarriage so taboo number four the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family i declan was nine months old and i was sitting there on the couch and i was reading daniel gilbert 's wonderful book stumbling on happiness and i got about two thirds of the way through and there was a chart on the right hand side on the basically there 's this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction which is closely aligned we all know with broader happiness that doesn 't rise again until your first child goes to college so i 'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life this chasm of happiness that we 're driving our proverbial convertible straight into we were despondent av so you can imagine i mean again the first few months were difficult but we 'd come out of it and were really shocked to see this study so we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining rg and that 's when it 's great to be running a website it can 't possibly be that bad so liz mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece and she interviewed four scientists and she also interviewed so this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life average happiness is of course inadequate because it doesn 't speak to the experience and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in and so we all remember as children the tiniest little thing and we see it on the faces of our children the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter and then of course as you get older it 's almost like age is a form of lithium as you get older you and part of what happens i think in your ' 20s and ' 30s is you start to learn to hedge your happiness you start to realize that i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps but it 's more likely that i 'll feel claustrophobic and i won 't be able to get a beer so i 'm not going to go i 've got a good stereo at home so i 'm not going to go so your average happiness goes up but you lose those transcendent moments av yeah and then you have your first child and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows the highs being the first steps the first smile your child reading to you for the first time the lows being our house any time from six to seven every night which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying we trade average happiness we trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for for these transcendent moments we have violated yet another taboo in our own lives and this is a bonus taboo quick bonus taboo for you that we should not be working together especially with three children and we are rg and we had reservations about about this on the front end everybody knows you should absolutely not work with your spouse the venture capitalists said we categorically don 't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives because there 's an extra point of failure it 's a bad idea do it and we obviously went forward we did we raised the money and we 're thrilled that we did because in this phase of one 's life and so the final question that we would ask it 's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy but they 're sometimes pretty quick and so how about that average baseline of happiness can we move that up a little bit av and we kind of feel that the happiness gap which we talked about is really the result of walking into parenting and really any long term partnership for that matter with the wrong expectations and if you have the right expectations and we feel like it 's going to be a pretty gratifying experience rg and so this is what and we think that when you get in there in our case anyway you pack your bags for a trip to europe and you 're really excited to go get out of the airplane it turns out you 're trekking in nepal particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you 're getting in for and you 're psyched so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit"
