  "transcript": "this was in an area called wellawatta a prime residential area in colombo we stood on the railroad tracks that ran between my friend 's house and the beach the tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal i 'd never seen the reef here before there were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water they were trying to catch fish no one realized that this was a very bad idea i turned around to check on my friend 's house then someone on the tracks screamed before i could turn around everyone on the tracks was screaming and running the water had started coming back it was foaming over the reef the children managed to run back onto the tracks no one was lost there but the water continued to climb in about two minutes it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it we had run about one hundred meters by this time it continued to rise i saw an old man and that he would rather die there than run a boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog who was apparently afraid an old lady crying was carried out of her house and up the road by her but they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings for hours afterwards the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around all of this was from the houses in the slum when the waters subsided it was as if it had never existed this may seem hard to believe unless you 've been reading lots and lots of news reports but in many places after the tsunami villagers were still terrified when what was a tranquil sea swallows up people homes and long tail boats mercilessly without warning and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming i 'm not sure you 'd want to calm down either one of the scariest things about the tsunami that i 've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information bigger than the last will be coming at exactly one p m or perhaps tonight or perhaps you don 't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water to catch a boat to the hospital which is more protected we don 't think another wave is coming right away they reported that there was an eight point five magnitude earthquake in sumatra which triggered the massive tsunami having this news was comforting in some small way to understand what had just happened to us however the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now in general everything was merely hearsay and rumor and not a single person i spoke to for over thirty six hours knew anything with any certainty those were two accounts of the asian tsunami from two internet blogs that essentially sprang up now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami that that also were shown on blogs i should warn you they 're pretty powerful one from thailand and the second one from phuket as well it 's coming again new wave first day there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this they said the blogsters let us down the outpouring of information etc who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there and so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment a moment in which the blogosphere came to a certain degree of age now because when we think i think for most of us who are are concerned about them we 're primarily concerned with things like politics technology etc the first one is what does it tell us about our ideas about what motivates people to do things the second is do blogs genuinely have the possibility of of and then the third part is what are the potential problems or the dark side of blogs as we know them ok the first question what do they tell us about why people do things one of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically and of course the internet more generally and it 's going to seem like a very obvious point but i think it is an important one to think about is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content every day and this is at least to a traditional economist somewhat remarkable basically you do things for a concrete reward primarily financial but instead what we 're finding on the internet and one of the great geniuses of it is that people have found a way to work together without any money involved at all they have come up with in a sense a different method for organizing activity and you know if you think about this with the tsunami what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to and it 's one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host activities down the road so i think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money or you have to pay for for it to be good but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands there are a few bloggers somewhere maybe around twenty now who do so howard rheingold has written a lot about this and and i think is writing about this more but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one and one worth thinking about the second collective intelligence you know as chris mentioned i wrote a book called the wisdom of crowds and the premise of the wisdom of crowds is that under the right conditions groups can be remarkably intelligent if you ask a group of people to do something your average guess would be remarkably good it would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of and it would be better than ninety to ninety five percent of you there may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers but for the most part the group 's guess would be better than just about all of you for instance if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information in the gift pack has talked about it as saying that as a writer he 's recognized that his readers know more than he does and it 's a very challenging idea to anyone who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise and who has a lot of but what the blogosphere offers is the and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it each blog post each blog commentary may not in and of itself be exactly what we 're looking for but collectively the judgment of those people posting those people linking more often than not is going to give you a very interesting and enormously valuable picture of of what 's going on that 's the positive side of it that 's the positive side of what is sometimes called participatory etc that in fact we are giving people who have never been able to talk before a but there is a dark side to this and that 's what i want to spend the the last part of my talk on bottom up structure of the internet it is very easy to think that networks are necessarily but there 's also a downside to this a kind of dark side in fact and that is that the more tightly linked we 've become to each other the harder it is for each of us to remain independent one of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that once you are linked in the network the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody that 's one of the things that defines what a network is a network is not just the product of its component parts it is something more than that it is as steven johnson has talked about an emergent phenomenon now this has all these benefits it 's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information it gives you access to but the problem is that groups are only smart when the people in them are as independent as possible or the paradox of collective intelligence that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking that 's very clear in the blogosphere once an idea gets going and so other people in turn link to it etc that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere particularly of the political blogosphere and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful decentralized the metaphor that i like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill the ant colony is the classic metaphor because no individual ant knows what it 's doing but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent and what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle and there 's this famous example of one that was and that i think is a sort of thing to watch out for that 's the thing we have to fear is that we 're just going to keep marching around and around until we die now i want to connect this back though to because one of the great things about the tsunami in terms of the blogosphere 's coverage not in terms of the tsunami itself you saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view in a way that they hadn 't before there you really did see the intelligence of the web manifest itself so that 's the upside the circular mill is the downside and i think that the former is what we really need to strive for"
