  "transcript": "is the large hadron collider it 's twenty seven kilometers in circumference it 's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted over ten thousand physicists and engineers from countries around the world have come together hydrogen nuclei around ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine percent the speed of light right at that speed they go around that twenty seven kilometers and we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite you get some sense of the size you can just see these people underneath and we re create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to six hundred million times a second inside that detector immense numbers and if you see those so it can measure how fast they 're traveling this is a picture about a year ago those magnets are in there and again and it 's in so as of today it 's finished i 'd like to say that i planned that but i didn 't so it 's been completed as of today yeah it 's a wonderful achievement so you might be asking why why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious and the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything 's made of and how everything sticks together and by everything i mean of course me and you the earth the sun the one hundred billion suns in our galaxy and the one hundred billion galaxies in the observable but why not just look at it you know if you want to know what i 'm made of let 's look at me we found that as you look back in time the universe gets hotter and hotter denser and denser and simpler and simpler we believe it was just made of stuck together by four forces of nature the electron the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus held around in orbit by the way by the electromagnetic force that 's carried by this thing the photon the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons and these guys here they 're the weak nuclear force probably the least familiar but without it the sun wouldn 't shine and when the sun shines you get copious quantities of these things called if you just look at your thumbnail because the weak force is correctly named very short range and very weak so they just fly through you and these particles have been discovered over the last and the last one this thing called the tau neutrino in the year two thousand actually just i was going to say just up the road in chicago i know it 's a big country america isn 't it relative to the universe it 's just up the road laughter so this thing was discovered in the year two thousand so it 's a relatively recent picture one of the wonderful things actually i find is that we 've any of them when you realize how tiny they are you know they 're a one hundred billion galaxies thirteen point seven billion light years away absolutely exquisitely minute and yet we 've discovered pretty much the full set one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ernest rutherford discoverer of the atomic nucleus once said all science is either physics or stamp collecting now i don 't think he meant to insult so it 's possible laughter ok we 've discovered the but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern you know why it 's built the way it is really you 've done stamp collecting you haven 't done science fortunately we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern it 's the newton 's laws if you want of particle physics it 's called the standard model beautifully simple mathematical equation you could stick it on the front is always the sign of elegance this is it i 've been a little disingenuous because i 've expanded it out in all its gory detail so you want to know why the sky is blue why atomic nuclei stick together in principle you 've got but there 's a problem can anyone see what it is a bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me i 'll basically but there 's an extra h stands for higgs particle higgs particles have not been discovered they 're necessary to make that mathematics work so all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn 't be possible without an extra bit so it 's a prediction a prediction of a new particle time to come up with good analogies and back in the 1980s when we wanted the money for the lhc from the u k government i want to know what this higgs particle does and we came up with this analogy and it seemed to work well what the higgs does is it gives mass to the fundamental particles and the picture is that the whole universe and that doesn 't mean just space it means me as well and inside you the whole universe is full of something called a higgs field higgs particles if you will the analogy is that these people in a room are they 're massless and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room and that 's exactly the way the higgs mechanism works the picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us because they 're surrounded by higgs i 'm glad you recognize margaret thatcher actually i thought about making it more culturally relevant so that 's one thing that 's essentially a guarantee of what the lhc will find dark energy the three but they just miss now there 's a theory called super symmetry which doubles the number of particles in the standard model which at first sight doesn 't sound like a simplification but actually with this theory we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together back at the big bang so a very compelling theory that 's really mainstream physics and if i was to put money on it i would put money on in a very unscientific way that that these things would also crop up at the lhc many other things that the lhc could discover but in the last few minutes i just want to give you a and that 's that i think it 's given us a wonderful from modern science over the last few decades and i 'd say that it deserves in the spirit of wade davis ' talk to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation of the high andes and the frozen north this is a creation story i think equally as wonderful the story goes like this we know that the universe began thirteen point seven billion years ago in an immensely hot dense state it began to expand about a million billion billion billion billionth of a second i think i got that right after the big bang gravity separated away from the other forces the universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation in about the first billionth of a second or so the higgs field kicked in and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass the universe continued to expand and cool after about a few minutes there was hydrogen and helium in the universe that 's all the universe was about it continued to expand and that 's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that george smoot described as looking at the face of god and that hydrogen that then began to cook into the heavier elements so the elements of life carbon and oxygen and iron all the elements that we need to make us up were cooked in they then re collapsed into another generation of stars on the surface on at least one and eventually and you can see the civilization from space as one of my great heroes carl sagan said these are the things and actually not only these but i was looking around these are the things like and the laws of physics and i think that 's a it makes me really feel that that civilization which as i say if you believe the scientific creation story it makes me feel incredibly valuable so that 's the lhc the lhc is certainly and i 'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on thanks"
