  "transcript": "i am a palliative care physician and i would like to talk to you today about health care i 'd like to talk to you about the health and care of the most vulnerable population our country those people dealing with the most complex serious health and the intersection of these two should scare the hell out of you i 'd also like to talk to you about palliative medicine grounded in what they value patient centric care based on their values it 's a care model that tells the truth and engages one on one and meets people where they 're at i 'd like to start by telling the story of my very first patient it was my first day as a physician the long white coat i stumbled into the hospital and right away there 's a gentleman harold sixty eight years old came to the emergency department he had had headaches for about six weeks that got worse and worse and worse and worse and worse evaluation revealed he had cancer that had spread to his brain the attending physician directed me to go share with harold and his family the the prognosis and options of care i did the only thing i knew how took harold 's hand took his wife 's hand and just breathed harold went fishing the next day he died a week later as i 've gone through my training in my career i think back to harold and i think that this is a conversation and it 's a conversation that had led us to crisis so what do we know we know that this population the most ill takes up fifteen percent of the gross domestic product nearly two point three trillion dollars if we extrapolate this out over the next two decades with the growth of baby boomers at this rate it is sixty percent of the gdp sixty percent of the gross domestic product of the united states of america it has very little to do it has to do with every thing that we value and every thing that we know it has at stake the free market economy and capitalism of the united states of america let 's forget all the statistics for a minute forget the numbers about the value we get for all these dollars we spend well the dartmouth atlas about six years ago looked at every dollar spent by medicare generally this population we found that those patients who have the highest per capita expenditures had the highest suffering pain more often than not they die sooner how can this be we live in the united states it has the greatest health care system on the planet we spend ten times more on these patients than the second leading country in the world that doesn 't make sense but what we know is out of the top fifty countries on the planet with something i experience every day in my practice and i 'm sure something many of you on your own journeys have experienced more is not more those individuals who had more tests more bells more whistles more chemotherapy more surgery more whatever the more that we do to someone and it shortens it most often so what and why is this so the grim reality ladies and gentlemen is that we the health care industry long white coat physicians are stealing from you stealing from you the opportunity how can we treat this without understanding this we need to do things for this the triple aim of healthcare one improve patient experience two improve the population decrease per capita expenditure across a continuum working with the sickest of the sick dementia how did we improve patient experience i want to be at home doc ok we 'll bring the care to you enhanced think about the human being two population health how did we look at this population differently and engage with them at a different level a deeper level and connect to a broader sense of the human condition than my own how do we manage so that of in two thousand and twelve never had to go to the hospital not because they couldn 't but they didn 't have to we brought the care to them we maintained their value their quality number three per capita expenditures for this population that today is two point three trillion dollars and in twenty years is sixty percent of the gdp we reduced health care expenditures by nearly seventy percent they got more of what they wanted based on their values lived better and are living longer for two thirds less money while harold 's time was limited palliative care 's is not palliative care is a paradigm from diagnosis through the end of life the hours weeks months years spread throughout her body 50s and she is living this is not about end of life this is about life this is not just about the elderly this is about people this is richard end stage lung disease richard what is it that you hold sacred and and then we just i listened and tried to hear big difference use these in proportion to this i said alright let 's take it one day at a time like we do in every other chapter of our life and we have met richard where richard 's but he 's thriving in the context of end stage lung disease now palliative medicine is not just for the elderly it is not just for the middle aged it meet my friend jonathan we have the honor and pleasure of jonathan and his father joining us here today jonathan is in his 20s and i met him several years ago he was dealing with metastatic testicular cancer upon meeting him and his family he was a couple of weeks away from a bone marrow transplant and in listening and engaging they said help us understand what is how did we get this far without understanding what we 're dealing with how did we get this far without empowering somebody to know what it is they 're dealing with and then taking the next step and engaging in who they are as human beings to know if that is what we should do lord knows we can do any kind of thing to you but should we don 't take my word for it all the evidence that is related to palliative care these days demonstrates with absolute certainty people live better and live longer there was a seminal article out of the new england journal of medicine in two thousand and ten a one group with similar group without they lived if palliative care were a cancer drug every cancer doctor on the planet would write a prescription for it don 't they again because we goofy long white coat physicians are trained and of the mantra of dealing with this not with this but this conversation today is not about dying it is about living living based on our values what we find sacred and how we want to write the chapters of our lives whether it 's the last what we know what we have proven is that this conversation needs to happen today not next week not next year what is at stake is our lives today and the lives of us as we get older and the lives of our children and our grandchildren but everywhere we go and everything we see and change it for the better to my patients i ask that we stand and we shout and we demand the best care possible so that we can live better today and ensure a better life tomorrow we need to shift today thank you very much"
