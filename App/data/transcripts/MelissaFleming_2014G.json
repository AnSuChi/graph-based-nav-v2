  "transcript": "i started working with refugees because i wanted to make a difference and making a difference starts with telling their stories i always ask them did the rest of your family make it out alive how are you coping but there 's one question that always seems to me to be most revealing and that is what did you take what was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town a syrian refugee boy i know told me that he didn 't hesitate when his life was in imminent danger he said i took my high school diploma because my life depended on it and he would risk his life to get that diploma on his way to school he would dodge snipers his classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling please don 't go to school ' and when he insisted she said i would hug him as if it were for the last time but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear the family got terrible news hany 's aunt his uncle and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house their throats it was time to flee but they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony they joined in a country lebanon that is tiny and there are one million syrian refugees living there there 's not a town a city or a village that is not host to syrian refugees this is generosity and humanity that is remarkable think about it this way proportionately it would be as if eighty million people would flee to the united states in just three years half of the entire population of syria is now uprooted most of them inside the country six and a half million people have fled for their lives over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries and only a small proportion as you see have moved on what i find most worrying is that half of all syrian refugees are children i took this picture of this little girl it was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from syria and most troubling of all is that only twenty percent of syrian refugee children are in school and yet syrian refugee children all refugee children tell us education is the most important thing in their lives and i thought she 's beautiful and i went up to her and asked her can i take your picture and she said yes i think she couldn 't because i think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of syrian refugee children a generation isolated and yet 's home was also destroyed this will need to be rebuilt communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge shouldn 't this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake the societies in exile the refugees refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return you might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state and we conducted our entire conversation in which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of dan brown 's novels and from listening to american rap i am nothing hany is one of fifty million people never since world war ii have so many people been forcibly displaced so while we 're making sweeping progress in human education and design we are doing dangerously little to help the victims and there are more and more victims on average by the end of this day thirty two thousand people will be forcibly displaced from their homes thirty two thousand people they flee across borders like this one we captured this on the syrian border to jordan and this is a typical risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in europe this syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized most of the people drowned and he told us syrians are just looking for a quiet place where nobody hurts you where nobody humiliates you and where nobody kills you well i think that should be the minimum and even opportunity americans and europeans have the impression that proportionally huge but the reality is that eighty six percent the vast majority of refugees are living in the developing world in countries struggling with their own insecurity so wealthy countries in the world should recognize recognize and all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border we can help them thrive we should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end rather as centers of excellence where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation but i 'm reminded of the terrible war in somalia that has been raging on for twenty two years i visited this camp it 's in djibouti neighboring somalia and it was so remote and we went to visit a school and started talking to the children and then i saw this girl across the room who looked to me and i went up and talked to her like what is your favorite subject and what do you want to be when you grow up and she said to me i have no future my schooling days are over and i thought there must be some misunderstanding so i turned to my colleague and she confirmed to me and how i wished at that moment that i could say to her we will build you a school she should be and she is the future of somalia atem he watched this is in sudan as his village he was only seven years old burned to the ground and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family only his cousin survived and the two of them walked for seven months this is boys like him and he would spend the next seven years but his life changed and he found love in a foster family and he was able to go to school and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university i spoke to him on skype the other day and he was in his new university in florida pursuing his and he proudly told me how he was able to raise enough funds from the american public to establish a health clinic back in his village back home so i want to take you back to hany when i told him i was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the ted stage he allowed me to read you a poem that he sent in an email to me he wrote birds and tea in the morning oh oh i had so many dreams that were about to be realized so here is my point not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity and they risk and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries i believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world the victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace and it 's the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence we would love to help him go to university and to become food rations and a bit of medicine and he will become a member of a lost thank you"
