  "transcript": "i want to open by quoting einstein 's wonderful statement just so people will feel at ease he said a human being is a part of the whole called by us a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty wherein compassion karuna it is called is defined as the sensitivity to another 's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering it pairs closely which requires of course that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it this is perfect in that it clearly opposes the concern for others and further it indicates that those caught in the cycle of while the compassionate the dalai lama often states that compassion is his best friend it helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair most terrible suffering even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings and he begins to move beyond his self concern into the broader concern for others and this immediately cheers him up as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion he uses his own suffering he is a very good colleague of einstein 's we must say now i want to tell a story which is a very famous story in the indian and buddhist tradition of the great saint asanga who was a contemporary of augustine in the west and was sort of like the buddhist augustine and asanga lived eight hundred years after the buddha 's time and he was discontented with the state of people 's practice of the buddhist religion in india at that time buddha 's teaching has lost its momentum i know the next buddha will come a few thousand years from now but exists currently in a certain that 's maitreya and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today so he went on this retreat and as he was leaving he saw a man a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain and and he became interested in that he said well what are you doing and the man said i 'm making a needle and he said that 's ridiculous you can 't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth and the man said really and he showed him a dish full of needles so he said he leaves again and where it 's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff its feathers brushes the rock and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in there was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds again no vision of maitreya after nine years and he again leaves and this time water dripping making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips and he 's freaked out and he won 't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision and he comes to a broken person and there in the town he 's approached by a dog who comes and he becomes interested in this dog because it 's so pathetic and it 's trying to attract his attention and he sits down looking at the dog and the dog 's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore some of it is like gangrenous and there terrible he thinks what can i do to fix up this dog well at least i can clean this wound and wash it so he takes it to some water he 's about to clean but then his awareness focuses on the maggots and he sees the maggots and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute and they 're maggoting happily in the dog 's hindquarters there well if i clean the dog i 'll kill he was not really thinking too carefully about the aspca he was just immediately caught with the situation and then i 'll figure out what to do with the maggots so he starts to do that he can 't grab the maggots apparently they wriggle around they 're kind of hard to grab these maggots so he says well i 'll put my tongue and then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue the dog is kind of used up and then i 'll spit them one by one so he goes down and he 's sticking his tongue out like this and and then suddenly there 's a pfft a noise like that he jumps back and there of course is the future buddha maitreya and he so as he comes up from his first bow he says my lord i 'm so happy to see you but where have you been for twelve years what is this and maitreya says i was with you who do you think was making needles mister dense and so he looked very dubious asanga did and he said if you don 't believe me just take me with you and so he took the maitreya it shrunk into a globe a ball took him on his shoulder the future buddha has come ahead of all predictions here he is and then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him it wasn 't chautauqua it was some other town shouting that but on the edge of town one elderly lady charwoman in the charnel ground saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog but she saw the jewel foot of the maitreya and she offered a flower so that encouraged him and he went with maitreya maitreya then took him to a certain heaven which is the typical way a buddhist myth unfolds and maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion and then i thought i would share with you what that method is or one of them a famous one it 's called the sevenfold causal method of developing compassion and it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one the humans are human and parents and children can fight so in a way i like them so much because they 're nice to me they could all be just fine fine i could be them and then the buddhists of course think that because we 've all had infinite previous lives actually therefore all of you in the buddhist view in some previous life although you don 't remember it and neither do i have been my mother for which i do apologize for the trouble i caused you and also actually i 've been your mother that 's wonderful so a theist christian can think that all beings even my enemies are god 's children so in that sense we 're related so we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love just in the meditation and we definitely reduce the hostility and the i don 't want to be compassionate to them to the ones we think of as the bad guys the ones we hate and we don 't like and we don 't hate anyone therefore so we equalize that 's very important and then the next thing we do is what is called mother recognition and that is we expand we take the feeling about remembering a mama and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation and we see the mother in every being we see that look that the mother has on her face being a mammal the mother is the model of all altruism for for human beings and so we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings people laugh at me because you know i used to say that i used to meditate on mama cheney i used to meditate on george bush he 's quite a cute mom in a female form he has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms and you think of him as nursing you and then saddam hussein 's serious mustache is a problem but and you do that for a while until you really feel that you can feel the familiarity of all beings nobody seems alien they 're not then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general if you can remember the kindness of your own mother if you can remember the kindness of your spouse or if you are a mother yourself how you were with your and then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy when they are satisfied and every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness and you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy even the enemy we think jesus is being unrealistic when he says love thine enemy he does say that and we think he 's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin nice for him to say it but i can 't do that why would they bother to be your enemy how boring to run so it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy because they 'll stop being your enemy because that 's too much trouble the fifth step is compassion universal compassion most of the time you see that furrowed brow in people they 're driven by this duty and this obligation i have to get that i need more i 'm not worthy and i should do something and they 're rushing around all stressed out hopefully will be more practical than poor asanga because he had that motivation and whoever was in front of him he wanted to help but of course that is impractical he should have founded the aspca in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots and i 'm sure he did that later laughter but that just indicates the state of mind you know and so the next step the sixth step beyond universal compassion and you have compassion for yourself also and you might be in fear of something some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future and so they get reborn as whatever what is called universal responsibility we are responsible for and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it we absolutely must do that there is no way not to do it and then finally that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy one thing we mustn 't think is that compassion and it helps them already and gives them an example so read the charter disseminate it and develop it within yourself don 't just think well i 'm compassionate or i 'm not compassionate and sort of think you 're stuck there you can develop the callousness the neglect of others and take universal responsibility for them"
