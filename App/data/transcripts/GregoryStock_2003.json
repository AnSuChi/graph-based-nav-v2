  "transcript": "the future of life where the unraveling of our biology and bring up the lights a little bit i don 't have any slides i 'm just going to talk i all the visions of the first couple of sessions it almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future it and yet i don 't really think it is because when it comes down to it it 's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain what people in the future are going to remember about this period i want to talk to you a little bit about why the visions of jeremy rivkins who would like to ban these sorts of technologies or of the bill joys who would like to relinquish them are actually to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us the biological sciences the reason i 'm doing that is because those are going to be the areas that are the most significant to us the reason for that is and what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future and that of our children and that of their children whether we gain control over aging whether we learn to protect ourselves from alzheimer 's and heart disease and cancer i think that shakespeare really put and i 'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did he said and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale and we need to think about planning a little and you know i 'm getting a little bit gray so is ray kurzweil so is eric drexler it wasn 't two years ago that everybody was talking about we 're deciphering the code of codes we 're reading the book of life it 's a little bit reminiscent of one and we 're still picking up pieces of the challenger so it 's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe thirty or forty years from now we 'll look back at this instant in time and all of the sort of talk about the human genome project and what all this is going to mean to us well it will and i just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case because when we talk about our genetics and our biology and modifying and altering and adjusting these things we 're talking about changing ourselves and this is very critical stuff what 's happening is we 're taking this technology it 's becoming more precise more potent and we 're turning it back upon ourselves before it 's all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed it 's going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine on the way there it 's going to it 's going to change the way we manage and alter our emotions it 's going to probably change the human lifespan it will really make us question what it is to be a human being the larger context of this is that are two unprecedented which you all are very very familiar with it 's changing our lives in so many ways and it will continue to do that what the essence of and we 're breathing a level of complexity into it that rivals that of life itself and may even surpass it the genomics revolution proteomics metabolomics all of these omics that sound so terrific on grants and on business the most immediate changes that we 'll see are things like in medicine there is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine as we start to be able to identify but who is going to pay for all this and how are we going to understand all this complex information that is going to be the it challenge of the next generation is communicating all this information there 's pharmacogenomics the combination of pharmacology and tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions that but it 's going to have a big impact because we 're going to have niche drugs and it 's too risk averse and it is really not suited for the future that we 're moving into another thing is that we 're just going to have to deal with this knowledge it 's really wonderful when we hear ninety nine point nine percent of the letters in the code are the same we 're all identical to each other isn 't it and look around you and know that what we really care about but not to each other because we compete with each other all time and we 're going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about and between subpopulations of humans as well to deny that that 's the case is not a very good start on that a generation or so away there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen that 's when we 're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves now i don 't mean extra gills or something something we care about like aging what if we could and it 's obvious to anyone that if we can do this we absolutely will do this whatever the consequences are the second is viagra things of that sort prozac you know this is just clumsy little baby steps what if you could take a little concoction of pharmaceuticals that would make you feel really contented just happy to be you are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn 't have any overt side effects we 're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior it 's going to be very challenging to deal with the idea that we 're going to chose our children 's genes as we begin to understand what genes the birth of a delayed identical twin is not embryo screening you take a six to eight cell embryo you tease out one of the cells you run a genetic test on that cell and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard and pretty soon it 's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way as that becomes possible this is going to move from something that is used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization to the wealthy who want to protect their children to just about everybody else and in that process that 's going to morph from being just for diseases to being for lesser vulnerabilities like risk of manic depression or something to picking temperaments traits these sorts of things of course there is going to be genetic engineering directly going in it 's a little bit further away but not that far away going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo the way i suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes so we go from forty six to forty seven or forty eight and one that is not heritable because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic it 's a joke of course they wouldn 't want to do that they 'll want the new release those kinds of loose analogies with and with programming are actually much deeper than that and when they 're almost impossible it 's when and where and how it 's going to happen it is being funded very very the second is we try and use our technology to improve our lives in one way or another to imagine that we 're not going to use these technologies when they become available and they already are between therapy and enhancement that 's really the the central one i believe people can try and ban these things they undoubtedly will they have but ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development it 's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy because they are in the best position to circumvent any of these and it 's going to deny us the information that we need to make wise decisions about how to use these technologies but we shouldn 't kid ourselves and think that we 're going to reach a consensus about these things that is simply not going to happen and they depend too much upon history upon philosophy upon religion upon culture upon politics some people are going to see this as an abomination as the worst thing as just awful other people are going to say this is great this is the flowering of human endeavor the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies is that it and to focus too much on all the high technology possibilities that exist and to lose touch with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health save them from overeating from eating a lot of fast foods from not getting any exercise it 's not going to happen it 's really interesting because there is sort of a counter revolution that is going on a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past in nutraceuticals in all of these sorts of things that some people in the pharmaceutical industry particularly like to brand as is driven by it as well because that is how we 're gathering all this information and linking it and integrating it together there is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well and that 's where about half of our drugs come so we shouldn 't dismiss this because it 's an enormous opportunity to use these sorts of results or these random loose trials from the last thousand years about and to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise basically in fact this isn 't just abstract i just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for alzheimer 's and other diseases of aging and we 're making some real progress so here we are it 's the beginning of a new millennium i mean future humans far before the end of this millennium in a few hundred years they are going to look back at this moment and i don 't think that 's what 's going to happen and they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time they are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives of their society of their future you know it 's a little bit like a birth where there is this bloody and we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there so to me it 's clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology going to come gradually at first it 's going to pick up speed we 're going to make lots of errors that 's the way these things work to me it 's an incredible privilege to be alive now and to be to be able to witness this thing it is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life it i think that we should be proud of it it 's our future it 's our children i think that our choice in the choice of life is not whether we 're going to go down this path we are definitely it 's how we hold it i think thucydides really spoke to us very clearly in four hundred and thirty b c he put it nicely again i 'll use the words in the same order he did the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision they go out and they meet it"
