  "transcript": "let 's start with a story about this culture that lived in micronesia in the early called the yap now i want to tell you about the yap now the yap don 't actually move these rai stones around or exchange there 's a story about these sailors that were transporting a stone across the ocean when they ran into some trouble and the stone actually fell in the sailors had the stone and why not it still counted even though it was at the bottom of the ocean it was still part of the yap economy you might think that this was just a small culture and the yap actually still use a form of these stones so instead someone went to where that gold was being stored and they just labeled it as belonging to france now the point i want to make with these two examples is that the only reason these things and because we 've decided that they do money is about the exchanges and the transactions that we have with each other it 's about a collective story that we tell each other about value a collective fiction and that 's a really powerful concept in the past two decades we 've begun to use digital money so i get paid via direct deposit i pay my rent via bank transfer i pay my taxes online and every month a small amount of money is deducted from my paycheck and invested in mutual funds in my retirement account there 's not even anything physical like a stone or a coin it 's because there are large institutions underwriting every one or zero that changes on a computer and when it doesn 't it 's often the fault of those large it 's up to them to fix the problem and a lot of times they don 't there 's a lot of friction in the system half my credit cards still don 't work in europe that 's friction transferring money across borders and across currencies is really expensive friction but it 's hard for her to get loans and to get paid friction our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact is being held captive by these gatekeepers and there 's a lot of impediments in the system slowing things down and these companies have the right to say no if i 'm a paypal merchant and paypal wrongly flags me for fraud that 's it my account gets frozen i can 't get paid instagram they 're on all these different websites they don 't inter operate and as a result my photo library is a mess the same thing happens when institutions control the money supply a lot of these services and it makes transaction costs go up so far we 've been through two phases of money in an analog world we had to deal with these physical objects and money moved at a certain speed the speed of humans in a digital world money can reach much farther at the mercy of these gatekeeper institutions money only moves at the speed of banks we the future of money is programmable when we combine software and currency and we don 't have to rely on institutions for security in a programmable world we and when this happens we won 't even feel like we 're transacting anymore money will be directed by software and it will just safely and securely flow are the first step of this evolution it 's money designed to work in a world without intermediaries bitcoin is the most ubiquitous but there are hundreds of them there 's the sushi restaurant down my street takes bitcoin i have an app on my phone that but it 's not just for small transactions in march there was a transaction that moved around one hundred thousand bitcoins that 's the equivalent of forty million us dollars are based on a special field of mathematics called cryptography cryptography underpins so many of the systems around us and it 's so powerful that at times the us government has actually classified it as a was critical to decoding enemy transmissions and turning the tide of the war anyone with a modern web browser is running a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem it 's what we use to secure our interactions on the internet it 's what makes it safe for us to type our passwords in and to send financial information to websites so what the banks used to give us and this means that we don 't have to rely on the banks anymore to secure our transactions we can do it ourselves bitcoin is based on the very same idea that the yap used this collective global knowledge of transfers imagine that we had this magic paper so the way that this paper works is i can give you a sheet of it and if you write something on it it will magically appear on my piece as well let 's say we just give everyone this paper and everyone writes down the transfers that they 're doing in the bitcoin system all of these transfers get copied around to everyone else 's pieces of paper and i can look at mine and i 'll have a list of all of the transfers that are happening in the entire bitcoin economy this is actually what 's happening with the bitcoin blockchain which is a list of all of the transactions in bitcoin it 's done through computer code running on thousands of networked computers around the world all of these computers are collectively confirming who owns what bitcoin so the bitcoin blockchain is core to how bitcoin works but where do bitcoins the code is designed to create new bitcoin according to a schedule and the way that it works is that to get those bitcoin i have to solve a puzzle imagine that we had fifteen dice and we were throwing these dice over and over again we say that we win this is very close to what these computers are all we say that they 've solved the puzzle the computer that solves the puzzle and in the act of solving these computers are actually helping to secure the bitcoin blockchain and add to the list of transactions anyone can become a bitcoin miner you can go download the software right now and run it in your computer and try to collect some the bitcoin network and all of this special hardware there are estimates that the amount of energy it uses equivalent to that of a small country cryptocurrencies are a little bit slow and a little bit cumbersome but the next generation is going to be so much better and so much faster the first step to a world with a global programmable money and in a world with programmable money i can pay anyone else securely and i can send money around the world this is a really amazing thing because it was built upon an open architecture and just like the internet changed the way we communicate imagine a world where i can rent out my healthcare data to a pharmaceutical company they can run large scale data analysis and provide me with a cryptographic proof that shows they 're only using my data in a way that we agreed and they can pay me for what they find out instead of signing up for streaming services and getting a cable bill what if my television analyzed my watching habits and recommended well priced content that fit within my budget that i would enjoy we just pay interestingly things like micro payments are actually going to change the way security works in our world because once we 're better able to allocate value people will use their money and their energies for more constructive things if it cost a fraction of a cent to send an email would we still have spam we it 's like we 're in a world that is seeing the first automobile the first like the first car like the horse and carriage works pretty well whole world economy is built on it if you were the first person on your block to get a car with an internal combustion engine your neighbors would probably think you were crazy why would you want this large clunky machine that breaks down all the time that lights on fire and is still slower than a horse but we all know how that story turns out we 're entering a new era of programmable money and it 's very exciting but it 's also a little bit scary cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal transactions just like cash is used for crime in the world today when all of our transactions are online what does that mean for surveillance who can see what we do who 's advantaged in this new world and who isn 't i have to start to pay for things that i didn 't have to pay for before will we all become slaves to algorithms and utility functions all new technology comes with trade offs but it also greatly increased productivity mobile phones are annoying because they make me feel like i have to stay connected to work but it 's also going to create new flexible forms of employment trusted institutions from the architecture of the network and this pushes innovation in money out to the edges where it belongs programmable money democratizes money thank you"
