  "transcript": "i 've been researching the way and i 've noticed an interesting shift we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us also known as the great chain of being or scala naturae in latin noblemen common people animals and so on which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories like the ones you see behind me this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the porphyrian tree also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge the branching scheme of the tree was in fact such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became over time an important communication tool to map we can also see trees being used to map genealogy perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram i think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way and finally of course also a very popular scientific metaphor we can see trees being used to map all species known to man and trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways they really embody this human desire for order for balance for unity for symmetry however nowadays we are really facing new complex intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree and it 's currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge and this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network we can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain this is a beautiful snapshot created by the blue brain project where we can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge these are some remarkable trees of knowledge or trees of science by spanish scholar ramon llull when we say biology is a branch of science when we say genetics is a branch of science but perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge at least for me was created for the french encyclopedia by and it actually all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree but knowledge is much more intricate than this and i think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of wikipedia arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man we can we can also see this interesting shift this is the typical organization chart i 'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well in your own corporations or others but humans sometimes are well actually all humans are unique in their own way and sometimes you really don 't play well under this really rigid structure i this is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between perl developers perl is a famous it 's a network we can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism one of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays is that we are dealing with decentralized independent cells where there 's no leader leading the whole process and here you can actually see how visualization is being used the diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the madrid attack in two thousand and four represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me and the blue lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year we can also see this shift from trees into networks in the way we classify and organize species the image on the right is the only illustration that darwin included in the origin of species which darwin called the tree of life but recently scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria and are actually tying together species that were completely separated before to what scientists are now calling but the web of life the network of life again when we look at ecosystems around our planet no more do we have these simplified predator versus prey diagrams we have all learned at school mapping close to one hundred species that interact with the codfish off the coast of newfoundland in canada and but even though and here is an example at the top left the very first project is a gene network followed by a network of ip addresses machines servers followed by a network of facebook friends you probably couldn 't find more disparate topics yet they are using the same metaphor the same visual model to map the but networks are not just a scientific metaphor as designers researchers and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields like painting and sculpture and influencing many different artists and perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them they 're immensely gorgeous which i 've called networkism and we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways this is just one of many you have transient structures and unstable networks and here 's another example of that interesting using only graphite on paper and she creates these striking imaginary landscapes where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization and i think the title really says it all it 's called galaxies forming along filaments like droplets along the strands of a spider 's web and i just find this particular project to be immensely powerful it was created and he occupies these large spaces creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes as you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes the entire network kind of shifts this was created by japanese artist sometimes even including people in many of her installations and it 's too easy for us to dismiss it as such and this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays from decoding the human brain to understanding the vast universe out there and on your right side you have the millennium simulation it was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure it was able to recreate and coincidentally or not i just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge the brain and the largest scale of knowledge the universe itself to be really really quite striking and fascinating because as bruce mau once said when everything is connected to everything else for better or for worse everything matters thank you so much"
