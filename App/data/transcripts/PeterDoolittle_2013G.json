  "transcript": "and we 're moving when the person in front of me slows down and well that wasn 't fast enough for me and he was doing this now we could approach this from a working memory now working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are if you turn it off that 's called a coma now working memory has four basic components processes it now the current goal isn 't something like i want to be president or the best surfer in the world it 's more mundane i 'd like that cookie now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal and it 's associated with a lot of positive effects people with high working memory capacity they tend to solve and do well standardized tests they 're also able to reason at high levels so what we 're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that so i 'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks and we 're going to take your working memory out for a ride you up for i want to see what happens with those words so here 's the words so good okay what i want you to do is i want you to tell me what the answer is to twenty three times eight just shout it out it 's a neurological test just in case you were wondering all right now what i want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the english alphabet backwards you should have started with z how many people here are still pretty sure you 've got all five words up with about less than half right which is normal there will be a range some people can hang on to five some people can hang on to ten some will be down to two or three what we know is this is really important to the way we function right now the problem that we have is that life comes at us and it comes at us very quickly and what we need to do is to take that amorphous now don 't get me wrong working memory is awesome working memory allows us to it allows us to make sense of the world around us now and i can build a narrative around that so i know where we 've been and where we 're going and how to contribute to this conversation it allows us to problem solve critical think decide whether or not we like it ask follow up questions all of that occurs it also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we 're really looking for is red bull and bacon gotta make sure we 're getting what we 're looking for now we tend to remember about we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us have you ever walked from one room to another and then forgotten why you 're there you go back to that original room have you ever forgotten your keys you ever forgotten your car you ever forgotten your kids have you and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting until you hear that last word go up and you realize you 've been asked a question all of that talks about working memory what we can do and what we can 't do we need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that we negotiate that through strategies so what i want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here and these will be really important because you are now in an information target rich environment for the next several days now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence our life immediately and repeatedly we need to process what 's going on the moment it happens not ten minutes later not a week later so we need to think about well do i agree with him what 's missing what would i like to know how can i apply this in my life so we need to think about it here in between pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time practice for some reason became a very negative thing it 's very positive the next thing is we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively oftentimes we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge what we want to do is spin that around we want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful we need to take advantage of that think about things in images write things down that way pull things up i just got through reading the great gatsby and i have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head so my own version the last one so we need to structure what we 're doing in ways that make sense if we are providing knowledge and experience we need to structure that and the last one is support we all started as novices everything we do is an approximation of sophistication we should expect it to change over time we have to support that the support may come in asking people questions giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some now the final piece of this the take home message if we 're not processing life"
