  "transcript": "so i was privileged to train in transplantation thomas starzl who performed the world 's first successful liver transplant i returned to singapore and in one thousand nine hundred and ninety performed asia 's first successful cadaveric now when i look back the transplant was actually the easiest part but perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators a matter which was debated in the parliament but twenty years on asia 's longest surviving cadaveric liver transplant to date i am the proud godmother to her fourteen year old son but not all patients on the transplant wait list are the truth is there are just simply not enough donor organs to go around as the demand for donor organs continues to rise in large part due to the aging population the supply has remained relatively constant in the united states alone one hundred thousand men women and children are on the waiting list for donor organs and more than a dozen die each the transplant community has actively campaigned in organ donation and the gift of life has been extended related donors relatives who might donate an organ and this then has given rise to unprecedented and unexpected moral controversy how can one distinguish a donation that is voluntary and altruistic from one that is forced or coerced from for example a submissive spouse and in some areas the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward and that was i was also but my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts thoughts of walking through the i would feel driving to the ready to receive remove the organs and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life the consent had been obtained my life the one fulfilling skill that i had was now invoking feelings of conflict conflict ranging from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience but really none of us remained the same i was troubled that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners was at least as morally controversial as the harvesting of stem cells from human embryos i realized as a surgical pioneer that the purpose of my position of influence was surely to speak up for those who have no influence it made me wonder if there could be a better way a way to circumvent death and yet deliver the gift of life that might exponentially impact millions of patients worldwide the practice of surgery evolved from big to small and in transplantation and this inspired in my mind a shift why not take the individual cells technically a much simpler procedure than having to grapple with the complexities of transplanting stem cell research had gained momentum following the isolation of the world 's first human embryonic stem cells in the pancreatic islet cells captured the attention of the media and the imagination of the and i focused my research embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage chiefly because of their pluripotency that is but the moral controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells the fact that these cells are old human embryos i inspired my lab to focus on what i thought was the most adipose tissue or fat yes fat nowadays available in abundant supply you and i i think would be very happy and adult stem cells are found in you and me in our fat our skin and other organs but adult stem cells are not and here is the limitation adult stem cells are mature cells and like mature human beings these cells are more restricted in their thought and more restricted in their behavior and are unable to give rise to the wide variety of specialized cell they discovered could be reprogrammed and so guess what scientists around the world and in the labs are racing to convert aging adult cells aging adult cells from you and me they are racing to reprogram these in our lab we are focused on taking fat and reprogramming mounds of fat into fountains of youthful cells which one day may be used as if this research is successful it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions heart disease stroke spinal cord injury muscular dystrophy retinal eye diseases of these conditions something horrible happened to me but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room i realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness high altitude sun exposure what happened to me might have been catastrophic if not for the fact and i had my vision restored but not before a prolonged period of convalescence three months in a head down position this experience taught me to empathize more with my patients and especially those with retinal diseases thirty seven million people worldwide are blind and one hundred and twenty seven million more suffer from impaired vision stem now in a research phase indeed we live in both challenging as well as exciting times as the world population ages scientists are racing to discover new ways it is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation and these stem cells then float in the bloodstream and hone in to damaged organs to release growth factors to repair the damaged tissue stem cells may be used as building blocks to repair damaged scaffolds within our body or to provide new liver cells to repair damaged liver as we speak there are one hundred and seventeen or so clinical trials researching the use of stem cells for liver diseases what lies ahead heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide one point one million americans suffer heart attacks yearly four point eight million suffer cardiac failure stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function while still in a research phase stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology stem cells provide hope for new beginnings small incremental steps cells rather than organs repair rather than replacement stem cell therapies may one day reduce the need powerful new technologies always present enigmas as we speak the world 's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently and in the u k neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial the research success that we celebrate today has been made possible by the curiosity and contribution and commitment of individual scientists and medical pioneers one has his story my story has been about my journey from organs to cells a journey through controversy inspired by hope hope that as we age you and i may one day celebrate longevity with an improved quality of life"
