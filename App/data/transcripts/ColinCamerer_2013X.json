  "transcript": "'m going to talk about the strategizing brain we 're going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line so game theory is a a branch of originally applied mathematics used mostly in economics and political science a little bit in biology that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life cooperation bargaining and poker here 's a simple game to get us started everyone chooses a number from zero to one hundred we 're going to compute the average of those numbers and whoever 's closest to two thirds of the average but not too far below and everyone else wants to be a little bit below the average number as well think about what you might pick triggering a crash you want to be a little bit ahead of the competition okay here 's two theories about how people might think about this and then we 'll see some data some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way i 'm using my brain theory to see a lot of people say i really don 't know what people are going to pick so i think the average will be fifty they 're not being really strategic at all and i 'll pick that 's a start other people who are a little more sophisticated using more working memory say i think people will pick thirty three because they 're going to pick a response to fifty and so i 'll pick twenty two which is doing one extra step of thinking two steps that 's better this is called a cognitive hierarchy theory by the way i 've worked on and a few other people and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected by lots of interesting variables and variant people as we 'll see in a minute a very different theory a much more popular one and an older one due largely to john nash of a beautiful mind fame is what 's called you will have learned a little bit about this an equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do it is a very but behaviorally it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world the contest said send in your numbers and as you can see there 's so much data here you can see the spikes very visibly there 's a spike at thirty three those are people doing one step there is another spike visible at so they 're smart but poor where are these things happening in the brain so they had people play this game while they were being scanned in an fmri and two conditions in some trials they 're told you 're playing another person who 's playing right now and we 're going to match up your behavior at the end and pay you if you win in the other trials they 're told you so what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there 's more brain activity when you 're playing people compared to playing the computer and ventromedial prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate an area that 's involved in lots of types of conflict resolution like if you 're playing simon says and also the right and left temporoparietal and these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what 's called a theory of mind circuit or mentalizing circuit so these were some of the first studies to see this tied in to game theory the reason is they 're treating other people like a so we know that those two step players are doing something differently now if you were to step back and say what can we do with this information you might be able to look at brain activity and say this person 's going to be a good poker player or this person 's socially naive and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an i 'm saving you some brain activity because you don 't need to use your hair detector cells this is a bargaining game two players who are being scanned using eeg electrodes are going to bargain over one to six dollars if they can do it in ten seconds they 're going to actually earn that money if ten seconds goes by and they haven 't made a deal the twist is that one player on the left is informed about how much on each trial there is they play lots of trials with different amounts each time in this case they know there 's four dollars so the uninformed player 's challenge is to say is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there 's only one or two dollars available to split in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal so there 's some tension here between trying to get the most money and the so this is like a management labor negotiation in which they want to maybe hold out for more money but the company might want to create the impression that there 's very little to split i 'm giving you the most that i can it 's good for so they have a chance of they bicker and disagree and end up with less money they might be eligible to be on real housewives the tv show and when the amount is four five six they agree quite this turns out to be something that 's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at caltech and learn about and the left is the informed remember that we we scanned both brains at the just like if you wanted to study a conversation and the arrowhead goes to the region that 's active so in this case if you look carefully most of the arrows and then it 's followed by activity in the informed brain and by the way these were trials where their deals were made but the hope is that we can say something in the first couple of seconds about whether they 'll make a deal or not which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation and ugly divorces and things like that those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost by delay and strikes here 's the case where the disagreements occur you can see it looks different than the one before there 's a lot more arrows that is the informed brain seems to be deciding we 're probably not going to make a deal here and then later there 's activity in the uninformed brain maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you we share ninety eight point eight percent of the genes we share more genes with them than zebras so this is an amazing memory test from nagoya japan primate research institute where they 've done a lot of this research this goes back quite a ways they 're interested in working then they disappear and they 're replaced by squares and they have to press the squares that correspond to the numbers from low to high to get an apple reward let 's see how they can do it the young ones are better than the old ones just like humans and they 're highly experienced so they 've done this thousands and thousands of time obviously there 's a big training effect as you can imagine you can see they 're very blas and kind of effortless not only can they do it very well they do it in a sort of lazy way right who thinks you could beat the chimps next part of this study i 'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of tetsuro matsuzawa he had a bold idea that what he called the cognitive trade off hypothesis we know chimps are faster and stronger they 're also very obsessed with status maybe they 've preserved brain activities and they practice them in development so we to check that out by having the chimps actually play a game by one chimp is called a matcher they win if they press left left like a they want to press the this is a graph of the percentage of times the matcher picked right on the x axis and the percentage of times they predicted right by the mismatcher on the ch and qre those are three different theories of nash equilibrium and others tells you what the theory predicts which is that they should match 50 50 now we move the payoffs we 're actually going to make the left left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher now they get three apple cubes game theoretically make sure he doesn 't get it and as you can see their behavior moves up in the direction of this change and their behavior again moves towards the nash equilibrium it 's sprinkled around but if you average the chimps out they 're really really close within 01 they 're actually closer than any species we 've observed what about humans you think you 're smarter than a chimpanzee the chimps are playing better than the humans better in the sense of adhering to game theory and these are two different groups of humans from japan and africa they replicate quite nicely none of them are to where the chimps are"
