  "transcript": "i had no idea what to expect ominous music playing in the background but it wasn 't like that at all there was music playing on this day i think it was madonna 's greatest hits but every so often the music gets turned down everyone stops talking and stares at exactly the and that 's when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening the first time i saw that i was watching a type of surgery called laparoscopic surgery and for those of you who are unfamiliar laparoscopic surgery instead of the large open incision you might be used to with surgery and then inserts these long and actually does the procedure inside the patient this is great because there 's much less risk of infection much less pain shorter recovery time but there is a trade off because these incisions are created pointed device called a trocar and the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through and now the reason why everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day but this problem should seem pretty familiar to all of you because i 'm pretty sure you 've seen it somewhere else you knew that at any second that straw but you were terrified and it turns out it really is a problem again in two thousand and nine we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery and oh by the way so when i got to graduate school this is what i wanted to work on i was trying to explain to a friend of mine what exactly i was spending my time doing and i said it 's like when you 're drilling through a wall to hang something in your apartment there 's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall and there 's this and he looked at me and he said you mean like when they drill into people 's brains and i said excuse me and if the surgeon isn 't careful he can plunge directly into the brain so this is the moment when i started thinking okay cranial drilling why not other areas of medicine because think about it when was the last time you went to the doctor and you didn 't get stuck with something and here are just a couple of the procedures that i 've found that involve some tissue puncture step and if we take just three of them laparoscopic and cranial drilling so let 's take a look at some of the devices that are used in these types of procedures i mentioned epidurals this is an epidural needle it 's used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth here 's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools these are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions here 's a bayonette from the civil war if i had told you it was a medical puncture device you probably would have believed me so the more i did this research the more i thought there has to be a better way to do and for me equal and opposite but then there 's that moment when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall and right at that moment the wall but your brain hasn 't reacted to that change in force but what if what if right at the moment of puncture you could pull that tip back actually oppose the forward acceleration that 's what i set out to do so when you extend that spring you extend that tip out so it 's ready to puncture tissue how do you keep the tip in place until the moment of puncture i used this mechanism when the tip of the device is pressed against tissue the mechanism expands outwards and wedges in place against the wall so the mechanism unlocks and the spring retracts the tip let me show you that happening in slow motion this is about two thousand frames a second and i 'd like you to notice the tip that 's right there on the bottom about to puncture through tissue right at the moment of puncture right there the mechanism unlocks and retracts that tip back i and right when it punctures that rubber membrane it 's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath right there that happens of a second after puncture but it worked and but i think it should fascinate you too because i said puncture is everywhere that means at some point it 's going to be your problem too that first day in the operating room i never expected to find myself on the other end of a trocar but last year i got appendicitis when i was visiting greece so i was in the hospital in athens and the surgeon was telling me he was going to perform a laparoscopic surgery he was going to remove my appendix through these tiny incisions and he was talking about what i could expect for the recovery and what was going to happen he said do you have any questions and i said just one doc what kind of trocar do you use so my favorite quote about laparoscopic surgery comes from a doctor h c jacobaeus it is puncture itself and he wrote that in one thousand nine hundred and twelve so it 's easy to think that for every major problem out there we have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them allow yourself to be fascinated because there are so many lives to save"
