  "transcript": "i suspect that every aid worker in africa comes to a time in her career when she wants to take all the money for her project maybe it 's a school or a training program pack it in a suitcase get on a plane flying over the poorest villages in the country hard cash into the hands of the poorest people on earth i had that moment right about the 10 year mark and and it 's only now with more evidence and new technology that it 's possible to make this a model for delivering i held two assumptions one that poor people are poor in part because they 're uneducated and don 't make good choices two is that we then need people like me to figure out what they need and get it to them it turns out the evidence says otherwise in recent years researchers have been studying what happens when we give poor people cash dozens of studies show across the board that people use cash transfers to improve their own lives researchers who studied our work in kenya found that people invested in a range of assets from and they saw increases in income from business and farming one year after the cash was sent none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people work less in fact they work more these are all material needs elderly recipients used their cash transfers to pay for coffins as someone who i find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs deeply humbling i don 't know if i would have chosen to give food or equipment or which begs the question how good are we at allocating resources on behalf of the poor are we worth the cost again we can look at empirical evidence on what happens when we give people stuff of our choosing one very telling study looked at a program in india that gives livestock to the and they found that thirty percent of recipients had turned around and sold the livestock they had been given for cash the real irony is for every one hundred dollars worth of assets this program gave someone they spent another ninety nine dollars to do it whether from aid agencies or from any one of us directly into a poor person 's hands today three in which is basically a bank account that can run on any cell phone a sender can pay a one point six percent fee and with the click of a button send money directly to a recipient 's account with no intermediaries like the technologies that are disrupting industries in payments technology in poor countries could disrupt aid it 's spreading so quickly that it 's possible to imagine reaching billions of the world 's poor this way that 's what we 've started to do at givedirectly we 're the first organization dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor we 've sent cash to thirty five thousand people across rural kenya and uganda so far we 've looked for the poorest people in the poorest villages and in this part of the world they we show up at your door with an android phone we 'll get your take your photo and a photo of your hut and grab the gps coordinates that night we send all the data to the cloud and each piece gets checked by an independent team then we 'll come back we 'll sell you a basic cell phone if you don 't have one already we send money to it something that five years ago would have seemed impossible we can now do efficiently and free of corruption and the more evidence we have that it works the more we have to reconsider everything else we give today the logic behind aid is too often well we do at least some good when we 're complacent with that as our bar when we tell ourselves that giving aid is better than no aid at all we tend to invest inefficiently in our own ideas that strike us as innovative on writing reports on plane tickets and suvs what if the logic was will we do better than cash given directly organizations would have to prove that they 're doing more good for the poor than the poor can do for themselves of course giving cash won 't create public goods like but it could set a higher bar for how we help individual families improve their lives i believe most aid is better than just throwing money out of a plane i am also absolutely certain that a lot of aid today i hope that one day it will be"
