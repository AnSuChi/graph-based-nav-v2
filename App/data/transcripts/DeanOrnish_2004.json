  "transcript": "is on natural wonders and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness i want to try to combine them all because to me healing is really the ultimate natural wonder your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing i love doing this work because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didnt have before and it allows us to talk about things that not just but that happiness is not we 're talking about the pursuit of happiness but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions what aldous huxley called the perennial wisdom when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people but rather all of these different practices you know the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didnt develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure unclog your arteries even though it can do all those things theyre powerful tools for transformation for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy to be peaceful to be joyful and to realize that its not something that you pursue and get but rather its something that you have already until you disturb it with a teacher named swami satchidananda and people would say what are you a hindu hed say no im an undo and its really stress management which are really these spiritual practices moderate exercise smoking cessation and its not a diet you know when most people think about the diet i recommend they think its a really strict diet for reversing disease thats what it takes youre going to live longer youre going to feel better youre going to lose and in our studies what weve been able to do is to use very expensive high tech state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost and in many ways ancient interventions can be we first began by looking at heart disease and when i began doing this work twenty six or twenty seven years ago it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse and what we found was that instead of getting worse and worse in many cases this is a representative patient who at the time was seventy three totally needed to have a bypass decided to do this instead we used quantitative arteriography showing the narrowing this is one of the arteries that feed the heart one of the main arteries and you can see the narrowing here a year later its not as clogged normally it goes the other direction these minor changes in blockages caused a three hundred percent improvement in blood huge differences can occur without drugs without surgery within a month like most people was pain free and within a year climbing more than one hundred floors a day on a stairmaster this is not unusual because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life they got worse and worse from one year to five years in the comparison group this is the natural history of heart disease but its really not natural because we found it could get better and better and much more quickly we also found that the more people change the better they got it wasnt a function of how old or how sick they were it was mainly how much they changed and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones programs the younger brother is eighty six the older ones ninety five they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were and the following year they sent me this one which i thought was kind of funny you just and we get so if we change insurance then we change medical practice and medical education insurance will cover the bypass itll cover the angioplasty it wont until recently cover diet and lifestyle and we found that most people could avoid surgery and not only was it medically effective it was also cost effective and the insurance companies found that they began to save almost thirty thousand dollars per patient and medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where theyre paying for one thousand eight hundred people to go through the program on the sites that we train the fortuneteller says i give smokers a discount because theres not as much to tell i like this slide because its a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change and what doesnt and what doesnt work is fear of dying and thats whats normally used everybody who smokes knows its not good for you and still thirty percent of americans smoke why do people do it well because it helps them get through the day and ill talk more about this but the real epidemic isnt just heart disease or obesity or smoking its loneliness and depression as one woman said ive got twenty friends in this package of cigarettes and theyre always there for me and nobody else is youre going to take away my twenty friends what are you going to give me or they eat when they get depressed or they use alcohol to numb the pain or they work too hard or watch too much tv there are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem and the pain is not the problem its the symptom and so they dont want to think about it so they dont the most effective anti smoking ad was this one youll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth and why because a lot of guys need it its not like you say hey joe im having erectile dysfunction how about you and yet look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold so does cocaine so does a high fat diet so does emotional stress so the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture and these things occur within hours this is a study a high fat meal and within one or two hours the blood flow doesnt go down it even goes up you get big benefits and you feel so much better so quickly for many people those are i want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic because it really is a problem two thirds of adults are overweight or obese and diabetes in kids and 30 year olds has increased seventy percent in the last ten years its no joke its real these are not election returns these are the percentage of people who are overweight and if you see from but it doesnt you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories now one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food or if you restrict entire categories of foods but the problem is you get hungry so its hard to keep it off and its the volume of food that affects satiety rather than the type of food you know i dont like talking about the atkins diet but i get asked about it every day and so i just thought id spend a few minutes on that the myth that you hear about is americans have been told to eat less fat the percent of calories from fat is down americans are fatter than ever therefore and even more carbs and so the percentage is lower the actual amount is higher and so the goal is to reduce both dr atkins and i debated each other many times before he died and we agreed that americans eat too many simple carbs the bad carbs and these are things like you get all these calories dont fill you up because youve removed the fiber and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down which is good but insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat so the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages these are not health foods but to go from bad carbs to what are called good carbs and these are things like whole foods or unrefined carbs fruits vegetables whole wheat flour brown rice in their natural forms are rich in fiber and the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories and it slows the absorption so you dont get that rapid rise in blood sugar so and you get all the but also what you include thats protective just as all carbs are not bad for you all fats are not bad for you there are good fats and these are predominantly what are called the omega 3 and the bad fats are things like trans fatty acids and processed food and saturated you dont remember anything else from this talk three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by fifty to eighty percent three grams a day they come in one gram capsules more than that just gives you extra fat you dont need it also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast prostate and colon cancer everybody knows people who have lost weight on it but you can lose weight on amphetamines you know and fen phen i mean there are lots of ways of losing weight that arent good for you you want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it youll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less while your cholesterol level has remained the same the research findings have changed the red is good at the beginning and a year later this is from a study done in yes you can lose weight but your heart isnt happy now one of the studies funded by the atkins center found that seventy percent of the people were constipated sixty five percent had bad percent had headaches this is not a healthy way to eat and so you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you but when they get too close its going to be a problem and more seriously there are case reports now of 16 year old girls who died after a few weeks on the atkins diet of bone disease kidney disease and so on they begin to smell bad not to mention whatever ethical concerns people there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health now were about to publish the first study ucsf we took ninety men who had biopsy proven prostate cancer and who had elected for reasons unrelated to the study not to have surgery we could randomly divide them into two groups and then we could have one group that is a non intervention control group to compare to which we cant do with say breast cancer because everyone gets treated what we was that after a year none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment whereas six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation when we looked at their psa levels which is a marker for prostate cancer they got worse in the control group but they actually got better in the experimental group and these differences were highly significant and then i wondered was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle whichever group they were in and the changes in i then wondered well maybe theyre just changing their psa but its not really affecting the tumor growth so we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to ucla they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture along with the psa going down and whether or not you have conventional treatment in addition if you make these changes it may help reduce the risk of recurrence the last thing i want to talk about apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely in part because but also through mechanisms that we dont fully understand people who are lonely and depressed are many times three to five to ten times in some studies more likely to get sick and die prematurely and depression is treatable we need to do something about that now on the other hand anything that promotes intimacy is it can be sexual intimacy i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing altruism compassion service all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures once you stop trying to see the differences these are the things in our own self interest because they free us from our suffering and from disease and its in a sense the most selfish thing that we can at one study this was done by david spiegel at stanford he took women with metastatic breast cancer randomly divided them into two groups one group of people just met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group it was a nurturing loving environment where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood because they were going through it too they just met once a week for a year five years later those women lived twice as long and you can see that the people and that was the only difference between the groups it was a randomized control study published in the lancet so these simple things that create intimacy are really healing and even the word healing it comes from the root to make whole the word yoga comes from the sanskrit meaning union to yoke to bring together"
