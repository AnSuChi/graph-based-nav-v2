  "transcript": "a place that i now call home it 's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve so this is bertie county north carolina usa to give you an idea of the where so here 's north carolina and if we zoom in and it 's very flat it 's very swampy it the entire county is home to just twenty thousand people and they 're very sparsely distributed so there 's only twenty seven people per square mile which comes down to about ten people per square kilometer we 've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the american borders the brain drain where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back it 's the dependence on farm subsidies and under performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with like many communities similar to it is that there 's no shared collective investment in the future of rural communities only six point eight percent of all our philanthropic giving in the u s right now benefits rural communities and yet twenty percent of our population lives there it is the poorest county in the state and it 's what is referred to as a rural ghetto the economy is mostly agricultural the biggest crops are cotton and tobacco the biggest employer is the purdue chicken processing plant the county seat is windsor this is like times square of windsor that you 're looking at right now it 's home to only two thousand people and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years there are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use but in the whole county there is no coffee shop there 's no internet cafe there 's no movie theater there 's no so the public school students are about eighty six percent african american and this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class and you can see the difference is pretty stark there 's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor 's degree or higher so there isn 't a big legacy in the pride of education in fact two years ago only twenty seven percent of all the third through eighth graders were passing the state standard in both english and math so it dr z he was brought in in october two thousand and seven as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system he previously was a superintendent in charleston south carolina and then in denver colorado u s and he is so in february of two thousand and nine dr zullinger invited us project h design which is a non profit design firm that i founded to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don 't usually have access to design services or creative capital specifically we use these six design directives probably the most important being number two we design with not for in that it 's about designing with people and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of two thousand and nine spending about half our time in bertie county and when i say we i mean project but more specifically i mean myself and my partner matthew miller who 's an architect and a sort of macgyver type builder so fast forward to today and we now live there i have strategically cut matt 's head out of this photo because he would kill me if he knew i was using it but we now call this place home over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth we realized we had fallen in love with the place we had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that you can 't do everywhere there 's space to experiment and to weld and to test things we have an amazing advocate in dr zullinger there 's a nobility of real work but beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there there is a huge need there is a total vacuum of creative capital in and so we we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool something that bertie county didn 't otherwise have and to be sort of the to usher that in as a new type of tool in in their tool kit the initial goal became using design within the public education system as a community was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness so in order to do this we 've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education and i should say that these are three things that we 've done in bertie county but i feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other so the first of the three is design for education it 's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students this is in response to the the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we 're building schools out of these days the computer lab is a come in you face the wall you take your test and you leave so we wanted to change the way that students approach technology to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging more accessible and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology based instruction and this also meant the the co creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape it allows elementary level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity you take the class divide it into two teams one team on each side of the playground and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires and then she 'll call out a math problem so let 's say four times four and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is sixteen and find the tire with the sixteen on it and sit on it so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins and the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores scores a greater comfort level with the material especially with the boys that in going outside and playing they aren 't afraid to take on a double digit multiplication problem so with design for education i think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers they have the incentive and the desire to use them so this is mr perry he 's the assistant superintendent he came out for one of our teacher training days and won like five rounds of match me in a row and was very proud of himself it 's a how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change which is easier said than done in rural communities and in and this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system which i find myself squatting outside of a lot it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community it asked them we 're helping dr zullinger develop and then the third approach which is what i 'm most excited about which is where we are now is design as education so design as education means that we could actually teach design within public schools and not design based learning not like let 's learn physics by building a rocket but actually coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose it also means that designers are no longer consultants but we 're teachers and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation and what design offers verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by it 's a vocational training path projects are things like let 's make a birdhouse for your mom for christmas so we thought what if you could bring back shop class but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed and to infuse shop class with a more critical and studio process so we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with dr zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one year curriculum offered at the high school to the junior class and so this starts in four weeks at the end of the summer and my partner and i matthew and i just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it and this is what it looks like so over the course of two semesters the fall and the spring the students spend three hours a day every single day in our four thousand five hundred square foot studio and during that time they 're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need finding coming back into the studio doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts figuring out if they are going to work and refining that so the first project which will be built next summer followed by so these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say i built that and i 'm want you to meet three of our students this is ryan she is fifteen years old she loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher she wants to go to college but she wants to come back to bertie county because that 's where her family is from where she calls home and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she 's been fairly fortunate in so what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way and he wants to be an architect loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything and so for him studio h means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands on engagement he 's interested in forestry but he isn 't sure so if he ends so this building downtown which may very well become the site of our future farmers ' market is now the classroom and going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and and from where and why that 's a homework assignment and the ribbon cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers ' market and it 's open to the public that 's the final exam and for the community what design and building offers is real visible built progress it 's one project per year and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future so we recognize that studio h especially in its first year is a small story but we feel like this could work in other places and i really strongly believe in the power of the small story because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale because when you zoom out that far you lose the ability to view people as humans we need to work outside of our comfort zones more and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design thank you"
