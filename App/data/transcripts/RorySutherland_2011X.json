  "transcript": "it 's something that since it was invented a year or two ago has given me untold happiness a little bit of it i think is the nicotine but there 's something much bigger than that which is ever since in the uk they banned smoking in public places i 've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again which is when you go to a drinks party and you stand up and hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people sometimes you just want to stand there silently alone sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window now if you stand and stare out of the window on your own you 're an antisocial friendless idiot if you stand and stare out of the window on your own so the power of reframing things but one of them makes you feel great and the other one with just a small change of posture makes you feel terrible why for example are pensioners much happier you both have too much time on your hands and not much money whereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed whereas the young unemployed feel it 's been thrust upon them in england the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly but having a son who 's unemployed in thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment laughter but actually the power to re brand things to don 't actually much depend on what they really are but on how we view them i genuinely think can 't be overstated there 's an experiment i think daniel pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has every now and then an electric shock which pains the dogs the only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box and when it nuzzles the button the electric shock stops but it has no control over the circumstances generally the first dog can be relatively content the second dog lapses into complete depression it 's an interesting question but i think there 's another debate to be asked which is the level of control we have over our tax money that what costs us ten pounds in one context can be a curse what costs us ten pounds in a different context we may actually welcome you know pay twenty thousand pounds in tax and you 're called a philanthropist i 'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax 'll give you one in return how you frame things really matters do you call it the bailout of greece or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to greece because they are actually the same thing what you call them actually affects how you react to them i think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest one of my great friends but what we don 't have is a really good model of human psychology at least pre kahneman perhaps we didn 't have a really good model of human psychology to put alongside models of engineering of neoclassical economics so people who believed in psychological solutions didn 't have a model we didn 't have a framework this is what warren buffett 's business partner charlie munger calls a latticework on which to hang your classical economists all had a very very robust existing latticework on which practically every idea could be hung we merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model and what that means is that in looking at solutions we 've probably given too much priority to what i call technical engineering solutions newtonian solutions and not nearly enough to the psychological ones you know my example of the eurostar six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between paris and london by about forty minutes but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefulness far more for maybe ten percent of the money you could have paid all of the world 's top male and female supermodels to walk up and chteau ptrus to all the passengers you 'd still have five million pounds in change and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically i think it 's because there 's an an asymmetry in the way we treat creative emotionally driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational numerical spreadsheet driven ideas if you 're a creative person i think quite rightly you have to share all your ideas for approval with people much more rational than you but this does not apply the other way around people who have an existing framework an economic framework an engineering framework what they don 't say is well the numbers all seem to add up but before i present this idea i 'll show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better and so we artificially i think prioritize what i 'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas an example of a great psychological idea the single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the london underground per pound spent came when they didn 't add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains they put dot matrix display boards on the platforms because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality its but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock is less frustrating and irritating than waiting four minutes knuckle biting going when 's this train going to damn well arrive here 's a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in korea why because impatience and general irritation are massively reduced when you can actually see the the time you have to wait in china not really understanding the principle behind this they applied the same principle to green traffic lights you floor it it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights this is all i 'm asking for really in human decision making is the consideration of these three things i 'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other i 'm merely saying that when you solve problems you should look at all three of these equally if you actually look at a great business see all of these three things coming into play really successful businesses google is a great great technological success but it 's also based on a very good psychological insight it 's an innate ayelet fishbach has written a paper about this google understood that if you 're just a search engine people assume you 're a very very good search engine all of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television and in the shabbier end of the row of are these rather despised things called combined tv and dvd players and we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things but we look at a combined tv and dvd player and we go uck it 's probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a dvd player so we walk out of the shops with one of each google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one i propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn 't even realize were problems at all this is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics don 't give them twenty four white pills give them eighteen white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones it 's called chunking the likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle cost but also its meaning you could apply the same principle actually what would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to it 's not an unreasonable thing to do it 's an economically efficient thing to do you 'd patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the the fast lane if you 're on the way to visit your mother in law you 'd probably prefer probably prefer to stay on the left the only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution people hate it because they think you 're deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue and why on earth should i pay to subsidize your incompetence it goes to charity and the mental willingness to pay completely changes but where i think that money it could actually change things quite significantly [ ludwig von mises is my hero ] what was interesting about the austrian school grew up alongside freud and so they 're predominantly interested in psychology they believed that there was a discipline called praxeology which is a prior discipline to the study of economics praxeology is the study of human choice action and decision making i think the danger we have in today 's world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology but as charlie munger says behavioral i don 't know what the hell is i think he just refers to economics as the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity i think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation for the value of marketing the value of perceived value and the fact that we should treat it as being absolutely equivalent to any other kind of value von mises completely rejected this distinction and he used this following analogy he referred to strange economists called the french physiocrats you created true value if however you bought some wool you weren 't actually creating you were exploiting the shepherd he says if you run a restaurant there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking the food and the value you create by sweeping the floor one of them creates perhaps the primary product the thing we think we 're paying for the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product and the idea that one of them should have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong try this quick thought experiment imagine a restaurant that serves michelin starred food but where the restaurant smells of sewage and there 's human feces on the floor the best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to improve the food still further it 's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor vital we understand this if that seems like a sort of strange abstruse thing in the uk the post office had a ninety eight percent success rate at delivering first class mail the next day they decided this wasn 't good enough and they wanted to get it up to ninety nine the effort to do that almost broke the organization the same time you 'd gone and asked people what percentage of first class mail arrives the next day the average answer what on earth are you doing ninety eight percent of first class mail gets there the because generally in britain if you want to make us happy about something just tell us we do it better than the germans choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely transformed it has to be said of the germans that the only thing they didn 't expect is they 're uniting europe through a shared mild hatred of the french and germans but i 'm british that 's the way we like it what you 'll also notice is that in any case our perception is leaky we can 't tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it all of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted when you drive away your car feels as if it drives better and the reason for this unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil and performing work which i 'm not paying him for and i 'm unaware of is because perception is in any case leaky analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain than analgesics that are not branded i don 't just mean through reported pain reduction actual measured pain reduction and so perception so if you do something that 's perceptually bad in one respect you can damage the other thank you very much"
