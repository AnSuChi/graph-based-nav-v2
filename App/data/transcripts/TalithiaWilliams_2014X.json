  "transcript": "as a kid i always loved growing up i 'd be frustrated at how my own parents would lie to if i 've told you once i 've told you a thousand times no dad you 've only told me seventeen times and twice it wasn 't my fault i think that is one of the reasons i got a ph d in statistics i always wanted to know what are people trying to hide with numbers i want people to show me the data so i can decide for myself statisticians we call that being within the ninety five percent confidence interval laughter and at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby and this is just routine it tests whether or not the baby is feeling any type of undue stress so we go in for a stress test and after twenty minutes the doctor comes out and he says we need to induce you show me the data so then he proceeds to tell us the baby 's heart rate trace went from eighteen minutes the baby 's heart rate was in the normal zone and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be my heart rate zone and i said is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate i was moving around a little bit it 's hard to lay still on your back maybe it was shifting around he said well we don 't want to take any chances what if i was at thirty six weeks with this same data would your decision be to induce well no i would thirty eight weeks but you are almost forty two there is no reason to leave that baby inside let 's get you a room we can average the two and see what that means just don 't want you to have a miscarriage that makes three of us and then he says your chances of having a miscarriage double so now as a statistician and we really just want what 's best for the baby pregnant women how many of them are going to miscarry just before their due date and then he looks at me so of those one thousand women how many are going so you are telling me that my chances go from a chance to a and so then we proceed to have a conversation about how inductions lead to a higher rate of cesarean sections and if at all possible we 'd like to avoid that and then i said and i really don 't think my due date is accurate and so this really stunned him you may not know this but pregnancy due dates are calculated assuming that you have a standard 28 day cycle and my cycle ranges and i have been collecting the data to prove it laughter and so we ended up leaving the hospital that day without being induced we actually had to sign a waiver to walk out of the hospital and i 'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors because even with our first child we were induced at fluid was low i 'm not we had been collecting data i had this temperature data and it told a different story in fact a story you want to tell at your kid 's wedding reception i remember like it was yesterday my temperature was a sizzling ninety seven point eight degrees as i stared into your father 's confident to leave because we had been collecting data now what does that data look like here 's a standard chart of a woman 's waking body temperature during the course of a cycle so from the beginning of the menstrual cycle till the beginning of the next you 'll see that the temperature is not random clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her cycle so what 's happening here what is that data telling you well ladies at the beginning of our cycle the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen causes a suppression of your body temperature and at ovulation your body releases an egg and progesterone takes over so why this temperature jump why is she sitting on them and if nothing sometimes you actually see another shift in your temperatures and it stays elevated for those whole nine months that 's why you see those pregnant women just sweating and hot because their temperatures are high here 's a chart that we had about three or four years ago we were really very excited about this chart you 'll see the low temperature level and then a shift confirmed with a pregnancy test that were indeed pregnant with our first child very exciting until a couple of days later i saw some spotting and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage but we actually had data to show that we had miscarried this baby we what is it that we can do to help prevent this problem tell us a lot of things for instance did you know that taking your temperature can tell you a lot about the condition of your thyroid there is an optimal temperature that you want in your house you set your thermostat when it gets too cold in the house your thermostat kicks in and says hey we need to blow or if it gets too hot your thermostat registers turn the a c on cool us off that 's exactly how your thyroid works in your body when it doesn 't function then it shows up in your body temperatures they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic and so by collecting this data you can find out information about your thyroid what is it if you had a thyroid problem and you went to the doctor your doctor would actually test the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood but the problem with that test is it doesn 't tell you how active the hormone is in i advocate that you do but there are tons of other things you could take you could take your blood pressure you could take your weight yeah who 's excited about taking their weight every day donald had a stuffy nose and he had been taking a slew of medications to try to relieve his stuffy nose i can 't breath out of my nose and i roll over and i look and i said well can you breath out of your mouth i can 't breath out of my nose and so like any good wife i rush him to the emergency room you can 't die on me now people will think i killed and so she brings us to the back and and the doctor says what seems to be the problem and he goes i can 't breath out of my nose and he said but he can breath out of his mouth he takes a step back and he looks at both of us and he says sir i think i know the problem a heart attack i 'm going to order an ekg and a cat scan for you immediately not a heart attack he can breathe just and so we go back and forth with this doctor because we think this is the incorrect and so fortunately for us this doctor was at the end of the shift so this new doctor comes in he sees us clearly distraught with a husband who can 't breath out of his nose what was donald doing just before so donald goes into this slew of medications clogs you up every time here take this one instead he gives us a prescription we 're looking at each other and i looked at the doctor and i said why is it that it seems like you were able to accurately diagnose his condition but this previous doctor wanted to order an ekg man walks in the emergency room and says he can 't breath you assume he 's having a heart attack and you ask questions later and so had we had some information about our heart health to share with him maybe we would have gotten a better diagnosis the first time i want you to consider the following chart of systolic blood pressure measurements from october two thousand and ten to july two thousand and twelve you 'll see that these measurements start in the but over about the course of a year and a half they move into the normal zone this is about the heart rate of a healthy telling you so that 350 pound guy that walked into the emergency room with me is now an even sexier and healthier so over the course of that year and a half donald 's eating changed and our exercise regimen changed and his heart rate responded his blood pressure responded to that change that he made in his body"
