  "transcript": "'m going to talk about the power of a word jihad to the vast majority of practicing muslims jihad is an internal struggle temptation lust greed it is a struggle to try and live a life that is in that original idea the concept of jihad is as important to muslims as the idea of grace is to if you look at it in that respect and there 's a certain their daughters as much as their sons in the same way that say christians name their daughters who believe that jihad is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle against forces that would threaten the faith or the faithul and some of these people believe that in that struggle it is sometimes okay and they named themselves the mujahideen which is a word that comes from the same root forget this now but back then we thought of them as as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists but within that group a tiny smaller group a minority within a minority within a minority were coming up with a new new and dangerous and in time this group would come to be led by osama bin laden primarily targeted at the far enemy at the crusaders from the and had such great impact that his definition was the one that stuck we just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were calling what they did jihad then that 's what jihad must mean but it wasn 't just us even in the muslim world his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance after the old meaning he hoped that a name like that would inspire her to live a spiritual life but he told me that after nine eleven the people who came to and claimed victory for it and so the old imam worried that he was wrong some people were paying attention but for the wrong reasons the united states and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs they had never paid him any attention before old man small mosque and sometimes they would drag him in for questions and always the same question you name your granddaughter why do you keep using the word jihad in your friday sermons do you hate americans what is your connection to osama bin laden so to the tunisian intelligence agency and organizations like it all over the arab world bin laden 's definition had become institutionalized that was the power of that word that he was able to do and it filled this this old imam it filled him with great sadness he told me that of bin laden 's many crimes this was in his mind one that didn 't get enough attention that he took this word this he didn 't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it and then persuaded all of us that it always was but the good news is that the global jihad is almost over as bin laden defined it opinion polls from all over the muslim world show that there is very little interest among muslims the supply of of young men willing to the supply of money just as important more important perhaps the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling the wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous sleep easy at night because if you let local and so there 's now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world in somalia in mali in nigeria there are groups that claim to be they use his rhetoric so there is now an al qaeda in the islamic maghreb there 's an al qaeda in the arabian peninsula there is an al qaeda in mesopotamia there are other groups in nigeria boko haram in somalia al shabaab and they or it 's a power struggle more often than not it 's a power struggle in occasionally they will go across a border from iraq to syria but that doesn 't mean that we can relax i was in yemen it 's the home of the last al qaeda franchise that still aspires attack the west it 's old school al qaeda you may remember these guys they are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here and they were using the internet to try and instigate but they have been distracted recently last year they took control over a portion of southern and then the yemeni military got its act together and ordinary people rose up against these guys and drove them out and since then most of their activities most of their attacks have been directed at yemenis but that 's still not reason because we 've seen that movie before and we said local jihad and then the taliban gave the keys of kandahar to osama bin laden he made it our problem if you ignore it becomes global jihad again and we can take the lessons we 've learned from and apply those what are those lessons seal team six who killed bin let 's start with bin laden himself he killed three thousand innocent people and that filled the muslim world with horror and revulsion he condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes of his own community he was the especially sadistic head of al qaeda in iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not americans sunni as well as shiites any claim that al qaeda had to being protectors of islam against the western crusaders was drowned in the blood who killed al jazeera did al jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people al jazeera brought information to them showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion exposed the hypocrisy of osama bin laden and al qaeda and allowed them gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions the arab spring did because it showed a way for young muslims to bring about change with their allies fighting in faraway battlefields and perhaps a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it so all these factors and many more besides we don 't even fully understand some of them yet these came together the and it 's unlikely that seal team six will rappel into the homes of al shabaab 's leaders and take them out but many of these other factors we don 't have to reinvent the wheel we don 't have to go back to that satellite television and and the internet and the arab spring has produced governments many of them islamist governments who we don 't need to persuade them but we do need to help them because they haven 't really come to this place before the good news again is that a lot of the things they need we already have and we are very good at giving technology knowhow technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective for their anti terror forces to become more efficient we 've got plenty of these things some of the other things that they need maybe nobody is time patience subtlety understanding these are harder to give i live in new york now just this week posters have gone up in subway stations in new york that describe jihad as savage we can say that"
