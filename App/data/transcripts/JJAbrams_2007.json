  "transcript": "i wanna start today talk about the structure of a polypeptide why so many mysteries what is it about mystery that that i seem to be drawn to and i was thinking about this what to talk about at ted when i talked to the the kind rep what should i talk about he said don 't worry about it just be profound i was trying to think what do i talk about it 's a good question why do i do so much stuff that involves mystery and i started trying to figure it out and i started thinking about why do i do any of what i do and i started thinking about my grandfather i loved harry kelvin was his name my mother 's father he died in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six he was an amazing guy and one of the reasons he was amazing after world war ii he began an electronics company as a kid i saw him come over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things and he 'd open them up he 'd unscrew them and reveal the inner workings which many of us i 'm sure take for granted but it 's an amazing gift to give a kid to open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is he was the ultimate deconstructer and my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts like printing like the letter press i 'm obsessed with printing i 'm obsessed with silk screening and and bookbinding and box making when i was a kid i was always like taking apart boxes and stuff and last night in the hotel i took apart the kleenex box and i 'm telling you rives is here and i met him years ago at a book fair he does pop up books and i 'm obsessed you know the registration marks for the ink i just love you know kind of got me into all sorts of these things he would also supply me with tools he was this amazing encourager this patron sort of to and he got me a super eight camera when i was ten years old and in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six that was sort of an anomaly to be a 10 year old kid that had access to a camera and you know he was so generous i couldn he wasn 't doing it entirely i really need this camera you don 't understand this is like you know i want to make movies i 'll get invited to ted one day this is like and you know and my grandmother was the greatest because she 'd be like you know she 'd get on the phone had a synthesizer when i was fourteen years old and it it let me make things which to me was sort of the dream he sort of humored my obsession to other things too like magic the thing is we 'd go to this magic store in new york city called lou tannen 's magic it was this great magic store it was a crappy little building in midtown but you 'd be in the elevator the elevator would open there 'd be this little small magic store you 'd be in the magic store and it was just it was which is good but now i can 't move now i have to do this the rest of the thing like this i 'm like oh wow look at my computer over there anyway tannen the premise behind the mystery magic box was the following fifteen dollars buys you fifty dollars worth of magic which is a savings now i bought this decades ago and i 'm not kidding if you look at this you 'll see it 's never been opened but i 've had this forever now i was looking at this it was in my office as it always is on the shelf and i was thinking why have i not opened this and why have i kept it because i and i felt like there was a key to this somehow in talking about something at ted that i haven 't discussed before and and i started thinking why haven 't i opened it and i realized that and what i realize i sort of do in whatever it is that i do is i i find myself drawn to infinite possibility that sense of potential and i realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination now it 's not the most ground breaking idea but when i started to think that maybe there are times when mystery and so i started thinking about lost and the stuff that we oh my god mystery boxes are everywhere in what i do in how in the creation of lost damon lindelof and i who created the show with me we were cut it post it turn in a two hour pilot so it was not a lot of time and that sense of possibility what could this thing be there was no time to develop it i 'm sure you 're all familiar with those people who tell you what you can 't do and what you should change and there was no time for that which is kind of amazing and so we did this show and for those of you who you know who haven 't seen it or don 't know it i can show you this one little clip from the pilot just to show you some we 'd actually so the amazing thing was we were able to do this thing and part of that was the amazing availability of technology knowing we could do anything i mean we could never have done that we might have been able to write it we wouldn 't have been able and so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process technology is like mind blowingly inspiring to me i that blank page is a magic box it needs to be filled with something fantastic i used to have the ordinary people script that i 'd flip through the romance of the script was amazing to me it would inspire me i wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script i love apple computers i 'm obsessed so the apple computer like those the powerbook this computer right it challenges me it basically says what are you going to write worthy of me i guess i feel this and i often am like you know dude today i 'm out i got nothing you know and it goes on find obi wan kenobi he 's so then you go and he meets ben kenobi ben kenobi is obi wan kenobi holy shit you know so it keeps us have with mystery boxes that i started feeling compelled then there 's the thing of mystery in terms of of imagination doing that intentionally is much more engaging whether it 's like the shark in and it 's loud and so they put the top up they 're in there you don 't hear anything they 're saying you can 't hear a word but it 's the most romantic date ever and you love it there 's this idea stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit but the idea of the mystery box meaning what you think you 're getting then what you 're really it 's about a guy who 's on the verge of divorce he 's showing up to l a tail between his legs there are great scenes maybe the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time but pretty great scenes there 's a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you 're you know expecting when you look at a movie like jaws scenes that you remember and expect from jaws and she 's being eaten there 's a shark the thing about jaws is it 's really about a guy who is sort of dealing with his place in the world with his masculinity with his family how he 's going to you know make it work in this and this is a scene that you wouldn 't necessarily think of when you think of stuff so that 's the kind of stuff that like or rip off movies you know of a genre they 're ripping off the wrong thing you 're not supposed to rip the shark or the monster you gotta rip off you know if you rip something off the mystery box and you 're full of that amazing that feeling whether it 's a tv an ipod computer cell phone it 's funny i 'm an as i said apple fanatic and one day about a year or so ago i was signing on online in the morning to watch steve jobs ' keynote ' cause i always do and he came on he was presenting the video ipod and what was on the enormous ipod behind and i realized holy shit it 'd come full circle like the inspiration i get from the technology is now using the stuff that i do inspired by it to sell technology i mean it 's nuts i was gonna show you a couple of other things i 'm gonna skip through i just want to show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything this is something online i don 't know if you 've seen it before six years ago they did this this is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience but the point was that they were doing things that were using these mystery boxes that they had everyone has now what i 've realized is what my grandfather did for me when i was a kid you don 't need to have my grandfather though you wished you had but i have to tell you this is a guy doing stuff on a quadra nine hundred and fifty computer using infinity software they stopped making fifteen years ago he 's doing stuff that looks as as amazing as stuff i 've seen released from hollywood the most incredible sort of mystery i think is now the question of what comes next because it is now democratized so now the creation of media is it 's everywhere the stuff that i was lucky and and begging for to get when i was a kid is now ubiquitous and so there 's an amazing sense of of opportunity out there and when i think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would have been silenced you know who have been silenced in the past it 's a very exciting thing i used to say in classes and lectures and stuff to someone who wants to write go write do your thing it 's free you know you don 't need permission to go write but now i can say go make your movie there 's nothing stopping you from going out there and getting the technology you can lease rent buy stuff off the shelf or just as good as the stuff that 's being used by the and i feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there when i did mission impossible iii we had amazing visual effects stuff ilm did the effects it was incredible and sort of like my dream and there are a couple of sequences in the movie like these couple of moments have an obsession with big crazy explosions so my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one i 'm about to show you and it 's a scene in which tom 's character wakes up he 's drowsy he 's crazy and he shoves this gun in his nose and shoots this little capsule into his brain that he 's going to use later to kill him as bad guys do and i learned this very early on in my career don 't hurt tom 's nose there are three things you don 't want to do number two is don 't hurt tom 's nose so eddie has this thought back to what i would have done using the super eight camera that my grandfather got me and i realized that hand didn 't have to be eddie marsan 's it could be tom 's"
