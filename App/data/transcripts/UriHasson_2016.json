  "transcript": "imagine that you invented a device that can record my memories my dreams my ideas and transmit them to your brain we already possess this device and it 's called human communication system and effective storytelling now we have to ask how these neuron patterns in my brain and we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate first your brain is now physically coupled to the sound wave that i 'm transmitting to your brain so how do we know that we bring people to the fmri scanner and we scan their brains while they and to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using let me play twenty seconds told by a very talented storyteller jim o 'grady jim o 'grady so i 'm banging out my story and i know it 's good and then i start to make it better by adding an element of but i had just seen the line crossed between a high powered dean so now let 's look into your brain and see what 's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories and let 's start simple let 's start with one listener and one brain area cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear and as you can see in this particular brain area the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding and we can ask how similar are the responses across all listeners and we start to scan their brains before the story starts when they 're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin immediately as the story is starting something amazing is happening jo so i 'm banging out my story and i know it 's good and then i start to make it uh suddenly you can see that the responses in all of the subjects this is exactly what is happening now in your brains when you think of these five metronomes as five brains and similar to the listeners before the story starts but they 're going to click out of phase now see what will happen when i connect them together by placing them on these two cylinders start to rotate this rotation vibration is going through the wood and is going to couple all the metronomes together and now listen to the click but removed and right on pie man potentially my stories uh but not more than that now we can take the words and start to build sentences out nice details didn 't she only know about him through me uh now you can see that the responses in all the language areas that process the incoming language become aligned or similar across all listeners engaging coherent story do the responses spread deeper into the brain into and we believe that these responses in higher order areas are induced and if we are right there 's a strong prediction over here if i tell you the exact same ideas using two very very different sets of words your brain responses will still be similar and to test it we did the following experiment in my lab we took the english story and you play the english story to the english listeners and we can compare their responses across the groups we did that we didn 't see responses that are similar in auditory cortices in language because the language and sound are very different however you can see that the responses in high order areas were still similar across these two groups as you can tell we think we can communicate because we have this so far i 've only talked about what 's happening in the listener 's brain in your happening in the speaker 's brain in my brain when i 'm speaking to you brain and then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story you have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech are very different processes saw that all these complex patterns and we also found the stronger the similarity so i know that if you are completely confused now and your brain and your brain are really similar to mine now let 's take all this information together and ask how can we use it to transmit a memory that i have from my so let 's be specific think about this exact scene when sherlock is entering the cab in london driven by the murderer he is looking for there is a specific brain pattern in my brain when i watch it now the exact same pattern i can reactivate in my brain again by telling the murderer and when i 'm transmitting these words to your brains now you have to reconstruct it in your mind in fact we see that pattern emerging now in your brains and we were really surprised to see that the pattern you have now in your brains when i 'm describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern i had when i watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner this starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information but i hope that at one point in the talk we and you got me and suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us now you can see how we can take this mechanism and try to transmit memories and knowledge across people which is wonderful right but our ability to communicate relies because for example if i 'm going to use the british synonym hackney carriage instead of cab i know that i 'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience this alignment depends not only on our ability to understand the basic it also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding and shared belief systems we took a story by asking did you see my wife for that the wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous this one sentence before the story started was enough to make the brain responses of all the people that believed the wife was having an affair be very similar in if one sentence is enough to make your brain similar to people that think like you and very different than people that think differently than you think how this effect is going to be amplified in real life when we are all listening to the exact same news item after being exposed day after day after day to different media channels like fox news or the new york times that give us very different perspectives on reality so let me summarize if everything worked as planned tonight i used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains and i used this coupling to transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas into your brains in this i start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate and we know that in the future it will enable us to but these studies also reveal that communication relies on a common ground and we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us and manipulate and control the way we all think and i 'm not sure how to fix it because i 'm only a scientist but maybe one way to do it but a more natural way of talking in which i am speaking and i am listening and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas because after all the people we are coupled to define who we are and our desire to be coupled to another brain is something very basic that starts at a very so let me finish with an example from my own private life that i think is a good example of how coupling to other people see how he developed a vocal game together with my wife only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being the ability of my son to be coupled to us and other people in his life is going to shape the man he is going to become because the sum of all of us thank you"
