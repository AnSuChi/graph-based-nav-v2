  "transcript": "it 's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what 's on their bookshelves well when i asked myself this question a i made an alarming discovery but my bookshelves told a rather different story and there was almost nothing in translation and when i thought about it it seemed like a real shame and it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant i would probably never encounter them so i decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading two thousand and twelve was set to be a very international year for the uk it was the year of the london olympics but it started with some practical problems i ended up going with the list of un recognized nations to which i added taiwan which gave me a total of one hundred and ninety six countries and after i 'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about roughly four books a week around working five days a week had to face up to the fact that i might even not be able to get books in english from every country only around four point five percent of the literary works published each year in the uk are translations four point five percent is tiny enough to start with but what that figure doesn 't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles to english language publishers so for example although well over one hundred books are translated from french and published in the uk each year most of them will come from countries like france or switzerland french speaking africa on the other hand will rarely ever get a look in the upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in english their books remain invisible to readers of the world 's most published but when it came to reading the world the biggest challenge of all for me was that fact that having spent my life reading almost exclusively british and north american books i wouldn 't know a good novel from namibia there was no hiding it i was a clueless i registered my blog i explained who i was how narrow my reading had been and i asked anyone who cared to to leave a message suggesting what i might read from other parts of the planet people started to get in touch at first it was friends and colleagues then it was friends of friends and pretty soon it was strangers i got a message from a woman called rafidah in kuala lumpur but two books at the time i was amazed that a stranger more than six thousand miles away some took on research on my behalf if you want to encounter it with an open mind the world will help you people went further still books often came from surprising sources my panamanian read for example came through a conversation i had with the panama canal on twitter it suggested that i might like to try and get hold of the work of the panamanian author juan david morgan i found morgan 's website and i sent him a message if any of his spanish language novels had been translated into english and he said that nothing had been published but he did have an unpublished translation of his novel the golden horse allowing me to become one of the first people ever to read that book in english morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way from sweden to palau writers and translators sent me self published books and unpublished manuscripts of books that hadn 't been picked up by anglophone publishers or that were no longer available giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds i read for example about the southern african i met kuwait 's answer to bridget jones and i read about an orgy in a tree in angola came towards the end of my quest when i tried to get hold of a book from the tiny african island nation of so having spent several months trying everything i could think of to find a book that had been translated into english from the nation it seemed as though the only option left to me was to see if i could get something now i was really dubious whether anyone was going to want to help with this and give up their time for something like that including a leader in her field who has translated the work of nobel prize winner jos they all took on a couple of short stories from this collection stuck to their word sent their translations back to me six weeks i had the entire book to read my not knowing and being open about my limitations had become a big opportunity when it came to so it was a chance not only to learn something new and discover a new collection of stories but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor my weakness had become the project 's strength the books i read that year opened my eyes to many things as those who enjoy reading will know books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself and into someone else 's mindset so that for a while at least you look at world through different eyes when i looked back at much of the and as the pages turned something else started to happen too academic register of place names i don 't want to suggest that it 's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book but cumulatively the stories i read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness diversity and complexity it was as though the world 's stories and the people who 'd gone to such lengths to help me read them these days when i look at my bookshelves or consider the works on my e reader they tell a rather different story it 's the story of the power books have to connect us across political and it 's testament to the extraordinary times we live in it 's easier than ever before for a stranger to share a story a worldview a book with someone she may never if we all read more widely there 'd be more incentive for publishers to translate more books and we would all be richer for that"
