  "transcript": "so here 's the good news about families the last fifty years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family but through it all the family has grown stronger eight in ten say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in now here 's the bad news nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life feels like we 're constantly playing defense just when our kids stop they start having tantrums just when they stop needing our help taking a bath they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying ellen galinsky of the families and work institute asked one thousand children if you were granted one wish about your parents what would it be spending more time with them the kids ' number one wish i spent the last few years trying to answer that question traveling around meeting families talking to scholars experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to warren buffett 's bankers to the green berets i was trying to figure out what do happy families do right and what can i learn from them to make my family happier i want to tell you about one family that i met and why i think they offer clues at seven p m on a sunday in hidden springs idaho the family meeting the starrs are a regular american family with their share of regular american family problems eleanor takes care of their four children ages ten to fifteen one of those kids tutors math on the far side of town one has lacrosse on the near side of town one has asperger syndrome one has adhd what the starrs did next though was surprising instead of turning to friends or relatives they looked to david 's workplace cutting edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in japan to startups in silicon valley so instead of having executives issue grand proclamations you have constant feedback you have daily update sessions you have weekly reviews you 're constantly changing and made everybody happier to be part of the family when my wife and i adopted these family meetings and other techniques and these meetings had this effect while taking under twenty minutes so what is agile and why why can it help with something that seems so different like families in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three jeff sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in new england he was very frustrated with how software got designed and no one had ever consulted the programmers eighty three percent of projects failed they were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn 't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time he read thirty years of harvard business review before stumbling upon an article in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six called the new new product development game it said that the pace of business was quickening and by the way this was in one thousand nine hundred it highlighted toyota and canon and likened their adaptable as sutherland told me we got to that article and said that 's it so instead of saying you guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network you say you go off and come up with one element then bring it back let 's talk about it let 's adapt fail quickly inevitably people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families you had blogs pop up and some manuals were written even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving where you had one one group of people working on the food one setting the table and one greeting visitors at the door sutherland said it was the best thanksgiving ever and talk about how agile can help so the starrs in adapting this to their home created a morning checklist poured herself a cup of coffee sat in a reclining chair checked the list again rechecked the list fed the pets or whatever chores they had checked the list once more gathered their belongings and made their way to the bus family dynamics i have ever seen eleanor looked at me that 's what i thought she said i told david ' keep your work out of my kitchen ' but i was wrong so i turned to david so why does it work he said you can 't underestimate the power of doing this and he made a checkmark he said in the workplace adults love it with kids it 's heaven it cut parental screaming in half what didn 't work well and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on what didn 't work well our math sheets or greeting visitors at the door like a lot of parents our kids are something like bermuda triangles like thoughts and ideas go in but none ever comes out i mean at least not that are revealing this gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts but the most surprising part was when we turned to what are we going to work on in the week ahead you know the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids our kids love this process so they would come up with all these ideas you know greet five visitors at the door this week get an extra ten minutes of reading before bed it turns out by the way but the truth is it didn 't really bother us it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn 't light up their world for many years to come three years later our girls are almost eight now we 're still holding these meetings my wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom adapt all the time when i became a parent i figured you know what we 'll set a few rules and we 'll stick to them we can 't it 's like they say in the internet world if you 're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago you 're doing the wrong thing parents can learn a lot but to me adapt all the time means something deeper too we have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self help gurus or other family experts the truth is their ideas are stale whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids but for so many of us it doesn 't work in our lives i 'm not home can 't make family dinner we 'll have family breakfast we 'll meet for a bedtime snack we 'll make sunday meals more important and the truth is recent research backs it turns out there 's only ten minutes of productive time in any family meal the rest of it 's taken up with take your elbows off the table and pass the ketchup you can take that ten minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit so time shift family dinner that 's adaptability an environmental psychologist if you 're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface you 'll be more rigid if you 're sitting on a cushioned chair you 'll be more open she told me when you 're discipling your children sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface the conversation will go better my wife and i actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because i was sitting above in the power position the point is there are all these new ideas out there we 've got to hook them up with adapt all the time be flexible be open minded let the best ideas win empower your children it 's easier and frankly we 're usually right there 's a reason that few systems have been more waterfall enlist the children in their own upbringing just yesterday we were having our family meeting and we had voted to work on overreacting so we kind of liked that but then her sister started working the system she said do i get one or can i get ten 30 second overreactions if we get fifteen minutes of overreaction time that 's the limit every minute above that we have to do one pushup so you see this is working now look this system isn 't lax there 's plenty of parental authority going on but we 're giving them practice becoming independent which of course is our ultimate goal just as i was leaving to come here tonight one of my daughters started screaming the other one said overreaction overreaction and started counting and within ten seconds it had ended to me that is a certified agile miracle research backs this up too children who plan their own goals and yes on occasion fail on their own terms i was talking to warren buffett 's banker and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance and i said but what if they drive into a ditch it 's much better to drive into a ditch with a $ six allowance than a plank number three tell your story jim collins the so how do you do that so he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement we did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat we had a pajama i made popcorn actually i burned one so i made two and we ended up with ten statements we like solutions again research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more time focusing worry less about the bad times and build up the good times this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right a few weeks later we got a call from the school one of our daughters had gotten into a spat and suddenly we were worried like do we have a mean girl on our hands and we didn 't really know what to do so we called her into my the family mission statement was on the wall and my wife said so anything up there seem to apply and she kind of looked down the list and she said bring people together suddenly we had a way into the conversation another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from researchers at emory gave children a simple what do you know test do you know where your grandparents were born do you know where your parents went to high school do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation an illness and they overcame it the children who scored highest on this do you know scale had the highest self esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives the do you know test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness as the author of the study told me children who have a sense of they 're part of a larger narrative have greater spend time retelling the story of your family 's positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones if you give children this happy narrative you give them the tools to make themselves i was a teenager each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way when i first read that i thought that sentence is inane of course all happy families aren 't alike recent scholarship has allowed us for the first time to identify the building blocks that successful families have i 've mentioned just three adapt all the time tell your story the answer i believe is yes which he had hidden in a ravine if the stick were ever found all humankind would be happy but he never found it in fact he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden covered in a layer of green grass that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned happiness is not something we find it 's something we make almost anybody who 's looked at well run organizations you don 't need some grand plan keep reaching for that green stick in the end this may be the greatest lesson of all what 's the secret to a happy family"
