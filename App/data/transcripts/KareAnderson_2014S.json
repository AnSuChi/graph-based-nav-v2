  "transcript": "because when we are treated that way we feel invisible sometimes or talked around and at i noticed that some people really wanted attention and and yet there are other people i observed who had what i called a mutuality mindset in each situation they found a way to talk about us so my idea to reimagine the world is to see it one where we all become greater there 's no greater opportunity or call for action for us now than to become and i want to talk to you about that even more than giving is the capacity for us to do something smarter together for the greater good that lifts us both up and that can scale that 's why i 'm sitting here but i also want to point something else out each one of you is better than anybody else at something that disproves that popular notion that if you 're the smartest person in the room you 're in the wrong room laughter so let me tell you about a hollywood party i went to a couple years back and and she had the fervent belief that every new building in los angeles should have public art in it she wanted a regulation for it and she fervently started who is here from chicago bean shaped reflective sculptures in millennium and people would walk up to it and they 'd smile in the reflection of it and they 'd pose and they 'd vamp and they 'd take selfies together he 's getting out of san quentin in a couple of weeks and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect he spent five years and i met him because i gave a speech at san quentin and he 's articulate and he 's rather easy on the eyes because he 's buff he had workout regime he did every day i said he 'd be an unexpected ally and not just that there 's james he 's an architect mini plazas and those urban walkways and indeed they were they met together they spoke in front of the los angeles city council and the council members not only passed the regulation half of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards compelling and credible you can 't buy that what i 'm asking you to consider is what kind of opportunity makers we might become because more than wealth or fancy titles or and i 'm not saying this is easy and i 'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too about who you wanted to connect with but what i want to suggest is this is an opportunity i started thinking about it way back when i was a wall street journal reporter and i was in europe and i was supposed to cover trends and trends that transcended so i had to have contacts in different worlds very different than mine because otherwise you couldn 't spot the trends and third i had to write the story in a way stepping into the reader 's shoes so they could see how these trends could affect their lives do and here 's a strange thing unlike an increasing number of americans who are working and living and playing with people who think exactly like them because we then become more rigid and extreme are actively seeking situations with people unlike them and they 're building relationships and because they do that they 're not affronted they 're fascinated by them and that is a huge shift in mindset and once you feel it you want it to happen a lot more this world is calling out for us to have a collective because things can be devised like drones and drugs and data collection and they can devised by more people and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes and then as we know from the news every day they can be used for dangerous ones it calls on us each of us to a higher calling but here 's the icing on the cake it 's not just the first opportunity that you do with somebody else that 's probably your greatest as an institution or an individual it 's after you 've had that experience and you trust each other marty and he watched them when they were practicing and he was soon talking to wally my friend and he thought i have a set of racquetball courts that guy could teach it a lot of people who work there are members at my courts they 're frequent travelers they could practice in their hotel room no equipment provided that 's how wally got hired not only that years later he was also teaching years after that he was teaching the racquetball teachers what i 'm suggesting is when you connect with people around a shared interest and action and i think that 's what we 're looking at and in this room are key players in technology key players who are uniquely so here 's what i 'm calling for you to do remember the three traits of keep honing their top strength they get involved in different worlds than their worlds so they 're trusted and they and they communicate to connect around sweet spots of shared interest so what i 'm asking you is the world is hungry i truly believe in my firsthand experience the world is hungry for us to unite together as and to emulate those behaviors as so many of you already do i know that firsthand and to reimagine a world where we use our best talents together more often to accomplish greater things together than we could on our own as dave liniger once said you can 't succeed coming to the potluck with only a fork"
