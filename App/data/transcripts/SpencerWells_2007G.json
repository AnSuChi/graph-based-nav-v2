  "transcript": "these are a few of the languages that i 've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six as i 've been to seventeen countries i think i 'm up to on this crazy tour i 've been doing checking out various aspects of the project that we 're doing and i 'm going to tell you a little bit about later on and visiting some pretty incredible places and the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing for lots of reasons you see some incredible stuff and the thing that you really take away from that the kind of surface thing that you take away from it is not that we 're all one although i 'm going to tell you about that six thousand different languages spoken by six and a half billion people all different colors shapes sizes you that 's what i 'm going to talk about today is how we 're using the tools of genetics population genetics in particular to tell us how we generated this diversity and how long it took now the problem of human diversity like all big scientific questions how do you explain something like that can be broken down into sub questions and you can ferret away at those little sub questions and the second question is related but slightly different if we do spring from a common source how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe and in the process generate all of this diversity the different ways of life the different appearances the different languages around the world well the question of origins as with so many other questions in biology seems to have been answered by darwin over a century ago in the descent of man he wrote in each great region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region and as these two species are now man 's nearest allies it 's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere so we 're done we can go home finished the origin question well not quite because darwin was talking about our distant ancestry and it is quite clear that apes originated on the african continent around twenty three million years ago they appear in the fossil record africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time due to the vagaries of plate tectonics floating around the indian ocean bumped into eurasia around sixteen million years ago and then we had the first african exodus as we call it the apes that left at that time ended up in southeast asia became the gibbons and the orangutans and the ones that stayed on in africa evolved into the gorillas the chimpanzees and us so yes but that 's not really the question i 'm asking i 'm asking about our human ancestry things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room if you wouldn 't leap back like that what about our human ancestry because if we go far enough back we share a common ancestry with every living thing on earth dna ties us all together so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria if you go far enough back over a billion years and largely on the basis of morphology the way things are shaped often skull shape saying this looks a little bit more like us than that so this must be my ancestor this must be who i 'm directly descended from the field of paleoanthropology i 'll argue gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry but it doesn 't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists what do i mean by that you 're looking at a great example here these are three extinct species of hominids potential human ancestors all dug up just west of here in olduvai gorge by the leakey family and they 're all dating to roughly the same time from left to right we 've got homo erectus homo habilis and australopithecus now called paranthropus boisei the robust australopithecine three extinct species same place same time that means that not all three could be my direct ancestor which one of these guys am i actually related to a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently again largely skull shape the first person to do this systematically carl von linne a swedish botanist who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to and he did a pretty good job he categorized about twelve thousand species in but looking around the world at the diversity of humans he said well you know we seem to come in discreet sub species or categories and he talked about africans and americans and asians and europeans and a blatantly racist category he termed monstrosus which basically included all the people he didn 't like including imaginary folk like elves it 's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre darwinian era except if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as twenty or thirty years ago in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity human races is the best example but based on what data what i 'm going to talk about today what i 'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry digging things up out of the ground possible ancestors and saying on the basis of morphology which we still don 't completely understand we don 't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation what we need to do is turn the problem on its head because what we 're really asking is a genealogical problem or a genealogical question what we 're trying to do is construct a family and as any genealogist will tell you anybody have a member of the family or maybe you have tried to a family tree trace back in time you start in the present with relationships you 're certain about you and your siblings you have a parent in common you and you hit what the genealogists call a a point beyond which you don 't know anything else about your ancestors and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history actually we do and that 's what we study now a quick primer on dna i suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist it 's composed of four subunits a c g and t we call them and it 's the sequence of those subunits that that defines that blueprint a haploid genome we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes a haploid genome is around three point two billion nucleotides in length it would reach from here to the moon and back thousands of times it and so when you 're copying this dna molecule to pass it on it 's a pretty tough job imagine the longest book you can think of war and peace now multiply it by one hundred and you 're working away until late at night and you 're very very careful and you 're drinking coffee and you 're paying attention but occasionally a spelling mistake substitute an i for an e or a c for a t same thing happens to our dna as it 's being passed on through the generations it doesn 't happen very often we have a proofreading mechanism built in but when it does happen and these changes get transmitted down through the generations they become markers of descent if you share a marker with someone it and it 's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation the pattern these markers in people all over the world and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history that we 've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today these are two pieces of dna that we use quite widely in our work mitochondrial dna tracing a purely maternal line of descent you get your mtdna from your mother and your mother 's mother they 're still kind of complicated so let 's simplify them turn them on their sides combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within africa now how recently do we share this which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world a single person mitochondrial eve you might have heard about her but what 's even more amazing is that if you look at the the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense that tells us we were all still living in africa at that time this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome why didn 't we start to leave earlier why didn 't why was it that we we seem to have come out of africa so recently in genetics and the study of history in general are always the big ones the ones that are tough to answer and so when all else fails talk about the weather it went up and down and it really started to accelerate around seventy thousand years ago lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types oxygen isotopes and but basically from seventy thousand years on things were getting really tough getting very cold the northern hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets chicago seattle all under a sheet of ice most of britain all of scandinavia covered by ice several kilometers thick now africa is the most tropical continent on the planet about eighty five percent of it lies between cancer and capricorn rather africa was drying out at that time this is a the reason for that is that ice actually it gets so little precipitation the evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time roughly seventy thousand and then something happened a the ones on the right were made by neanderthals our distant cousins not our direct now at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience basically there 's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups the ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right we are in a period of long the tool styles don 't change that much the evidence is that the human way of life didn 't change that much during that period the population size started to expand we became much more social the social networks expanded and they allowed us to start to expand you want the ultimate african success story look in the mirror you 're it the reason you 're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa probably somewhere in the region where we 're sitting right now around sixty seventy thousand years ago reaching australia very rapidly by fifty thousand years ago a so those of you who are going on one of the post conference tours you 'll get to see what a real savannah is like and it 's basically a meat locker people during the rare wet phases in the sahara following the grasslands because that 's what they were adapted to live on entering europe around thirty five thousand years ago and finally a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable siberia inside the arctic circle during the last ice age temperature was at minus seventy minus eighty even minus one hundred perhaps migrating into the americas ultimately reaching that final frontier an amazing and it happened first in africa the changes that allowed us to do that the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us allowing us to create novel cultures allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i 've just been on and that 's the story that i told a couple of years ago in my book the journey of man and a film that we made with the same title and as we were finishing up that film it was co produced with national geographic i started talking to the folks at they liked the film but they said you know we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins where we all came from using the tools of dna to map the migrations around the world you know the study of human origins is kind of in our dna and we want to take it to the next level what do you want to do next which is a great question to be asked by national geographic and it 's based on a few thousand people we 've sampled from you know a handful of populations around the world studied a a few genetic markers and there are lots of gaps on this map we 've just connected the dots what we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more hundreds of thousands of dna samples from people all over the world and that was the genesis of the genographic project science is a big part of it the field research that we 're doing around the world with indigenous peoples people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live so my ancestors come from all over northern europe i live in the eastern seaboard of north america when i 'm not traveling where am i indigenous to nowhere really my genes are all jumbled up but there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the dna results that 's the focus of the field research the centers that we 've set up all over the world ten of them top population geneticists how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project the human genome project or a mars rover mission in this case you actually can you can go onto our website and you can actually submit those results to the database and tell us a little about your genealogical background have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort now this is all a and so the money that we raise after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components gets plowed back into the project the majority going to something we call the legacy fund it so how are we doing on the which has raised around five million dollars we 've just awarded the first legacy grants totaling around five hundred thousand dollars and i urge you to check out the website and watch this space"
