  "transcript": "and why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex contrary to popular belief or the next question would be can we want what we already have that 's the million dollar question right and why does sex make babies and babies spell erotic disaster in couples it and when you love how does it feel and when you desire how is it different these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire a crisis of desire as in owning the wanting desire as an expression of our individuality of our free choice of our preferences of our identity desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies you know this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term fourteen children for which we need to have even more because many of them won 't make it and not because it is exclusively a woman 's marital duty this is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire sustaining desire in a committed relationship i think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs on the one hand our need for security for permanence all these anchoring grounding experiences of our lives that we call for danger for the unknown for the unexpected surprise you get the gist passionate marriage used to be a contradiction in terms marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship but now we want our partner to still give us all these things but in addition i want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot and we live twice as long give me identity give me continuity but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one give me comfort give me edge give me novelty give me familiarity give me predictability give me surprise and we think it 's a given and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that so now we get to the existential reality of the story right because i think in some way and i 'll come back to that but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination so it is to want we want to forgone conclusion does not keep our interest in desire we want an other somebody on the other side that we can go visit that we can go spend some time with that we can go or in other words i sometimes say fire needs air desire needs space and when it 's said like that it 's often quite abstract but then i took a question with me and i 've gone to more than twenty countries in the last few years with and across culture across religion and across gender except for one there are a few answers that just keep coming back so the first group is i am most drawn to my partner when we reunite and when but then the second group is even more interesting when he is in his element when she 's doing something she 's passionate about when i see her hold court i look at this person by the way in desire people rarely talk about it when we are blended into one five centimeters from each other i don 't know in inches how much that is it 's when i 'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance so known is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious somewhat elusive doing something in which they are enveloped and i stay open in this description about the other caretaking i have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them wanting them is one thing needing them is a shot down and women have known that forever because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge and then the third group of answers usually would be when when we laugh together but novelty isn 't about new positions it isn 't a repertoire of techniques novelty is what parts of you do you bring out what parts of you are just being seen because in some way one could say sex isn 't something you do sex is a place you go what parts of you do you connect to what do you seek to express there is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take it isn 't just a behavior and it 's the poetic of that language that i 'm interested in which is why i began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence you know which means that it 's sexuality transformed by the human imagination we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation which is a mortar to desire the ability to imagine it as if it 's happening to experience it as if it 's happening while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time and if i look at it as an intelligence then it 's something that you for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark i had to go back to the original definition of eroticism the mystical and i went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma looking at the community that i had grown up in which was a community in belgium all holocaust survivors could not trust because when you 're vigilant and when i began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that i work with i sometimes would hear people say i want more sex and so i began to ask a different question i shut myself off when began to be the question i turn off my desires when which is not the same question as what turns me off is and you turn me off when when i haven 't had time for myself when i haven when i don 't perform well at work when i feel low self esteem when i don 't when i don 't feel like i have a right to want to take to receive pleasure now if you are dead inside the other person can do a lot of things for valentine 's it won 't make a dent there is nobody at the reception i turn myself on when i turn on my desires i wake up when what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love responsibility for the other are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such basically most of us you know the erotic mind is not very politically correct if everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses we wouldn 't be having such interesting talks about this but no in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don 't always know how to bring to the person that we love because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word so i want to draw that little image for you because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs we are born with that our need for connection our need and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and at some point all of us need to go out into the world and then at some point they turn around and they look at you and if you tell them hey kiddo the world 's a great place go for it there 's so much fun out there then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time they can go off in their imagination off in their body off in their playfulness all the while knowing that there 's somebody when they come back i 'm anxious i 'm depressed my partner hasn 't taken care of me in so long what 's so good out there don 't we have everything you need together you and i are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize some of us will come back came back a long time ago and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other i will lose my freedom in order not to lose translate this it continues into our sex lives are you going to be there are you going to curse me scold me are you going to be angry with me the growing intimacy wasn 't yet so strong that it actually led it 's that real dialectic piece on the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go on the other hand if you can 't go you can 't have pleasure you you don 't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own so in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs there are a few things that i 've come to understand erotic couples do one they have a lot of they understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them they also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm they also understand that an erotic space isn 't about you begin to stroke the other it 's about you create a space where you leave management inc maybe where you leave the where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible responsibility and desire just butt heads they don 't really do well together which is that it 's just going to fall from heaven while you 're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long term relationship already has committed sex is premeditated does good sex"
