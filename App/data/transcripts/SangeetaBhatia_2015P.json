i 'm inspired by this miniaturization revolution in computers as a physician i wonder whether we could use it to reduce the number of lives lost due to one of the and we are but it turns out that there but even with the best tools and technologies that we have today tumors can 't be detected until ten years after they 've started growing when they are fifty million cancer cells strong what if we had better technologies to detect some of these more deadly cancers sooner when they could be removed when they were just getting started let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there this is a microscope in a typical lab that a pathologist would use for looking at a tissue specimen like a biopsy or a pap smear this $ seven thousand microscope would be used by somebody with years of specialized training to spot cancer cells rebecca richards kortum what she and her team have done is miniaturize that whole microscope into this $ ten now what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient and sending it to the microscope you can bring the microscope to the patient and then instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images you can train the computer to score normal because what they found working in rural communities is that even when they have a mobile screening van that can go out into the community and perform exams and collect samples and send them to the central hospital for analysis because they can 't afford the trip with the integrated microscope and computer analysis rebecca and her colleagues have been able to create a van that has both a diagnostic setup and a treatment setup and what that means is that they can do a diagnosis and perform therapy on the spot so no one is lost to follow up now as engineers we think of this as straight up miniaturization you took a big thing and you made it little find the tumor all by itself and send a signal to the outside world nanotechnology allows us to do just that which is one hundred microns to a thousand times smaller and that has profound implications it turns out that materials actually change their properties at the nanoscale and you grind it into dust into gold nanoparticles and it changes from looking gold to looking red if you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide forms a big black crystal if you make nanocrystals out of this material and and you shine light on it depending only on their size it 's wild can you imagine an object like that in the macro world it would be like all the denim jeans in your closet but they are different colors colors depending only on their size so as a physician what 's just as interesting to me is that it 's not just the color of materials that changes at the nanoscale the way they travel in your body also changes so let me show you what i mean surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor we now it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky and so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor whether they leak out depends on their so in this image the smaller hundred nanometer blue nanoparticles are leaking out and the larger depending on how big or small i make a material i can change where it goes in your body in my lab we recently made cancer nanodetector that is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors we designed it to listen for tumor invasion the orchestra of chemical signals that tumors need to make to spread for a tumor to break out of the tissue that it 's born in it has to make chemicals called enzymes to chew through the scaffolding of tissues we designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes now in engineering we call that ratio a form of amplification and it makes something ultrasensitive so but how do i get this activated signal to the outside world where i can act on it and that has to do with the kidney the kidney is a filter its job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine it turns out that what the kidney filters is also dependent on size so if i make 100 nanometer cancer detector i inject it in the bloodstream it can leak into the tumor where it 's activated by tumor enzymes to release a small signal that is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney and put into the urine ok but there 's one more problem this is a tiny little signal so how do i detect it well the signal is just a and we can design them so they are compatible with our tool of choice fancy instrument called a mass spectrometer then we make a molecule with a unique mass then we make molecules that we can trap on paper like a pregnancy test in fact there 's a whole world of paper tests that are becoming available in a field called paper diagnostics alright where are we going with this but i think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward even and maybe especially cancer researchers i 'm going to tell you what i hope will happen with my technology that my team and i will i dream instead of going into an expensive screening facility or a pap smear that you could get a shot i imagine or a medical professional in the room now i know this sounds like a dream but in the lab we already have this working in mice where it works better than colon and ovarian cancer and i hope that what this means is that one day we can detect tumors in patients sooner than ten years after they 've started growing and that we could save more lives with early detection thank you"
