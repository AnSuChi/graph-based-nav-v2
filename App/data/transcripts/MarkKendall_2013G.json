  "transcript": "less than a mile from here in this direction and it was at the royal college of physicians this is the patent so we turn to the field of vaccines most vaccines are delivered with the needle and after clean water and sanitation vaccines are the one technology that has increased but just like any other technology vaccines have and that 's problematic in terms of the rollout and the who has figures that suggest about one point three million deaths per year take place due to now these are two things that you probably may have heard of but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you may not have heard about one is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses and the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that i 'll tell you about i 'm going to tell you about some work that my team and i are doing in australia at the university of queensland and that this is a specimen of the nanopatch to the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp but under a microscope what you see and there 's about four thousand projections on this particular square compared to to the needle and i 've designed those projections to serve a key role which is to work with the skin 's immune system so that 's a very important function tied in with the nanopatch now we make with a technique called deep and therefore is low cost and can be rolled out in large numbers now we dry coat vaccines to the projections now the simplest form of application but our finger has some limitations so we 've devised an applicator and it 's a very simple device you could call it a sophisticated finger it 's a spring operated device what we do is when we apply the nanopatch to the skin as so so firstly the projections on the nanopatch breach through the tough so that gives you an idea of the nanopatch and immediately you can see some key advantages we 've talked about it being needle free now if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages one and the second is getting rid of so let 's start with the first one this immunogenicity idea it takes a little while to get our heads around but i 'll try to explain it in simple terms so i 'll so vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ now that safe germ that antigen tricks our body into mounting an immune response learning and remembering how to deal with intruders when the real intruder comes along so it does that well the way it 's done today with the needle and syringe most vaccines are delivered that way with this old technology and the needle but it could be argued that the needle is holding back to describe this idea starting with one of those projections and applying the to the skin this is real data that thing that we can see there is one projection from the nanopatch that 's been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers now to give you an idea of scale if the needle was shown here it would be too big it would be ten times bigger than the size of that screen going ten times deeper as well it 's off the grid entirely as one example in the brown layer there 's a certain type of cell called a langerhans cell every square millimeter of our body is jammed but you can immediately see that the that penetration indeed we target but so what so what if you 've targeted cells in the world of vaccines what does that mean the world of vaccines is getting better we nanopatches to the skin and we waited and this is in the live animal we waited and this is what we found out this is a data slide showing the immune responses that we 've generated with a nanopatch compared to so on the horizontal axis we have the dose shown in nanograms on the vertical axis we have the immune response generated and that that dashed line indicates the protection threshold if we 're above that line it if we 're below that line it 's not but notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue line that 's what 's achieved with the nanopatch the delivered dose of the nanopatch is a completely different where we can take a vaccine that works but is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose compared to the needle that currently don 't work tuberculosis they 're responsible for about seven million deaths per year and there is no adequate vaccination method for any of those so potentially with this new lever we can help we can push that lever to help get those candidate vaccines over the line now of course we 've worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves to this what we 've achieved with influenza i 'd like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today 's vaccines and that is the need to maintain the cold chain as the name suggests the cold chain requirements of keeping a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied to keep it refrigerated now that presents some logistical challenges but we have ways to do it this is a slightly extreme case in point but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges to get vaccines refrigerated and maintain the cold chain if the vaccine is too too warm the stakes are very high the who estimates that within africa up to half the vaccines used there are considered to not be working properly because at some point the cold chain has fallen so it 's a big problem and it 's tied in with the needle and syringe because it 's a liquid form vaccine and when it 's liquid it needs the refrigeration and when it 's dry it doesn 't need refrigeration within my lab we 've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at twenty three degrees celsius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all that 's an important improvement we 're delighted about it as well as an engineer and we 've commenced this journey in an unusual way we 've started with now papua new guinea is but it suffers from many of the key barriers existing within the world of today 's vaccines many of them are breaking down and many are not in the highlands where but also papua new guinea has the world 's highest incidence of hpv human papillomavirus the cervical cancer [ risk factor ] so for those two reasons with the attributes of the nanopatch we 've got into the taken it to papua new guinea and we 'll be following that up shortly the birthplace of the needle and syringe"
