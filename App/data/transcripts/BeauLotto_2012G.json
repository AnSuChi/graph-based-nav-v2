  "transcript": "so i 'm going to count to you so we don 't all do it it literally says the brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it which means we never see what 's there we never see information we only ever see what was useful to see in the past all right which means when it comes to perception we 're all like this frog and perception underpins everything we think we know we believe our hopes our dreams the clothes we wear falling in love everything begins with perception now if perception is grounded in our history it means we 're only ever responding according to what we 've done before but actually it 's a tremendous problem and all new perceptions begin in the same way they begin with a question the problem with questions is they create uncertainty now uncertainty is a very bad thing it 's evolutionarily a bad thing if you 're not sure that 's a predator it 's too late even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty right your inner ears are you telling you you 're moving your eyes because it 's moving in register with the boat say i 'm standing still your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information and it gets ill the question why is one of the most dangerous things you can do because it takes you and it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions the best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty they 're the ones that question the things we but to question what you think to be true already so what is evolution 's answer now play is not simply a process experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated uncertainty is what makes and it 's cooperative it 's actually how we do our social bonding and it 's intrinsically motivated what that means is that we play to play play is its own reward now if you look at these five ways of being these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist is not defined by the method section of a paper it 's actually a way of being which is here and this is true for anything that is creative so if you add rules to play you have a game that 's actually what an experiment is so armed with these two ideas that science is a way of being but through the process of science to see themselves differently i should say that we didn 't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn 't make a useful contribution to science and the teachers said kids couldn 't do it so we did it anyway right so here are some of the questions i put them in small print so you wouldn 't bother reading it point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with so they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists she will now once she comes onto stage will be the youngest person to ever speak at ted now she is the personification of courage because she 's going to stand up here and talk to you all so amy would you please come up and first she 's going to but we wondered if there 's a possible link so we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way really we wanted to know if bees so what if bees can think like us well it but it actually makes a lot of sense they should because bees like us can recognize a good flower so the kids went off and they designed this experiment and so well game and so amy can you tell us what the game was and the puzzle that you set the bees ao the puzzle we came up with was to a certain color flower only when it 's in a certain pattern the interesting question is which what was really exciting about this project was we and beau had no idea whether it would work completely new and no one had done it before including adults bl and that was really hard for the teachers it 's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he 's doing because that 's what we do in the lab but for a teacher not to know what 's going to happen at the end of the day so much of the credit goes to dave strudwick who was the collaborator on so here are some of the students doing the observations they 're recording the data of where the bees fly so we 've got our observations we 've got our data they do the simple so we have to write it up so we go of course to the pub okay what 's the question and why methods what did you do results what was the that 's a science paper basically which means that this paper is written in kidspeak it 's not written by me it 's written by amy and the other students in the class as a consequence this science paper begins once upon a time the results section it says training phase the puzzle duh duh duuuuuhhh right and the methods it says then we put the bees we have a number of authors there all the ones in bold are eight to ten years old the first author is blackawton primary school because if it were ever referenced it would be blackawton et al and it says this it said many things but it said this i 'm afraid the and he says this is the most original science paper i have ever read and it certainly deserves wide exposure larry maloney expert in vision says the paper is magnificent the work would be publishable if done by adults putting in the references and it was published two years to get it published so this makes amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world what was the feedback like it was published two days before right it 's forever freely accessible by biology letters it 's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal and i 'll just read curiosity interest innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science who else can have these qualities more than children please congratulate your children 's team from my side right because we 've only done this once before and you have to point where you hear me clapping one more time everyone over there shout where 's the sound coming from it offers the possibility to step on uncertainty true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice so i 've asked amy to be the last voice in this short story so amy ao this project was really exciting for me because it brought the process of discovery to life and it showed me that anyone and i mean anyone has the potential to discover something new and that a small question can lead into a big changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy but changing the way i thought about science was and that anyone can discover something new you just need an opportunity"
