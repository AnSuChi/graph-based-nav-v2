  "transcript": "a word often enough it becomes you and having grown up in a segregated city baltimore maryland i sort of use that idea to go around america with a tape recorder thank god for technology to interview people thinking that if i walked in their words which is also why i don 't wear shoes when i perform if i walked in their words that i could sort of absorb america i was also inspired by walt whitman who wanted to absorb america and have it absorb him so these four characters are going to be from that work that i 've been doing for many years now and well over i don 't know a so i thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in american history you know he was born in one thousand nine hundred and twelve the year the titanic sank greatest ship every built hits the tip of an iceberg some century laughter so this is his answer about a defining moment in american history defining moment in american history i don 't think there 's one you can 't say hiroshima that 's a big one i can 't think of any one moment i would say is a defining moment the gradual slippage ' slippage ' is the word used by the people in watergate moral slippage it 's a gradual kind of thing combination of things you see and they should leave the gate there these trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination you see in the old days we had robots lincoln concourse two dallas fort worth same voice without losing a beat says ' because of late entry ' just then everybody 's looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple 's going like this you know shrinking well i 'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before your time has come silence and so suddenly they 're looking at me so here i am with the couple the three of us shrinking at the foot of calvary about to be up you know just then i see a baby a little baby in the lap of a mother so i say to the baby i say to the baby ' sir or madam what is your considered opinion starts busting out with this crazy little laugh i say ' thank god for a remember that great scene on the raft remember what huck did you see here 's huck he 's an illiterate 's had no schooling but there 's something in him and huck gets on the raft with a property named jim a slave and he hears that jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman woman who owns them and huck slavers caught up guys chasing slaves looking for jim ' anybody up on that raft with so you ask about a defining moment ain 't no defining moment in american history for me it 's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now where trivia becomes news and more and more less and less awareness of the pain i don 't know if you could use this or not but i was quoting wright morris a writer from nebraska who says ' we 're more and more into communications and less and less into communication ' okay kids i got to scram got i 'm going to do somebody that nobody likes you know most actors want to do characters that that are likeable well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this i like to inspire people but since this was called risk taking i 'm doing somebody who i never do because she 's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in but there are certain other connotations to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature what is nature maxine greene who 's a wonderful philosopher who 's as old as studs and was the head of a philosophy great big philosophy kind of an organization i went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn 't and i still feel as though i 've got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though i 've outlived most of them i don 't know enough about the negative imagination and september certainly taught us that that 's a whole area we don 't investigate so this piece is about a negative imagination it raises questions about what nature is what mother nature is and i title things because i think people speak in this is called a mirror to her mouth and this is an inmate named paulette jenkins i began to learn how to cover it up because i didn 't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home but that didn 't make my children pain i ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises i didn 't and i failed them dramatically because i allowed it to go on and on and on but the night that myesha got killed and the intensity just oh he would use a belt he had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that myesha was having sex little brother and they was fondling each other that would be his reason i 'm just talking about the particular night that she died so i had a baby by him insane thinking that if i gave him his own kid he would leave mine alone and it and i ended up with three children houston myesha and dominic who was four months old when i came to jail and i was in the bedroom like i said he had her in the bathroom and he he every time he hit her she would fall and she would hit her head on the tub it happened continuously repeatedly i could hear it but i dared not to move i didn 't move i didn 't even go and see what was happening i just sat there and listened and then he put her in the hallway he told her face was all around her head was just swollen her head was about two sizes of its own size i told him ' let her go to sleep ' he let her go to sleep the next morning she was dead he went in to check i didn 't even want to accept the fact that she was dead so i went in and i put a mirror to her mouth there was no thing nothing i agree i mean i 've been keeping a secret for years and years and years so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret so we went to the mall we told a security guard that she was missing and we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard and we drove out to like i was so petrified and so numb all i could look was right on the shoulder of the highway i let that happen to so that 's an investigation of the negative imagination when i started this project called on the road a search for an american character with my tape recorder i thought that i was going to go around america and find it in all its aspects bull riders cowboys pig farmers drum majorettes but i sort of got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show about a race riot i went to both two race riots one of which was the los angeles riot and this next piece is from that because this is what i would say i 've learned the most about race relations from this piece everybody knows that the los angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named rodney king it was captured on videotape technology and it was played all over the world everybody thought the four cops would go to jail they did not so there were riots sr and that trial came back with two two cops going to jail and two so there was a community that didn 't the korean americans whose stores had been burned to the ground and so this woman mrs young soon han i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race and she asks also a question that studs talks about this notion of the official truth to question the official truth so what she 's questioning here she 's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society and this is called swallowing the bitterness the best i watched in korea many luxurious hollywood lifestyle movie i never saw any poor man any black until one thousand nine hundred and ninety two i used to believe america was the best i still do i don 't deny that because i i began to really realize that koreans are completely left out of this society who never work we didn 't get any because we have a car and i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the day they were having a party they celebrated all of south central all the churches and they say ' well finally justice has been done in this society ' well what about victims ' rights they got their rights by destroying innocent korean merchants he is the model of they destroyed innocent people i was sitting here alone and watching them they became so hilarious but i was happy for them i was glad for them rights for over two centuries and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities hispanic asian we would suffer more in the mainstream that 's why i understand that 's why i have a mixed feeling about the verdict but i wish that i wish that i wish that i could be part i wish that i could live together with black people but after the riot it 's too much difference the fire is still there how do you the other reason that i don 't wear shoes and i told you that in you know i didn 't give you the and he 's the lead in an op ed i did about the republican convention he 's a republican i won 't say anything about my party affiliation but anyway so this is this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do i think there 's a real lesson in this and this is called toughness i 'm an optimist i mean basically i 'm an optimist i mean you know i mean it 's like my wife jolene her family 's always saying you know you ever think he 's just a born loser it seems like he has so much but then when that bull stepped on my kidney you know i didn 't lose my kidney i could have lost my kidney i kept my kidney so i don 't think i 'm a born loser i think that 's good luck and i mean funny things like this happen i was in a i mean like even when i told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me she 's just talking she 's just being nice to you she 's not going to do that ' and then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me and she went and looked you up on the internet she said ' look who she is you 're not even going to be able to answer her questions ' and she was saying you 're going to make me look like an idiot because i 've never been to college and i wouldn 't be talking professional or anything i said ' well look the woman talked to me for four hours you know if i wasn 't talking you me to talk i don 't think she would even come out here ' well i think i ride more out of but determination you know it always said when i was a boy he say ' you know you got more try than any kid i ever seen ' and try and determination is the same thing determination is like you 're going to hang on that bull even if you 're riding upside down determination 's like you 're going to ride till your head hits the back racking up i mean i can 't even imagine what it 's going to be like the last i have my ranch and everything but i actually don 't even want to think the day that comes i mean i guess it just be like i guess it be like the day my brother died we was in west jordan utah and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a you know busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital and they had to sew me up and straighten my nose to put me under anesthesia or whatever you call it and so they sewed my face up and then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head and everybody said that it should have killed me but it didn 't because i guess i have a high tolerance for pain but the good thing was once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose and i hadn 't been able to breathe since i broke my nose in the high school rodeo"
