  "transcript": "it 's a word that denotes opportunity and possibilities open ended open hearth open source open door policy open the internet of today is a platform for computation the internet is becoming a giant global computer and every time you go on it you upload a video you do a google search you remix something now a new generation is opening up the world as well i started studying kids about fifteen and i noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology and at first i thought my children are prodigies but then i noticed all their friends were like them so that was a bad theory so i 've started working with a few hundred kids and i came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age to be bathed in bits i call them the net and and the global economic crisis is opening up the world as well our opaque institutions from the industrial age everything from old models of the corporation government media wall street and this is now creating a burning platform in the world i mean think about wall street the core modus operandi of wall street almost brought down global so this technology push a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new global environment is causing the world to open up now i think in fact we 're at a turning point in human history and for each there 's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization now this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open the guy in the picture here i 'll tell you his story his name is rob mcewen i 'd like to say i have this think tank we scour the world for amazing case studies the reason i know this story is because he 's my neighbor he actually moved across the street from us and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors and he says you 're don tapscott i 've read some of your books i said great what do you do and he says well i used to be a banker and now i 'm a gold miner he takes over this gold mine and his geologists can 't tell him where the gold is he gives them more money for geological data they come back they can 't tell him where to go into production after a few years but he has an epiphany one day he wonders if my geologists don 't know where the gold is maybe somebody else does he takes his geological data he publishes it and he holds a contest on the internet called the goldcorp challenge it 's basically half a million dollars in prize money for anybody who can tell me do i have any gold and if so where is it he gets submissions from all around the world they use techniques that he 's never heard heard of and for his half a million dollars in prize money rob mcewen finds three point four billion dollars worth of gold he 's a happy conventional wisdom says talent is inside right your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night but he didn 't you know some of the best submissions didn 't come from geologists they came from computer scientists engineers and this ideagora that he created an open market agora for uniquely qualified minds was part of a change a profound change in the deep structure and architecture of our organizations and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate to create goods and services to engage with the rest of the world in terms of government how we create public value now secondly openness is about transparency this is different here we 're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations employees customers not just julian assange have these powerful tools for finding out what 's going on scrutinizing informing others and even organizing collective responses and if you 're going to be naked well there 's some corollaries that flow from that i mean one is fitness is no longer optional by buff i mean you need to have good value because value is evidenced like never it 's not bad sunlight is the best disinfectant and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing now this is different than transparency transparency is about the communication of information sharing is about giving up assets intellectual property they took and rather than taking a business model innovation to correspond to that they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you elvis and the beatles is now suing children so we need to think differently about intellectual property i 'll give you an example the pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble first of all there aren 't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline and this is a big problem for human health and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem about to fall off something called the patent cliff do you know about this they 're going to lose twenty to thirty five percent of their revenue in the next twelve months and what are you going to do like cut back on paper clips or something no we need to reinvent the whole model of the pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets in a commons they need to start sharing precompetitive and in doing so create a rising tide that could lift all boats not just for the industry but for humanity now the fourth meaning of openness and corresponding principle is about empowerment and i 'm not talking about the motherhood sense here knowledge and intelligence is power and as it becomes more distributed the open world is bringing freedom the debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled you the new media didn 't cause the revolution it was caused by injustice social media didn 't create the revolution it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and but just as the internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government you know during the tunisian revolution snipers associated with the regime take a picture triangulate the location send that picture to friendly military units who 'd and up until three months ago created an alternative health care system where what they did is they used twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone 's injured it 's not without its problems up until two years ago all revolutions in human history had a leadership and when the old regime fell the leadership and the organization would take power well these wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum and politics abhors a vacuum and unsavory forces can fill that typically the old regime or extremists or fundamentalist forces you can see this playing out today in egypt i think at the end of these four days that you 'll come to conclude that the arc of history is a and it 's towards openness if you go back a few hundred years all around the world it was a very closed society it was agrarian and the means of production and political system was called feudalism and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the and the nobility people didn 't know about things there was no concept of progress you were born you lived your life and you died but then johannes gutenberg came along with his great invention and over time the society opened up people started to learn about things and when they did the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled or frozen so we saw the protestant reformation martin luther called the printing press god 's highest act of grace the the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge the internet gives us access not just to information and knowledge but to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people where the boundaries of our organizations are changing of transparency where sunlight is disinfecting civilization an age of sharing and it 's an age of empowerment what i 'd like to do is to close to share with you some research that i 've been doing i 've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like but bees come in swarms and fish come in schools starlings in the area around edinburgh in the moors of england come in something called a murmuration and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds and throughout the day the starlings are out over a 20 mile radius sort of doing their starling thing and it 's called a murmuration there 's a predator being chased away and apparently this is a frightening thing but there 's no one leader is this some kind of fanciful analogy or could we actually learn something from this the murmuration functions to record a number of principles and they 're basically the principles that i have described to you today it 's an openness and perhaps like we should understand and i get a lot of hope think about the kids today in in the and you see something like this that 's underway and imagine just consider this idea if you would what if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass glass could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge could we start to share our intelligence could we create some kind of collective intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create and i look at this thing and i don 't know i get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller open world that our kids inherit might be a better one and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited let 's do this"
