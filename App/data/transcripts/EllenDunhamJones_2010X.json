  "transcript": "in the last fifty years we 've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences and i 'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that i think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the so whether it 's redeveloping dying malls or i think the fact is the growing number of empty and throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our and in the process instead of continuing i think there are any number of reasons and i 'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few just from the perspective of climate change the average urban dweller in the u s has about mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more and living in detached buildings you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of so strictly from a climate change perspective the big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in it 's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency we 're just driving so much more we haven 't been able to keep up technologically have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles and those have been linked then with the rather alarming growing rates of obesity shown in these maps here and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a developing diabetes and that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore again because of our development patterns and then there 's finally there 's the affordability question i mean how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices suburban expansion to cheap land but increasingly the savings promised by affordability which is basically our model those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs for instance here in atlanta about half and they are spending twenty nine percent of their income on housing and thirty two percent on transportation i mean that 's two thousand and five figures that 's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon you and they 're not going down down any time soon i think it is june williamson and i have been researching this topic for over a decade and we 've found over we all tend to think of suburbia as this very we just haven 't caught up actual realities of this the reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now the baby boomers retiring and then then there 's a gap generation x which is a small generation they 're still having kids but generation y hasn 't even started of new households will not have kids in them consumer research asking the the boomers and gen y what it is they would like what they would like to tells us there is going to be a huge demand and we 're already seeing it for more urban lifestyles within suburbia that basically the boomers want to be able to age in place and gen y would like to live an urban lifestyle but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia the other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt i keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band when the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown but those sites have now it now makes sense to go back in build a deck and build on those sites so what do you do with a dead mall dead office park it turns out all sorts of things in a slow economy like ours re inhabited as art space it 's now home to artist studios theater groups dance troupes it 's not pulling in it 's keeping the lights on it 's becoming i think a really great institution we also found a lot of examples been converted into all sorts of community serving uses as well lots of schools lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one this was a little grocery store a food lion grocery store that is now a public library in addition to i think doing a beautiful adaptive reuse they tore up some of the parking spaces put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff put in a lot more to connect to the neighborhoods and they 've made this what was this one is a little l shaped strip shopping center in phoenix arizona really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint a gourmet grocery and they put up a restaurant in the old post office never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination it 's been so successful they 've now taken over the strip across the street the real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim walking distance to le grande orange because it provided its neighborhood with what and especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family the family households there 's a real hunger for more third places so the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category the next strategy redevelopment now during the boom this is mashpee commons the oldest retrofit that we 've found and it 's just so the black and white photo shows the simple sixty 's strip shopping center and then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact mixed use new england village and it has plans now that have been approved for it to sometimes it 's all at once this one of an office park outside of washington d c when metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert here is the site in one thousand nine hundred and forty it was just a little farm in the village of hyattsville by one thousand nine hundred and eighty it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right i expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to to be redeveloped transit is a big driver of this was a very large mall on a blocks and so it 's really given lakewood colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had they had their prom in the mall they loved their mall the department store has been kept and we found this was true in many cases the department stores are multistory they 're better built they 're easy to be so here it is at projected build out this project i think has great connectivity it 's about two thirds built out right now and it 's helped to prompt but it 's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city no it 's pockets of walkability on the sites of under performing properties but it 's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability you want to also try to get more systemic transformation we need to also retrofit the corridors so this is one that has been retrofitted in california undesirable address to becoming sort of good address i mean now we 're hoping we start to see it they 've already built city hall attracted two hotels but densification is not going to work everywhere there 's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs but perhaps one of the most important re greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology as in this example outside of minneapolis so they 've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy this one in seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot the creek had been culverted under the parking lot but daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat so i 've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits what 's next i think we have three challenges for the future we need to be able to target which areas really should re inhabitation atlanta one hundred years from now and we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves expensive but simple transit on all major rail and road corridors but we 've got a little water problem in a hundred years that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit this is a protest that 's happening on a retrofit in silver spring maryland on an astroturf town green now retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism not without reason you don 't get much more phony than an astroturf town green i have to say these are very hybrid places they are new but trying to look old they have urban streetscapes but suburban parking ratios their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia but they 're less diverse than cities and public places but that are managed by private companies and just the surface appearance are often like the astroturf here they make me wince so you know i mean i 'm glad that the urbanism is doing its job the fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks the streets and blocks the putting in of public space compromised as it may be is still a really great thing but we 've got to get the architecture better the final challenge is for all of you but culturally we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic and we expect that but we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to it 's time to let them grow up the road diets the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you"
