  "transcript": "scene from a movie apocalypse thrilling music in the background this wild music what can we do with i know if you 're good to give a loan to i can look at your medical records i can see if your pump is still pumping see if you 're good to offer insurance to and that 's even before i look at your mail but i 'm not actually here to talk about what we can do now i see some puzzled looks like why are you asking us what 's the right thing just building this stuff somebody else is using it but it brings me back i think about world war ii we gather together these physicists in los alamos to see what they 'll build we want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be so what should we be doing with that guy 's data should so we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good or should we respect his i know crowdsource let 's crowdsource this so to get people warmed up let 's start with let 's do a show of hands iphone think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn 't be such suckers just for the pretty phones next question a little bit harder should we be collecting all of that guy 's data last question harder question when trying to evaluate what we should do in this case should we use a kantian deontological that 's a terrifying result terrifying because we have stronger how do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don 't have a moral framework but what we really need is a moral operating system praise with the good good scold with the bad maybe we take a vote we crowdsource or maybe we punt in other words it 's kind of random kind of ad hoc how we figure out what we should do i know a guy who did exactly that a brilliant guy he remember him old philosopher you were sleeping during that class he wanted to know what is just but he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this i want to know the truth about justice we know the objective facts take a number any number there are truths about two that 's true no matter what thing you 're talking about it 's an objective truth about the form of two the abstract form when you have two of anything two eyes two ears two noses just two protrusions those all partake of the form of two what if there are truths about justice and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated partook of he wants to solve ethics you have a lot of company in the history of western philosophy because the tidy idea aristotle said we should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows he thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here and now using our best judgment to find the right path you think that plato 's not your guy but don 't give up maybe there 's another way what if in any situation you could just calculate that sound familiar john stuart mill was a great advocate of this nice guy besides and only been dead so basis of utilitarianism i 'm sure you 're familiar at least the three people who voted for mill before are familiar with this but what if what makes something moral is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain it 's just a matter of the consequences you just look at the consequences and but i 'm going to take it because i thought that guy looks suspicious and what if he 's been sending little messages to bin laden 's hideout or whoever took over after bin laden and he 's actually like that has a very high utility to prevent that damage and compared to the little pain that it 's going to cause because it 's going to be embarrassing when i 'm looking on his phone and seeing that he has a farmville problem and that whole bit that 's overwhelmed overwhelmed that 's a utilitarian it 's wrong to take his phone because he 's a person and he has rights and he has dignity and we can 't just interfere with that he has autonomy it doesn 't matter what the calculations are there are things that are intrinsically wrong like lying is wrong like torturing kant was very good on this point and he said it a little better than i 'll say it he said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct and then it is our duty it 's not a matter of calculation so let 's stop we how should we be making our decisions whether we should use that guy 's data or not what 's the formula there 's not a formula there 's not a simple answer ethics is hard ethics requires thinking i spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us that and we can do it not only can we think we must hannah arendt said the sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who it arises from not thinking that 's what she called the banality of evil so let 's do that let 's think in fact let 's start right now every person in this room do this think of the last time you had a decision to make where you were worried to do the right thing where you wondered what should i be doing and now did i have somebody vote on it or did i punt to legal or now we have a few more did i evaluate what would be the highest pleasure like mill would this is important it is so important we are going to spend thirty seconds of valuable tedtalk time doing nothing but thinking about this are you ready go that 's the first step towards taking responsibility for what we should do with all of our power now the next step try this go find a friend and explain to them how you made that decision and don 't just find another technologist friend find somebody different than you find an artist or a writer find somebody from the humanities why because they think about problems differently than we do as a few days ago right across the street from here there was hundreds of people gathered together it was technologists and humanists at that big bibliotech conference and they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective you have someone from google talking to someone who does comparative literature you so imagine that right now you went and you found your musician friend and you 're telling him what we 're talking about about our whole data revolution and all this maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music that 's wagner it 's based on norse legend it 's gods and mythical creatures fighting over magical jewelry that 's interesting now we 're moved because it 's about the battle between good and evil about right we care what happens in apocalypse now and we certainly care what happens with our technologies and that 's the good news we 're the ones writing this opera this is our movie we determine how this will all end thank you"
