  "transcript": "a question i 'm often asked is where did i get my passion for human rights wedged between four brothers two older than me and two younger than me so of course i had to be interested in human rights and equality and justice and using my elbows and those issues stayed with me and guided me and in particular when i dedicated my presidency to having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of ireland and bringing together communities from northern ireland with those from the republic trying to build peace and i went as the first irish president to the united kingdom and met with queen elizabeth and also welcomed to my official residence which we call ras an uachtarin the house of the president and i was aware that at the time of my presidency was a country beginning a rapid economic progress we were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the european union indeed when ireland first joined the european union were parts of the country that were considered developing including my own beloved native county county mayo to what i didn 't have to do as president was buy land on mainland europe so that irish citizens could go there because our island was going underwater what i didn 't have to think about either as president or as a constitutional lawyer was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory has to wake up every morning thinking about he has bought land in fiji as an insurance policy what he calls migration with dignity because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands as i listened to president tong describing the situation i really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face and as i i thought about her and those who worked with her on the commission on human rights which she chaired in and drew up the universal declaration of human rights for them it would have been unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of it was because of the impact on people and and i say this with when i served as un high commissioner for human rights from i knew that there was another part of the united nations the un it was later and i kept hearing this pervasive sentence much worse now things are so much worse and then i explored and she told me that she was growing up she had a very normal life in her village and they didn 't go hungry they knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest and so they had enough food the school had been destroyed because of course constance okollet wasn 't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were i was very struck about the situation in malawi in january of this year it covered about a third of the country and the average person in malawi emits about eighty kg so those who are suffering disproportionately don 't drive cars don 't have electricity don 't consume and yet they are feeling more and more the impacts of and i know that we 're not able to address some of that injustice because we 're not on course for for a safe world governments around the world agreed at the conference in copenhagen and have repeated it at every conference on climate that we have to stay below two degrees celsius of warming so we face an existential threat to the and that brought me then to climate justice climate justice responds to the moral argument both sides of the moral argument to address to make sure that they 're not left behind again when we start to move and start to address climate change with climate action as we are doing it 's very striking how many people are in our world of seven point two billion people about three billion and in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting two point six billion people cook on open fires on coal and so we have a very unequal world and we and that means we have and it means that obviously industrialized countries must cut their emissions must become much more energy efficient and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions because they must they have very poor populations so they must develop and that is a different kind of problem no country in the world has actually grown without emissions so it is a a very big challenge and it requires the total support of the international community with the necessary finance and technology and systems and support because no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change this is an issue that requires complete human solidarity human solidarity if you like and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon by and it 's happening very fast in hawaii they 're passing in costa rica they have committed to but it 's still not enough and the political will is still not enough let me come back to president to live on their island and have a solution but it would take a lot of political will president tong told me about his ambitious idea to either build up or even float the little islands where his people live of course is beyond the resources of kiribati itself it would require great solidarity and support from other countries and it would require the kind of imaginative idea but wouldn 't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign be part of the community of nations that is the kind of i was very conscious of this as i took it was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems the devastation of the world wars particularly the second world war the fragile peace that had been brought about the need for a whole economic but the leaders of that time didn 't flinch from this they had the capacity they had a sense of being driven and what did we get what the charter of the united nations and the international monetary fund to reconstruct it and indeed a few years later the universal declaration of human rights two thousand and fifteen is a year that is similar in its importance to and similar potential there will be two big summits this year and then the summit in paris in december to give us a climate agreement the sustainable development goals are intended to help countries to in tune with mother earth not to by living under sustainable development and the sustainable development goals will come into operation for all countries on climate agreement a binding climate agreement is needed and how we move more rapidly to so that we have a safe world the reality is that this issue is much too important to be it 's an issue for the for the business and the good news is that the business community is changing very rapidly except for the fossil fuel industries laughter even they are beginning to slightly change their language but only slightly but business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable so that they can move even more rapidly that one of the greensboro four who had taken part in the woolworth sit ins said quite recently that climate change is the lunch counter moment for young people so lunch counter moment for young people of sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world world and we have to build on that and i saw but we were wedged so closely together because after all there were four hundred thousand people out in the streets of new york so i couldn 't quite get to that placard i would have just liked to have been able to step behind it because it said and i think we know that inevitably it will be a climate constrained world because of the emissions we 've already put up there but it could be a world that is much more if we have no one is left behind looking back seventy years i would like to think that they will look back that world will look back we did what was done we lived up to is about she died much too young to reach a higher moral ground and we have to do it this year in those two big and that won 't happen unless we have the momentum we want a safe world a safe world for future generations a safe world for our children and our grandchildren and we 're all in this together"
