  "transcript": "i want to talk about understanding and the nature of understanding and what the essence of understanding is because understanding is something we aim for everyone we want to understand things and i want to focus on mathematics geometry algebra all that stuff so my day to day definition of mathematics that i use every day it 's about finding patterns i mean a connection a structure some regularity some rules that govern what we see second of all i think it is about representing these patterns with a language we make up language if we don 't have it and in mathematics this is essential it 's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens and you can also do the mathematics of tie knots this is for the patterns of tie knots and a half windsor is all that we can make up languages for it and representations are all he invented a language for patterns in nature when we throw something up in the air it falls down why this is also a pattern this is also an invented language can you guess for what it is actually a notation system for dancing for tap dancing because he has represented it i want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is here it says the word mathematics well they do they represent the word and these symbols also represent that word and this we can listen to it sounds like this somehow these sounds represent the word and the concept how does this happen so i want to talk about that magic that happens when we actually represent something here you see just and i can actually recommend this book it 's a very nice book just so every time we move we move we do this over and over and over just from drawing simple straight lines now i can change my perspective a little bit i can rotate it have a look at the curve what does it look like is it a part of a so i have to continue my investigation and look for perhaps if i copy it and make some art well no perhaps i should extend the lines like this and look for the pattern there let 's make more lines we do this and then let 's zoom out and change our perspective again then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola this is and we represent them and i think this is a nice day to day definition but today i want to go a little bit deeper and think about there 's one thing that 's a little bit deeper and that has to do with the ability to change your perspective you learn something new about what you are so let 's just look at this simple equation but think about it this is an equation and those are two different perspectives and i would go as far as to say that every equation every mathematical equation where you use that equality sign and you 're expressing that in a language this is one of the most beautiful equations it simply says this thing on the left hand side is minus one and the other one is let 's take a number we know four thirds we know what four thirds is it 's one point three three three otherwise it 's not exactly four thirds but this is only in base four thirds so these are all representations we can even write it simply like one point three or one point six it all depends on how many digits you have or and you can visualize this in many ways what i 'm doing now is viewing that number from different perspectives i 'm playing around i we can take a grid this is your average computer screen eight hundred x six hundred or one thousand six hundred x one thousand two hundred is a television so these are all nice representations but i want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number you can see this it actually goes exactly four thirds as fast we get this dot dancing around and this emerges from four thirds i like to say that this is the image of let 's now this is the perfect fourth if the first one is an right i can take a rhythm and play three beats at one time in a and i can play another sound four times in that same space sounds kind of boring but listen to them and i can keep doing this and play games with this number four thirds is a really great number i love well i want to talk about what it means to understand something let 's look at this letter and you 've generalized so you know that this is an r and i 'm a teacher and a lecturer and i can actually use this to teach something because when i give someone else another story a metaphor an analogy that will become easier now we 're going to play a game we 're going to fold it up into a three dimensional structure i it 's one of the five platonic and i can change the axis and then i can view it from another point of view but it 's the same thing but it looks a little different i can take two of these and if you take two of these join them together and spin it around there 's your octahedron again a beautiful structure if you lay it out flat on the floor this is the graph structure of an octahedron and i can continue doing this you can draw three great circles around the octahedron i am changing the perspective stepping back and i i think this actually is the essence of understanding something so this thing about changing your perspective it 's absolutely fundamental for humans we can do this with anything we can take the ocean we can we can go to the and you know what this is absolutely essential in mathematics and computer science if you 're able to then you really learn something about it so when we do this and we 've taken this journey and it 's actually a requirement for changing your perspective and that you 're sitting here you can view yourselves from the outside and you 're viewing yourself from the outside and this thing about changing perspectives should sound a little bit familiar and that is how we obtain understanding and this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science and there 's a really deep connection between empathy so my conclusion is the following you can study it 's a wonderful way to train your brain thank you"
