  "transcript": "i 'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change and like this when they have to do with air quality or smog they 're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science recently the headlines looked like this when the or ipcc put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system such a big in fact that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world over fifteen thousand scientists go to san francisco every year for that every one of those scientists is in a research group and every research group studies a wide variety of topics for us at cambridge it 's as varied as the el nio oscillation which affects weather and climate to the assimilation of satellite data to emissions from crops that produce biofuels which is what i study and we study incredibly narrow topics things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules and one of the molecules i study is called isoprene which is here it 's a small organic molecule you 've probably never heard of it the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to nine hundred zeta illion it 's a huge amount of stuff it 's equal to the weight of methane and because it 's so we blow it up and look at the pieces this is the euphore smog chamber we run enormous models on supercomputers and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what 's happening we found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of scientific off this tower to look for isoprene and other things while we were there this is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above and the tower from below and this plane the model normally flies one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty people so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today but we didn 't just fly it we were flying at one hundred meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule we have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering we need special flight clearance as you come around the banks in these valleys the forces sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule they write one scientific paper on the subject and out of that field campaign we 'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules as a body of knowledge builds up it will form one subsection or one and each one of the eleven chapters of the six to ten subsections so you can imagine the scale of the effort thank you very much"
