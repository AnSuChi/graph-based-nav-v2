  "transcript": "awoke to gunfire the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces presumably from the local criminal organization la familia michoacana or the michoacn family the citizens didn 't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city so truly like a battlefield after these two days and during a particularly intense encounter it was presumed that the leader of la familia michoacana nazario moreno was killed the idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state and so the day of the scheduled procession thousands of people showed up as the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march his team noticed that while half of the participants the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime and they continued their path towards the state capital this story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization metaphor for what 's happening in mexico today where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all mexican citizens are equal because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between sixty and one hundred thousand people have lost their lives in drug related violence to put these numbers in perspective this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the iraq and afghanistan wars combined because nameless dead people implicitly or and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner or most likely both and so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died and so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved they were part of the bad guys and that creates some some form of comfort for a lot of people however and them as the bad guys if you think about it the latter are only providing a service to the former whether we like it or not the is the largest market for illegal substances in the world accounting for more than half of global demand it shares thousands of miles of border with mexico that is its only route of access from the south and so as the former dictator of mexico porfirio diaz used to say poor mexico so far from god and so close to the united states if we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part which we know is false that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between fifteen billion and sixty billion dollars to put these numbers in perspective microsoft has yearly revenues of sixty billion dollars and it so happens that this is a product that because of its nature a business model to address this market requires you and the only way to do this hence the violence if you look at a map of cartel influence and violence you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north the only thing that the cartels are doing is that they 're trying to protect their business it 's not only a multi billion dollar market but it 's also a complex one for example the coca plant is is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized international production that by the way needs to have good quality control because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it and so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels i urge you but only a little bit because i don 't want to get you in trouble to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want wherever you want it whenever you want it anywhere in the u s and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message guarantee delivery of the drug in thirty minutes or less think about this for a second think about the complexity it 's very difficult to reconcile this ignorant goons that are just shooting each other very difficult to reconcile now as a business professor and as any business professor would tell you an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure good incentives a solid identity and good brand management and maybe be confused by the fact that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles you will the knights templar which is the new brand for the familia michoacana that i spoke about at the beginning and the sinaloa federation you will read that los zetas is this assortment of sociopaths and this is somewhat true or mostly but this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy you see los zetas when that corridor became contested they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm so they recruited los zetas an entire unit they were incredibly effective as enforcers for the gulf cartel so much so that at some point they decided to just take over the operations which is why i ask you to never keep tigers as pets because the zetas organization was founded in treason they lost some of the linkages to the production and this is again based on their military origin was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do and so because they didn 't have access to the more profitable drug markets this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime prostitution local drug dealing and human trafficking including of migrants that go from the south to the u s so what they currently run is truly and quite literally better promotion paths not to mention much better food than what the army can deliver they let people know that they are there and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say i offer you to be the local representative of the zeta brand if they agree and you don 't want to know what happens if they don 't they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town in exchange for royalties and so los zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature but again that 's just a brand strategy but what i am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all when you count when you do the body count they 're actually all the same in contrast to them the knights templar that arose in michoacn emerged in reaction to the incursion of the zetas into the state of is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in mexico and it has very direct routes to the center of mexico which then gives you direct access to the u s and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise they brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of michoacn against organized crime their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement so they invest heavily in providing local services like dealing with home violence going after petty criminals treating addicts and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are but when they kill them they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them through and so we 're actually here to protect you they as social enterprises do and here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions they have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade but the way they do it is because they control all of michoacn and they control the port of lzaro crdenas they leverage that to for example trade copper from michoacn that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from china which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the sinaloa federation u s finally the sinaloa federation when you read about them you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration they started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the u s and the but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution they have cultivated a brand of professionalism business acumen they have designed new drug products and new drug processes they have and you can see that these are not the shawshank redemption types they have invented catapults you name it one of the leaders of the sinaloa federation actually made it to the forbes list [ # seven hundred and one joaquin guzman methamphetamines when they either through marriages or other types like any other multinational would they protect their brand they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this to further strengthen their brand they actually have professional p r firms they have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides and so differences aside what these three organizations share is on the one hand a very clear understanding but rather they are built from the bottom up they have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies the first one is that drug violence is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes the second thing i want you to remember is that these are sophisticated coherent organizations and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach the third thing i want you to remember is that even though we 're more comfortable with this idea of them a set of bad guys separated from us we are actually accomplices to them either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption these organizations service recruit operate within our communities so necessarily they are much more integrated within them and so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have we see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will the question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn thank you"
