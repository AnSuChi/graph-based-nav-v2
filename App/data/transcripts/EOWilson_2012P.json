  "transcript": "give a few notes and this is from a book i 'm preparing called letters to a young scientist i 'd thought it 'd be appropriate to present it on the basis that i have had extensive experience in teaching counseling scientists across a broad array of fields so let me begin to go as far as you can the world needs you badly humanity is now fully into the molecular genetics the immunology the microbiology the public health to the new area of the human body as a symbiont environmental science knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every fifteen the two already pervade as most of you here seated realize so swift is the velocity so startling in its countless twists and turns that no one can predict its outcome even a decade when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge which actually began in the 1600s has to peak and level off but that 's not going to matter to you the revolution is going to continue for at least several more render the human condition radically different from what it is today traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines in time all of science will come to be a continuum of description that 's why you need not just be training in one specialty but also acquire breadth keep your eyes lifted the search for knowledge is in our genes it was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world and it 's never going to be quenched to understand and use it sanely as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you business and the media that exist today our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific literacy which most badly lack today no applause please it will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job therefore you will do well to act on the side no matter how far into the laboratory you may go many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically a metaphor will serve here where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank are the ones who map the terrain they scout the frontiers they cut the pathways some may have considered me i watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non required courses in science because they were afraid of failure science and medicine of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent here 's how to relax your anxieties if you have them understand that mathematics is a language ruled like other verbal languages or like verbal language generally by its own grammar and system of logic any person with average quantitative intelligence intelligence who learns to read and write mathematics at an elementary level will as in verbal language have little difficulty picking up most of the fundamentals if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science the longer you wait to become at least semi literate the harder the language i didn 't take algebra they didn 't teach it where i sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students little more than half my age a couple of them were students in a course i was giving on evolutionary biology and i learned calculus i found out that in science and all its applications what is crucial is not that technical ability i found out that advances in science rarely come upstream they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work during which mathematical ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake of foremost importance is a thorough knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter when something new is discovered it 's logical then that one of the follow up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward if that step proves too difficult for the person or team that made the discovery a mathematician then be added by them consider the following principle which i will modestly call wilson 's principle number one it is far easier for scientists including medical researchers to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations is important in choosing the direction to take in science to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply and focus on that keep in mind then wilson 's second principle for every scientist at any level of mathematical competence there exists a discipline in science or medicine for which that level is enough to achieve excellence now i 'm going to offer quickly several more principles that will be useful in organizing your education and career or if you 're teaching how you might enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on the essential requirement of broad training or the value of apprenticing yourself in ongoing research to programs of high quality it is important also to acquire older mentors but through it all look for a way to break out to find a field and subject not yet popular we have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine there is the quickest way advances are likely to occur as measured in discoveries per investigator per year you may have heard the military dictum in science the exact opposite is the case observe from a distance but do not join the fray make a fray of your own once you have settled on a specialty a specialty and the profession you can love and you 've secured opportunity there are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine and on then into the social sciences where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority when the subject is still very the world needs this kind of and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it the existing information and what may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect to other bodies of knowledge the answer deserves to be stated as principle number four in the attempt to make scientific discoveries every problem is an opportunity and the more difficult the problem the greater will be the importance of its now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made follow one or the other of two pathways first through early discoveries a problem is identified the problem may be relatively small for example where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread or larger what 's role of dark matter as the answer is sought other phenomena are typically discovered and other questions are asked this first of the two strategies is like a hunter exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry who finds other quarries along the way second strategy of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter original research can be stated the final principle i 'm going to offer you and conversely for every species or other entity or phenomenon there exist important problems for the solution of which particular objects of research are ideally suited find out what they are you 'll find your own way to discover to general health the quality of life all of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master you have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction at its conclusion of a life well lived and i thank you for having me here tonight"
