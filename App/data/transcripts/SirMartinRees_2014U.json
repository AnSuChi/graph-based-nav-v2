  "transcript": "ten years ago i wrote a book which i entitled our final century question mark my publishers cut out the question mark the american publishers changed our title to our final americans like instant gratification and the reverse and my theme was this our earth has existed for forty five million centuries but this one is special threats have come from nature asteroids and so forth but from now on the worst and it 's now not just the nuclear threat and social media can spread panic and rumor literally at the speed of light we fret too much about minor hazards carcinogens in food low radiation doses and so forth but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios but if an event is potentially devastating it 's worth paying a substantial and as science offers greater power and promise the downside gets scarier too we get ever more vulnerable millions will have the capability to misuse foresaw that children will design and create new organisms but were even part of his scenario to come about our ecology and even our species would surely not survive long unscathed for instance there are some who think that it would be better for the planet for gaia if there were far fewer humans what happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread by two thousand and fifty or a network that develops a mind of its own threatens us all well can we guard against such risks by regulation but these enterprises are so competitive and so driven by commercial pressure that anything that can be done whatever the regulations say 's like the drug laws we try to regulate but can 't and they 'll have a global range so as i said in my book we 'll have a bumpy ride through this century there may be setbacks to our society indeed a fifty percent chance of a severe setback but reassurance could be offered i and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times but scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends consider two scenarios scenario a wipes out ninety percent of humanity scenario b wipes out one hundred percent how much worse is b than a the body count is ten percent higher claim that b is incomparably worse as an astronomer i can 't believe that humans are the end of the story it is five billion years before the sun flares up and the universe may go on forever so post human evolution here on earth and far beyond could be as prolonged as darwinian process that 's led to us and even more wonderful so we surely in view of those immense stakes shouldn 't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential some scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction but others may be 's an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable and in fact that 's why we at cambridge university are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks and we need all the help we can get from others because we are stewards of a precious pale blue dot in a vast cosmos a planet with fifty million centuries ahead of it and so let 's not jeopardize that future and i 'd like to finish with a quote from a great scientist called peter medawar i quote the bells that toll for mankind are like the bells of alpine cattle and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound thank you very much"
