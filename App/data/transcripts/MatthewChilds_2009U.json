  "transcript": "it 's pretty simple there are nine sort of rules that i discovered after thirty five years of rock climbing number one don 't let go but really truly often you think hesitation is bad this is a friction climb up in tuolumne meadows in the yosemite high country friction climbing doesn 't have any sort of hard positive edges climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock the most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your and then from that point on you 're basically falling don 't stop this climber is on the last pitch of it he 's actually right about where i fell and all the hard pitches are actually below him often what happens is you 're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part how do i get through the hardest part and then what happens you get to the last pitch it don 't do it you have to plan ahead to get to the top but you also can 't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete this is a climb called the dike route on pywjack so you 've got to rule number five know how to rest it 's amazing the best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest and keep going this fear really sucks because what it means is you 're not focusing on what you 're doing you 're focusing on the consequences of failing at what you 're doing because any given move should require all your concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively one of the things in climbing is most people sort of take it straight on and they follow the most obvious solution this is the devils tower in wyoming which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from close encounters with this typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing the cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips opposing pressure and forcing yourself up rule number eight strength doesn 't always equal success in the thirty five years i 've been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls and stuff like that the most important thing i 've learned was guys will always try to do pull ups beginning guys it 's like they thrash they thrash they get fifteen feet up and they can do about fifteen pull ups women are much more in balance because they don 't have that idea that they 're going to be able to do one hundred pull ups they think about how to get the weight over their feet because it which is your strongest muscle"
