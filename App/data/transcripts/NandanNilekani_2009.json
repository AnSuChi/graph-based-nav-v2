  "transcript": "let me talk about india it 's only when ideas take root that things change slowly ideas lead to ideology lead to policies that which led to all the ideas of the state and social security and all the other things that happened in roosevelt 's time in after the global economic crisis there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene the first to my mind is what the second set of ideas i call ideas in progress those are ideas which have been accepted but not and the fourth thing which i believe is most important is the ideas that we need to anticipate because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently the first is really the notion of people we thought of people as a burden we thought of people as a liability and i believe this change in the mindset of looking at and india is experiencing that india is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next thirty years what is unique about this demographic dividend is and this is very important at the same one is in the south and in the west of india which is already going to be because in that part of the country the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a west european country but a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital they have lights to study at night only in those cases can you really get the benefit therefore india is at a critical after sixty years because of the rise of entrepreneurship entrepreneurs have become this change has contributed to the vitality and this has made it something which sells eight million mobile phones a month of which ninety percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don 't have credit history forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than twenty cents at each recharge that is the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible and therefore technology has gone from being seen as something twenty years back when there was a report on bank computerization they didn 't name the report as a report on computers they call them as ledger posting machines they and when they wanted to have more advanced more powerful computers they called them advanced ledger posting machines after having lived for more than two hundred years under the east india company and but today as indian companies go abroad as indians come indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in and the fact that the demographics are in our favor because makes globalization all the more attractive to indians and finally india has had the deepening of its democracy when democracy came to india sixty years back it was an elite concept it was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of and therefore democracy has become embedded i believe these six factors the rise of indian entrepreneurs the rise of english as a language of aspiration and the deepening of democracy has contributed to why india is today growing at rates it has never seen and really there are four things here one is the question of education for some reason whatever reason lack of money lack of priorities because of religion having an older culture unfortunately the government schools don 't function so there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work but having said that there is an enormous desire among everybody including the poor to educate their children so i believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented but today i believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement it is reflected in the political statements twenty years back the political slogan was the third thing is again cities it 's and that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see after economic reforms and economic growth i think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth cities are engines of creativity again an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented the final thing is the notion of india as a single market and therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products every so there is a form of internal globalization which is happening which is as important as external globalization these four factors i believe the ones of primary education infrastructure urbanization and single market in my view are ideas in india which have been accepted but not implemented the ideas that we argue about these are the arguments we have which cause gridlock what are those ideas one is i think are ideological issues because of the historical indian background in the caste system and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold a lot of the politics it 's also related to the way that we subsidize our people and all the left and right arguments that we have a lot of the indian problems are related to the ideology the second one is the labor policies that we have which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies that ninety three percent of indian labor is in the unorganized sector they have no benefits they don 't have social security they don 't have pension they don 't have healthcare none of those things therefore we need to create which are are not as onerous as they are today at the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for the third thing is our higher education it 's very difficult for a foreign university to come to india as a result of that that is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address the first thing is we 're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had higher state of so there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with similarly today in the west you 're seeing the problem of entitlement the cost of social security the cost of medicare the cost of just to give an idea the world has at something like but if india grows income per year per person will go to sixteen times by two thousand and fifty so we 're saying income growing at sixteen times and no growth in carbon therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look now why does this matter to you why does what 's happening ten thousand miles away matter to all of you number one this matters because this represents more than a billion people a billion people one 6th of the world population it matters because this is a it 's important because you need it to solve the world 's environment problems"
