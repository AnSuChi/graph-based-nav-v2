  "transcript": "and while i 've tried to make my images not too graphic keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do because after all what a surgeon does to a patient if it were done without consent would be a felony fixing you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together so in order to give you how we even came to believe that surgery was that this was something that was possible to do that this kind of cutting and reforming was ok so a little bit of perspective dating back five to ten thousand years five to ten thousand years now imagine this he 's got some seizure disorder and you don 't understand this but you think to yourself i 'm but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it now we 've got the dawn of interventional surgery here what is astonishing about this is even though we don 't know really how much of this was intended to be religious or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic what we can tell is that these patients judging by the healing on the borders of these holes they lived days months years following trephination and so what we are seeing is evidence this arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another we really are seeing the dawn of and we see new refined tools coming out but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold trephinating ancestors these guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries and surgeons were tradesmen rather than this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance that may have saved the writers but it didn 't really save the surgeons terribly much they were still a mistrusted lot surgeons still had a bit of a pr problem because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber surgeon these were folks that traveled from village to village town to town doing surgery sort of because we were in the age before anesthesia of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself frere jacques shown here doing a lithotomy which is the removal of the bladder stone one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time had to take less than two minutes you had to have quite a flair and so here you see him doing a lithotomy which is an astonishing number when you think that surgery must have been a last resort i mean who would put themselves through that the absence of a whole new era of surgery was ushered in anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment to start to delve deeper into the body but the patients died they died of massive infection and infection would continue to claim a majority of or sterility 's biggest advocate to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons the mayo brothers came out to visit lister in europe and they came back to their american clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards these surgeries were actually now being effective with the patient insensitive to pain and a sterile operating field you could now start doing surgery everywhere and it would work the era of the big surgeon at quite a cost because they are saving lives but not necessarily quality of life because healthy people and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that the question had to be asked well can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that that allowed this to be done for real operations so what you see this is now the first surgical image as we 're coming down the tube this is a new entry into the body it looks very different from what you 're expecting surgery to look like within ten years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done laparoscopically a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically truly a but there were casualties of this revolution these techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated the learning curve was very long and during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher surgeons had to give up their this surgeon has over three thousand hours of laparoscopic experience now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle but this is hard and one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible you 've got these long instruments and you 're working off your centerline and the instruments are essentially working backwards and put it on the other side of that small incision is you need to put a wrist and so i get to talk about robots the da vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that and so here you 're seeing the operation of this wrist and now in contrast to the laparoscopy you can precisely place the needle in your instruments and the reason why this becomes so much easier is you can see on the bottom the hands are making the motions and the instruments are following those motions exactly now what you put between those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot the surgeon is sitting at a console and you have a and since this was introduced in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical you can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart and you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside you 've got these technologies thank you and so you might say wow this is really cool so smartypants why isn 't all surgery being done this way and there are some reasons some good reasons and cost is one of them i talked about the large complicated robot with all its bells and whistles one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon more useful than a solid gold surgeon but still it 's a fairly big capital investment but once you 've got it your procedure costs do come down and so it 's perfect for something like that and in fact if you or anyone you know had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years chances are it was done with one of these systems and you need to re set it up and then you need to add some more ports and more and the problem is it gets and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren 't being done with the da vinci so we had to ask the question well how do we fix that what if we could change it so that we didn 't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place and how would that change the experience for the patient now to do that we need to be able to bring a camera and instruments in together or not so coincidentally like a tube like this so what 's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere this is the camera and three instruments and as you see it come out in order to actually be able to do anything useful it can 't all stay clustered up like this it has to be able to come off of the centerline but what this lets you do is gives you that but it 's all coming in through one incision it 's but it 's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we 're going around for the it 's transparent this is all they 're going to see it 's very exciting to think where we get to go with this and we get to go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution we need to see beyond the surface we need to be able to guide what we 're cutting one of the problems with this even for surgeons who 've been looking at this a lot is you can 't see the cancer and so what we 're starting to do is we 're starting to inject specially designed markers into the bloodstream that will target the cancer it and we can take special and we can look at it so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart we can see if we actually made the connection before we close that patient back up again something that we haven 't been able to do without radiation before so that you can exactly see where the boundary is between the kidney tumor or the liver tumor and we don 't even need to confine ourselves to we have flexible microscopic probes and we can look at cells directly and the microscope probe that 's being held by the robotic hand up at the top but you care about nerves if you are a surgical patient because they let you keep continence all of which is generally fairly important to the patient and we can see it all all we can someone abstract outside this room and that is not the case many of you all of you maybe and when you get to that point i mean these maladies don 't care how many books you 've written how many companies you 've that nobel prize you have yet to win how much time you planned to spend with your children these maladies come for us all"
