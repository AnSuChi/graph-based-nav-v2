  "transcript": "to unpack for you three examples of iconic design and it makes perfect sense that i should be the one to do it because i have a bachelor 's degree in literature but i 'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs so i pretty much know everything there is now i 'm sure you recognize this object many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at los angeles international airport over the past couple of days this is known as that is its name for reasons that are still very murky and it is perhaps the best example we have in los angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture it was first excavated in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one as they were building lax although scientists believe that it dates back to the year two thousand when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants it is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located of course at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design which came to be synonymous with the jet age a after all the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls ah yes a table we use these every day and on top of it the juicy its playfulness its innovation and its promise of imminent violence which would be useful out in the it is in fact a citrus juicer and when i say that you never see it as anything else it is also not a monument to design it is a monument to design 's which will stay where it is forever this is affordable and can come home with you and as such it can sit on your kitchen counter it can 't go in your drawers trust me i found that out the hard way and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design one other it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep i don 't get it does anyone know chi it 's an i had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days no i have an iphone of course i do here is my i use it every day to measure the weight of an ox for example every now and then admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally and yet i forget about it all the time this is a design that once you saw it you forgot about it it is easy to forget the gasp inducement that occurred in two thousand and seven when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life unlike what it did was it took technology which unlike people in this room to many other people in the world still feels very alien rather it simply itself to your brain so there you go my name is john hodgman i just explained thank you very much"
