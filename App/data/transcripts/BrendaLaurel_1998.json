  "transcript": "i started working for a company called interval research which was just then being founded by david lidell and paul allen i met with david to talk about what i might do in his company i was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn 't think they could sell and david and i discovered that we had a question in common that we really wanted the answer to and that was why hasn 't anybody built any computer games for little girls why is that it can 't just be a giant sexist conspiracy these people aren 't that smart there 's six billion dollars on the table they would go for it if they could figure out how so what is the deal here and as we thought about our our goals i should say that interval is really a humanistic institution in the classical sense that humanism at its best finds a way to combine clear eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people the basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life that we can do good things that there are things worth doing because they 're good things to do and that clear eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them contrary to popular belief there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values and interval research is kind of the living example of how that can be true so david and i decided to go find out through the best research we could muster what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands hands on a computer to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games and these people davis masten and christopher ireland changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be they taught me how to look and see and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child of all these things we already make you which do you like best which gives you zero answers that are usable what we did for the first two and a half years was was four things we did an extensive review of the literature in related fields like cognitive psychology spatial cognition gender studies play theory sociology primatology thank you frans de waal wherever you are i love you and i 'd give anything to meet you after we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing because after all that 's really what this is about we moved to the second phase of our work where we interviewed adult experts confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions about gender difference and play then we did what i consider to be the heart of the work one hundred children boys and girls ages seven to twelve all over the united states except for silicon valley boston and austin because we knew that their little families we pulled together some survey data from another ten thousand children drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics for designing products and in fact any kind of products for little girls ages eight to twelve in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six in november we formed the company purple moon which was a spinoff of interval research and our chief investors were interval research vulcan northwest we launched a website on september 2nd that has now spend an average of thirty five minutes a visit and look at fifty pages a visit so we feel that we 've we launched two titles in october rockett 's new school the first of a series of about a character called rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place with a blank slate which allows girls to play with the question of what will i be like when i 'm older what 's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school who are my friends to exercise the the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves these two titles both showed up in the top fifty entertainment titles in pc data entertainment titles in pc data right up there with john madden football which several hundreds of thousands of little girls we 've made half a billion impressions with marketing and pr for this brand purple moon ninety six percent of them roughly have been positive four percent of them have been other i want to talk about the other because the politics of this enterprise in a way have been the most fascinating part of it for me there are really two kinds of negative reviews that we 've received one kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be and won 't show the product to little girls odd bedfellows have one thing in common they haven 't looked at children and they 're certainly not demonstrating any love for them i 'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two and a half years of research that we did actually some of the voices are more recent and these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives of the things that they value and care about these are pictures the girls themselves never saw but they gave to us hers is more into boys girl two uh yeah girl one we have in the very beginning of the whole game always we very rich not rich you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy you would think that girls ' games were kinda sissy a vacation like when i get mondays and all those days off sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters or brother or sister when they copy you and you get your idea first and show you real quickly just a minute of rockett 's tricky decision which went gold two days ago let 's hope it 's really stable this is the second day in rockett 's life the reason i 'm showing you this is i 'm hoping that the scene that i 'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar now that you 've listened to some girls ' voices did you hear about nakilia 's big halloween party this weekend she asked me to make sure you knew about it nakilia invited reuben too but i heard his band is playing at another party the same night max 's party is going to be so cool whitney he 's invited all the best people bl i 'm going to fast forward to the decision point because i know i don 't have a lot of time after this awful event occurs rocket gets to decide how she feels about it rockett who 'd want i could get invited to that party any day if i wanted to gee 'll make max 's best people list bl ok so we 're going to emotionally navigate if we were playing the game that 's what we 'd do if at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters we can go into this hidden hallway and i 'll quickly just show you the interface we can for example go find miko 's locker and get some more information about her oops i turned the wrong way but you get the idea of the product i wanted to show you the ways innocuous as they seem in which we 're incorporating what we 've learned about girls their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility and to play around with i want to make the point that what we 're giving girls i think through this effort we see them we but we 're really really happy about who they are it turns out they 're really great i want to close by showing you a videotape that 's a version of a future game in the rockett series that our graphic artists and design people put together that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers"
