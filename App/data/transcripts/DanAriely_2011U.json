  "transcript": "i have a fantastic new treatment for you i was and he explained to me that when i shave i have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is but on the right side of my face i was badly burned so i have no hair and this creates lack of symmetry he was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side let me tell you this was a strange way to shave because i thought about it and i realized that the way i was shaving then would be the way i would shave for the rest of my life because i had to keep the the width the same when i got back to his office i said can i see some evidence for this so he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots not very informative i said what happens when i grow older and my hair becomes white what would happen then whiten it out but i was still concerned so i said you know what i 'm not going to do it and then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life this is coming from a jewish guy all right so that means a lot laughter and he said dan what 's wrong with you do you enjoy you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently none of those happened but i decided not to have this treatment and i went and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing now you but let me give you a different perspective on the same story and when we run so we had one group that i hoped their and when i got the results that 's what we got i was very happy destroying my statistical significance of the test so i looked carefully at this guy he was and i remembered that the drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy fantastic i thought let 's throw him out who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample but a couple of days later we thought about it with my students and we said what would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition what would have happened if he was in the other group would we have thrown him but you know these stories and lots of other experiments that we 've done basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me the first one is that in life we encounter many people who in some way or another try to tattoo our faces they just have the incentives that get them to be blinded and i 'm sure that it 's something that we all recognize and we see that it happens maybe we don 't recognize it every time but we understand that it happens that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives and that 's a much much more difficult lesson to take into account because we don 't see how conflicts of interest work on us when i was doing these experiments in my mind i was helping science i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through i wasn 't doing something bad in my mind i was actually but this was not the case i was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions and i think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us i do want to leave you with one positive thought all very depressing right people have conflicts of interest we don 't see it and so on the positive perspective i think of all of this is that if we do understand when we go wrong if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail we can actually hope to fix things and that i think is the hope"
