  "transcript": "i would start with a simple request i 'd like all of you to to pause for a moment you wretched weaklings and take stock of your that was the advice that st benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century it was the advice that i decided to follow myself when i turned forty and i decided that i would try and turn my life around in particular but all i learned about work life balance from that year was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i didn 't have any work not a very useful skill especially when the when the money runs out so i went back to work and i 've spent these seven years since struggling with studying and writing about work life i have four observations i 'd like to share with you today the first is if society 's to make any progress on this issue we need an honest but the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work life balance all the discussions about which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you 're and the reality of the society that we 're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there where they work long hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don 't need to impress people they don 't like it 's my contention that going to work on friday in jeans and [ a ] t shirt isn 't really getting to the nub of the issue the second observation i 'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren 't going to solve this issue for us we it 's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead it 's particularly important this isn 't on the world wide web is it i 'm about to get fired it 's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial i 'm not talking here just about the bad companies the abattoirs of the human soul as i call them i because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you [ as ] they can get away with it 's in their nature it 's in their dna it 's what they do putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened on the other hand it 's a nightmare it just means you spend more time at the bloody office we have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life the third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame i sat down and i wrote out a detailed description of the ideal balanced day that i aspired and it went like this wake up well rested after a good night 's sleep have sex have sex again laughter drive the kids to school on the way to the office do three play a sport with a friend at lunchtime meditate for half an hour have sex again how often do you think i have that day we need to be realistic you can 't do it all in one day we need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the i 'll have a life when i retire when my kids have left home i 've got no mates or interests left a day is too short after i retire is too long there 's got to be a middle way a fourth observation we need to approach balance in a balanced way so i 've decided to get a grip and sort it out but being a fit 10 hour a day office rat it 's more fit lovely though physical exercise may be there are other parts to life there 's the intellectual side there 's the emotional side there 's the you want me to go to church and call my mother but an incident that happened a couple of years called me up at the office and said nigel you need to pick our youngest son harry up from school because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates we walked down to the local park and we shared a pizza for two then walked down the hill to our home i then read him a chapter of roald dahl 's james and the giant peach tucked him in gave him a kiss on his forehead and said goodnight mate ever i hadn 't done anything now my point is the small things matter being more balanced doesn 't mean dramatic upheaval in your because if enough people do it we can change society 's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins wins to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like and that i think is an idea worth spreading"
