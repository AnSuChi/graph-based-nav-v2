  "transcript": "case in point a i guarantee you you saw something that no one has ever seen before she had almost died in childbirth derartu tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport and paula radcliffe who is a monster the fastest woman marathoner in history by far only ten minutes off the men 's world record paula radcliffe is essentially unbeatable the gun goes off and i mean she 's not even an underdog she 's like under the underdogs there is derartu tulu up there with the lead pack now this is when something really bizarre happens paula radcliffe the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck from derartu tulu 's derartu tulu she catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line but then she falls back again the second time derartu tulu grabs her and tries to pull her and paula radcliffe at that point says i 'm done go so that she loses the check but she goes home with something instead of losing she blazes past the lead pack and wins it 's a heartwarming story you 've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there it 's not a coincidence when you have someone who is more competitive someone with that kind of heart there 's some kind of connection there and the answer to it i think where there 's a reclusive tribe called the tarahumara indians they have been living essentially unchanged for the past four hundred years when the conquistadors arrived in north america you had two choices you either fight back and engage or you could take off the mayans and aztecs engaged which is why there are very few mayans and aztecs they took off and hid in this labyrinthine networking the second thing remarkable about the tarahumara is deep into old age seventy to eighty years old the last thing that 's remarkable about the tarahumara is all the things we 're going to be talking about today all the things we 're trying to use all of our technology and brain power to solve things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer crime warfare and violence clinical depression all this stuff they 're trying to solve those same kinds of and once again a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery perhaps the key to derartu tulu and the tarahumara if you know it you 're smarter than anybody on planet earth australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain suddenly humans show up homo erectus big old melon head early humans are eating dead animals no argument that 's a fact so somehow for nearly two million years now we 're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle they have speed we think usain bolt is fast usain bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel we 're not fast that would be an olympic event turn a squirrel loose whoever catches it gets a gold medal so no weapons no speed no strength no fangs no we killing these animals mystery number one mystery number two women have been in the olympics for quite some time now the fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in four fifteen i could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than four fifteen for some reason you guys are just really slow you get to the marathon we were just talking about you 've only been allowed to run the marathon for twenty years because prior to the 1980s medical science said if a woman tried to run twenty six miles does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run twenty six miles why you were banned from the marathon before the so it 's only been twenty years that women have been allowed to run the marathon in that very short learning curve you 've gone from then you go beyond twenty six miles into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans remember pheidippides died when he ran twenty six miles you get to fifty and one hundred miles and you take a runner like ann trason or nikki kimball or jenn shelton put them in a race of fifty or one hundred miles against anybody in the world and it 's a coin toss who 's going to win i 'll give you an example a couple years ago emily baer signed up for a race called the hardrock one hundred which tells you all you need to know about the race they give you forty eight hours to finish this race well emily baer five hundred runners she finishes in eighth place in the top ten even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race and yet she beat four hundred and ninety two other people the third mystery is this at the university of utah they started tracking until you reach your peak at age twenty seven and then after that you succumb to you 'd think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed maybe ten now i defy you to come up with any other physical activity and please don 't say golf something that 's actually hard where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers so you have these three mysteries is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up but i 'll submit this to you if you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture if you 're wondering why the tarahumara don 't fight and don 't die of heart disease why a poor ethiopian woman named derartu tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons perhaps it 's because humans as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal because the one advantage we have in the wilderness again it 's not our fangs our claws or our speed the only thing we do really really well is is but the advantage of that that so what if we evolved as hunting pack pick out an antelope go out as a pack and run that thing to death that the key to being part of a hunting pack is the word pack if you go out by yourself and you need to have those those expert trackers have to be part of the pack they can 't be ten miles behind you need the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you 're a nursing mother and a developing adolescent it makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead and the people who want to eat it fifty miles away they need to be part of the pack another thing that has to be true this pack cannot be materialistic you can 't be what you end up with it 's a really compelling argument that maybe the tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years that it 's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path you know we look at running as this kind of alien foreign thing this punishment you 've got to do because you ate pizza the night before well how do we try to can it and package it and make it better and then sell it to people and then what happened was we started creating these and i think if anybody in here runs i guarantee within thirty seconds why do we keep getting hurt a curious thing about running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time if you read folklore and mythology any kind of myths any kind of tall tales running is always associated with freedom geronimo used to say my only friends are my legs i only trust we have our digital technology all of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors so how do we get back to that again well i would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging all the sales all the stop focusing on urban marathons which if you do we need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and i would say nakedness that has made the tarahumara so what 's the benefit so what so but maybe there 's another benefit there as well without getting too extreme about this imagine a world where more healthy burn off stress where you don 't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore or go home with a lot of stress on top of you maybe there 's something between what we are today and what the tarahumara have always been and if we find that thing maybe there is a big fat nobel prize out there because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence up political and mental could be astounding you get rid of the shoes you get rid of the stress you get rid of the injuries and the ailments and what you find is something the tarahumara have known then in my early 40s i got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away too so thanks very much"
