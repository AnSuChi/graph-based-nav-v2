  "transcript": "about your mindset does your mindset correspond to my dataset if not one or the other needs upgrading isn 't it when i talk to so one girl said very it 's very easy western world is a long life in a small family developing world is a short life in a large family and here you have the dataset and here length of life life expectancy and how long you can live long then the developing countries applied soap and water vaccination and partly to usa who help to provide and you see all the world moves over to a two child family and a life with sixty to seventy years but some countries and you can see we still have afghanistan down here we have had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born and we in fact when we have played this over the world i was at the global and i could see the wrong concept even they catch up there 's mexico it 's on par with united states in these two social dimensions there was less than five percent of the specialists in global health that was aware of this this great nation mexico has the problem that arms are coming from north across the borders so they had to stop that put income per person and we will then see a completely different picture i can go back and i can let the other countries be shown and the life expectancy was thirty five to forty years on par with afghanistan today and this is instead of studying history for one year at university you can watch me for one minute now where the rest of the world remains behind and then we come up not until you have india over there and this is what has happened did mexico is not at all on par with the united states but they are quite close and especially it 's interesting to see china and the united states during two hundred years because i have my oldest son now working for google after google acquired this software because in fact this is child labor my son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and whereas when my oldest son who works for google he should develop develop by quarter but in china they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period for one so called great leap forward but this was eventually brought health to china and then he died and then deng xiaoping started this amazing whereas china could and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning and asia could have social development before they got what you see here is the flat world of thomas friedman isn 't it it 's not really really flat but the middle income countries and this is where i suggest to my students stop using the concept developing world because after all talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the united states the last and that would be put together into a developing which have great entrepreneurs but also have the collapsing countries so how could we make better sense about this from $ one this is where you have food to eat these people go to bed hungry and this is the number of whether you have a public or a private health service system this is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children and this is oecd countries green latin america but i have to stop at the door of lehman brothers there you know because that 's where the projections are not valid any longer and we have a world which cannot be looked with the united states as and we have the low income countries here yeah this is a fact that from where the money comes they have been saving you know over the last decade and here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are and here we have the countries in because it 's so different what has happened there and that 's why i suggest a slightly different approach of what what you would call it and you have huge differences within countries also i heard that your departments here were but when i split it when i split it into into country bubbles the size of the bubbles here is the population then you see sierra leone and mauritius completely different and here were are we have a continuum in the world it 's lincoln here advancing them it 's eisenhower bringing modernity into and we have countries all this way this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed at this point i decided to make a pause and it is my task on behalf of the rest of the world to convey a thanks to the u s taxpayers it is due to usa 's continuous sponsoring during twenty five years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what 's happening in the world providing facts that it 's useful for the society and providing data free of charge on the internet for the world to use thank you very much quite the opposite of the world bank who compiled data with government money tax money and then they sell it to add a little profit in a very inefficient but as we do and when it comes to free data and transparency united states of america is one of the best and that doesn 't come easy from the mouth of a swedish public health professor and i 'm not paid to come here no and what has happened in the world and we had an increase in income and the blue former we still have as poor countries as we have mdg four the and we used to say that it should fall four percent per year let 's see what sweden has done we used to boast about same child mortality as bangladesh had one thousand nine hundred and ninety though they had lower income i run sweden the same sixteen year period second round and they get malaria eradicated five point five percent they are faster than the millennium development goal and third chance for sweden against brazil here this means that the world is converging they are catching up they are moving to cities where they also get better assistance for that well the swedish students protest at because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for sweden it took a little they got a magnificent health system that beat both the u s and sweden we never thought it would happen that they would win over sweden these red are the countries that doesn 't do it and the policy has to be improved not simplistic extrapolation and we have to there is no such thing as an hiv epidemic in africa and i will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries with the most vibrant economy in africa and a good governance botswana they have a very high level it 's coming down but now it 's not falling because there and it 's not the economy richer country has a little higher if i split tanzania in its income the richer twenty percent in tanzania has more hiv than the poorest one and they are very different and this is the situation you see it 's not deep poverty it 's the special situation probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population and do so to just end up there are things those who have no electricity at home this it 's similar to we have seen it here here in mozambique cause crippling throughout the world and over the last two years two thousand people has been crippled in the southern tip of bandundu region that used to be the illegal diamond trade from the and they are now in great economic problem and one week ago for the were four lines on the internet"
