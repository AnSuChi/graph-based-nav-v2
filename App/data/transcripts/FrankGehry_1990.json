  "transcript": "'m going to go right into the slides and all i 'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff and my ideas are in my head anyway they 're very logical and relate to what 's going on problem solving for clients i either convince clients at the end that that i solve their problems or i really do solve their problems because usually they seem to like it let me go right into the slides can you turn off the and it which is the slide on the right and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they 're photographed or seen i then try to make a a place that 's comfortable and private and fairly serene as i hope you 'll find that slide on the right l a i was concerned about making a place for the study of law and we continue to work with with this client the building on the the garage on the right the gray structure will be torn down finally and several small classrooms will be placed along this and it all related to the clients and the and the students and so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown in a neighborhood that and it was my theory or my point of view that one didn 't upstage the neighborhood one made accommodations i tried to be inclusive to include the buildings in the they were buildings i liked or not in the ' 60s i started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in bloomingdale 's i couldn 't deal with the success of furniture i wasn 't secure enough as an architect and so i closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like so nobody would like this and it was in this preliminary to these pieces of furniture that ricky and i worked on and after we failed i just kept failing the piece on the left and that ultimately led to the piece on the right happened when the and realized you could sit on it and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on so it was an accidental discovery i got into fish i mean the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism at po mo and said that fish were five hundred million years earlier than man and so i started and they started to have a life of their own and got bigger and then i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and and tried to translate what i was learning about the form of the fish and the movement and a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it accidental again it was it was an intuitive kind of thing and i just kept going with it and made this proposal for a building which was only a proposal i was and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff i was really drunk i was asked to do some sketches on napkins and the client said why no fish and so i made a it 's harder to do it and so that made it even more but he was right i couldn 't do the tail i started to get the head ok but the tail i couldn 't do it was pretty hard the thing on the right is a snake form a ziggurat it was a dialog with the context again now if you saw a picture of this as it was published in architectural record they didn 't show the context so you would think god what a pushy guy this is but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering as for craft and technology and all those things that you 've all been talking about i was thrown for a complete loop this was built in six months the way we sent drawings to we made the drawings of the fish and the scales and everything was perfect except the tail so i decided to cut off the head and the and it 's one of the nicest pieces i 've ever made i think and then jay and client asked me to do his headquarters building in l a for reasons toxic waste i guess is the so we built a temporary building i 'm getting good at temporary and we put a conference room in that 's a fish and finally jay dragged me to my hometown toronto canada and there is a story it 's a real story about my grandmother buying a carp on thursday bringing it home putting it when i went to sleep the next day it wasn 't there and the next night we had gefilte fish and so i set up this interior for jay 's offices and he didn 't buy a sculpture so i made one i went around toronto and found a bathtub like my we did a and they were claes ' assistants in the play he was the he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter p for palladio dressed up like the at & t building by claes the highlight of the performance was at the at the end which i get credit for participating in i can tell you it 's totally an oldenburg i had nothing to do with it the only thing i did was i made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal because i love sailing we made it into a sailing craft i 've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing i do it because it 's a curious thing in the culture and there 's so much denial about them people hate it and i 'm fascinated with that which like the paper furniture it 's one of those materials and i 'm always drawn to that and so i did a lot of and that chain link is really expensive it 's in perspective and everything and you can see we started making a building together of course the milk can is his but we were trying to collide our ideas to put objects next to each other like a morandi like the little bottles and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together then jay chiat asked me to do this building and i started with this three piece and he pushed that and one day i had a oh well the other way i had the binoculars from claes and i put them there and i could never get rid of them after that oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of and it was this interaction between that kind of up the ante stuff that became pretty interesting it led to the building on the left and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars i have a hard time connecting with the craft the whole thing about my house the whole use of rough carpentry and everything was the frustration with the crafts available i said if i can 't get the craft that i want i 'll use the craft i can get there were plenty of models for that in rauschenberg and jasper johns and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture and it was all of one material and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls the metalworkers for the most part do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff i was given an opportunity design an exhibit for the metalworkers ' unions of america and canada and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all etc etc and it 's working very well to have these people these i just tell the stories it 's a way of connecting at least with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture and it 's just a complex herman miller has this philosophy of having a place a people place i mean it 's kind of a trite thing to say but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be where the people would come and where the people working would interact so it 's out in the middle of nowhere it 's copper and galvanize i used the galvanize and copper in a very i spent a lot of time everybody 's trying to get the panels perfect and i to get them this is the central area there 's a ramp and that little dome in there is a building by stanley tigerman stanley was and when i was awarded the contract i at the very beginning asked the client if they would let stanley do a cameo piece with me because these were ideas that we were talking about things next to each other making it 's all about [ a ] metaphor for a city maybe and we did it over the phone and by fax he would send me a fax and show me something he 'd made a building with a dome but he put some funny details on it and he moved it closer to my building and so i decided to put him in a in a depression i put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in and so then he put two bridges this all happened on the fax going back and forth over a couple and so then i put this big billboard behind it and it was a very prominent building off the freeway and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of which had these cornices projecting cornices mine got a little exuberant but i used and it turns green in one hundred years instead of like copper in ten or fifteen we redid the side of the building and re proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space and it surprised both boston and myself that we got it approved because they have very strict kind of design guideline the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building and they built it i flew in one night and took this picture but and then more metal and and this is a laser laboratory at the university of iowa it 's the the support labs which by some coincidence required no windows and the shape in the curved part there 's all the mechanical equipment that solid wall behind it is a pipe chase a pipe canyon and so it was an opportunity that i seized because i didn 't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it this is a small house somewhere they 've been building it so long i don 't remember where it is it and we started with the stream and built the house these are the models the reality with the lake the workmanship is pretty bad and it reminded me why i play defensively in things like my house when you have to do something really cheaply it 's hard to get perfect corners and that big metal thing is a passage you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom which is on the right it i was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at yale i thought it was fitting for me to be doing that this is a house next to a philip johnson house in minnesota the owners he ended up having to make it a sculpture because the dilemma was how do you build a building and we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the the main house and all the windows are on the other side and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it it 's made of metal and the brown stuff is 't work i keep trying to make it work in this case we learned how to detail it there 's burnham mall on the left it 's never been finished going out to the lake you can and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site there 's a railroad track this is the and the centerline of the mall goes out burnham had and we followed the axis and and this is our building which is a we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top folded the health you drive down so it 's about a 10 story c clamp and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum and and this would be a hotel so the centerline of this thing and it would start to work etc that are underway it 's hard to do high rise i this is a piece of property in brentwood and a long time ago about ' eighty two or something after my house i designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard and and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left and she came back guess wealthier or something something happened and asked me to design a house for her on this site and i locked the the house into the site by cutting the back end here you see on the photographs of the site looking like a boat and the dome was a request from the client she wanted a dome somewhere in the house she didn 't care where but she said i didn 't have to do that but and then up above there 's a garden on this side of the living room and one on the other know how to do it from here focus the one on the right it anyway you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees that 's the living you enter into the living room and then so on this is the bedroom you come down from this level along the stairway and you enter the bedroom here going into the lake and the bed is back in this space with windows looking out onto the lake these things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot the material is lead copper like in the building in boston and so it was an intent to make this small piece of land it 's one hundred by two hundred and fifty into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table looks like i got a baldessari painting for free but the idea is the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside eventually this will be screened these trees will come up and it will be very private and you this is for and this is in and it 's a freeway building you go go under this bridge and the building will sort of and then this thing here i 'm hoping as you drive by you 'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it kind of a fun thing to do and we struggled with the image these are the early studies but they have to sell furniture to normal people so if i did the building and it was too fancy then people might say well the furniture looks ok in his thing but no it ain 't going to look good in my normal building and we 've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is and you 're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of this is in paris along the there 's a new library across the river we 're doing a very dense building called the american center which has a theater dance school an art restaurants and all kinds of it 's a very dense program bookstores in a very tight small this is the ground level and the french have this extraordinary way of and i struggled with that thing these are the models for this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing so i understood the problem i was trying to get around this plan coupe how do you do it apartments etc kind of study models we did you can see why i was ready to commit suicide when this one was but out of it came finally this resolution where the elevator piece worked frontally to this parallel to this street and also parallel to here and then this kind of with this balcony and the skirt kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer the restaurants here the apartments except for this metal piece and it faces into a park and the idea was to make this express the energy of this on the side facing the street it 's much more normal except i slipped a few mansards down so that coming on the point these housing units and i keep thinking this is going to be the last fish it 's like a drug addict i say i 'm not going to do it anymore i don 't want to do it anymore i 'm not going to do it i do it there it is but it 's the living room and this piece here is i don 't know what it is i just added it so that we 'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out we 've had a lot of fun working together i think i 'm from mars for them and they are for me but somehow we all manage to work together and and the hotel that tony baxter 's group is doing and then this is a kind of a shopping mall with a rodeo and restaurants and what i did because of the paris skies being quite dull i made a light grid it looks like it it 's kind of and then crashed all these simpler forms into it the light grid will have a light be lit up at night and and give a kind of light ceiling and i tried to there 's a nick grimshaw building over here there 's an oldenburg sculpture over here i tried to make a relationship urbanistically and i don 't gave good slides to show it 's just been completed but this piece here is this building and these pieces here and here and as you pass by it 's always part you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood and you wonder if this is a museum what it 's going to be like inside going to be so busy and crazy that and just wait i 'm so cunning and clever but on the outside it does it 's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff and from the building in the back you see it iceberg floating by in the hills it 's it 's related to an existing chandler pavilion that was built with a lot of love and and it 's not a great building but i approached it optimistically that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us and the plan of this it 's a concert hall this is the foyer which is kind of a garden structure there 's commercial at the ground floor these are offices which really composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed in the competition gave us criteria which led to this compartmentalized which we found out after the competition would not work at all but everybody liked these forms and liked the space and so that 's one of the problems of a competition you have to then try and and we studied this was our original model these were the three everybody liked the surround actually this is the smallest hall in size and it has more seats than any of because it has double balconies our client doesn 't want balconies so and we tried many shapes trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical acceptable format finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren 't but now we have them and our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room and the corners would have skylights and and the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit and create intimacy now this is not a final design these are just on the way to being and so i we studied the acoustics with laser and they bounce them off this and see where it all works but you get the sense of the hall in section most halls come straight down into a this case we 're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners and so it will be quite a different shape the because it was frog like fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well when you get into a box it 's harder to do it and here we are struggling with how to put the hotel in but this is how i do work i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away and of course it 's not going to look like that but it is the and then finally i was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of interstate bank tower the highest building in l a larry halprin is doing the stairs and i was asked to do a fish and so i did a snake and it works much better than a fish in barcelona i was asked to do a fish and ritz carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel and so we took the language of this exposed steel and and used it perverted it into the form of the and created a kind of a 19th century contraption that looks like and we split these bridges originally this was all solid with a hole in it we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz carlton anymore because of this fish and finally i just threw these in lou danziger i didn 't expect lou danziger to be here but this is a building i did for him in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four i think a little studio and it 's and this is my son working with me on a small fast food thing he designed the robot as the cashier head moves and i did the rest of it and the food wasn 't as good as the stuff and so it failed it should have been the other way around the food should have been good first it didn 't work"
