  "transcript": "but rather the kind ever since we emerged from the african savannah so i form friendships and co worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people and this spreads on out endlessly into a distance and you get a network that looks like this and my colleague james fowler and i have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical social biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled but recently we 've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight to actually find ways to improve the world to do something better to actually fix things not just understand things and the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic if you 're the cdc or some other national body is to sit in the middle where you are and collect data from physicians and laboratories in the field that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions so so and so patients have been diagnosed with something and if everything goes smoothly one to two weeks from now you 'll know where the epidemic was today and actually about a year or so ago there was this promulgation of the idea of google flu trends with respect to the flu where but also actually early detection of an epidemic and but or or products that people might buy purchases of electronic anything in which there 's kind of an interpersonal spread a kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism i 'm going to show you now so as all of you probably know the classic way of thinking about this is the and on the x axis we have time and at the very beginning not too many people are and you get the epidemic growth and this holds for germs and the like because as i said we live our lives in networks and these networks have a particular kind of a structure now if you look at a network like this this is one hundred and five people and the lines represent the dots are the people and the lines represent friendship relationships you might see that people occupy different locations within the network neighbor relationships and the like for instance people 's smoking behavior might be influenced by their and this is of a node or the number of connections that a node has b a or b is located on the edge of the network now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network a and you have an immediate appreciation that a is going to be more likely to get the thing that 's spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location including node a monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network and somehow get an early and this would be much better without reference to the structure of the population and in fact if you could do that what you would see is something like this on the left hand panel again we have the s shaped curve of adoption in the dotted red line we show what the adoption would be in the on the but here with daily incidence and what we show here is like here very few people are affected more and more and more and up to here and this difference in time between the two is the early detection the early warning we can get about an impending epidemic in the human population however is that mapping human social networks is not always possible just not possible to do such a thing so how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network what we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact or a known fact about social networks which goes like this do you know that your friends have more friends than you do your friends have more friends than you do and and you pick someone and are more central than the random people themselves person who by construction must have at least two and typically more friends we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks and we tested this idea with an outbreak of h1n1 flu at harvard college we took one thousand three hundred randomly selected and we did this passively by looking at whether or not they 'd gone to university health services and also we had them [ actively ] email us a couple of times a week and the difference in the two is sixteen days by monitoring the friends group we could get sixteen days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population now also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends among the friends the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero in adoption of the innovation for example would be evidence of an impending epidemic or you could see the first time the two curves diverged as shown on the left when did the randoms when did the friends take off and leave the randoms and [ when did ] occurred before the peak of the epidemic so this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month and a half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population using and in a minute now i 'm going to put this map into motion we 're going to take daily cuts through the network for one hundred and twenty days and the size of the dots is going to be proportional to so bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu and if you look at this image here we are now in september the 13th you 're going to see a few cases light up you 're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle here we are on october the 19th the slope individuals first before they affect others now as i 've been suggesting this method is not restricted to germs but actually to anything that spreads in populations or voting if i 'm likely to do something that affects others around so if we have a population of a thousand people and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen we don 't have to immunize because even if one or two of the non immune people gets infected there 's no one for them to infect they are surrounded by immunized people so ninety six percent is as good as one hundred percent well but if you took this thirty percent these three hundred people and had them nominate their friends and took the same number of vaccine doses and vaccinated the friends of the three hundred the three hundred friends you can get the same level of herd immunity as if you had vaccinated ninety six percent of the population at a much greater efficiency with a strict budget constraint and in fact we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays [ to do this ] this is a map of eight million phone users in a european country every dot is a person and every line represents a volume of calls between the people and we can use such data that 's being passively obtained to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network without actually having to query them at all we can get this kind of a structural insight and other sources of information as you 're no doubt aware are available about such features from email interactions online and in fact we are in the era of what i would call data collection efforts they 're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom but where everyone is and what they 're thinking based on what they 're uploading and we see a blip up in the truckers or we can monitor the velocity with which people are moving with their phones on a highway and the phone company can see as the velocity or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors passively and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within [ networks of ] doctors or again we can monitor described as in for instance the trucker example where we don 't actually intervene in the population in any way one is like the flu example i gave where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends do they have the flu or not and then get warning or another example would be if you 're a phone company you figure out who 's central in the in the network and you ask those people look will you just text us your fever every day just text us your temperature and collect vast but from centrally located individuals and be able on a large scale to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people or photographing or monitoring elections and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena in fact the availability of these data i think heralds a kind of new era of what i and i and others would like to call computational social science it 's sort of like when galileo or leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope or actually invented and could see biology in a new but now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible and actually we can use these insights to improve society and improve human"
