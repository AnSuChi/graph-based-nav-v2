  "transcript": "but i want to tell you the story of pisa oecd 's test to measure the knowledge and 15 year olds around the world and it 's really a story of how international comparisons look at how the world looked in the 1960s in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school and much of the economic success of 1970s some countries caught up and the world didn 't stop in the 1990s so in the ' 60s the and was one of the lowest education performers so this tells us that in a global economy it is no longer the trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need and that tells you that so with pisa we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations now some people have criticized us for this they say you know such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people because we test students with problems they haven 't seen before but if you take that logic you know you should consider life unfair because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school but whether we are prepared for change whether we are prepared for jobs that haven 't been created to use technologies that haven 't been invented to solve problems we just can 't and once hotly contested our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard in our latest assessment in two thousand and nine we measured seventy four school systems this chart shows you the performance of countries in red sort of below oecd average yellow is so so and in green are the countries doing really well you can see shanghai korea singapore canada in north america you can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between 15 year olds in shanghai and 15 year olds in chile and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor but i want to introduce a educators like to talk about equity with pisa we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity in terms of and we see that in some countries the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very very strong opportunities are unequally distributed a lot of potential of young children is wasted we see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you 're born nobody and no country but actually if you look at how countries come out on this picture you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining in fact one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don 't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence and that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people and ever since those results came out policymakers educators researchers from around the world have tried to figure out but let 's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started pisa and i 'm giving them a colored and i 'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students if money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes you would find all the large bubbles at the top no but that 's not what you see spending per student only explains about well less than twenty percent of the performance variation among countries and luxembourg for example the most expensive system you also see and i think that 's one of the most encouraging findings in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well educated countries and poor and badly educated ones a very very let 's look at this in greater detail the red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country 's wealth they invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for korea so luxembourg spends the same per student as korea does but you know parents and teachers and policymakers in luxembourg all like small classes you know it 's very pleasant to walk into a small class students don 't have long hours of learning and basically teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching so you can see two countries spent their money very differently and actually how they spent their money let 's go back to the year two thousand remember that was the year before the ipod was invented this is how the world looked then in terms of of pisa performance if education has become so much more expensive and the bitter truth really is that you know below average performance we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees and for the very first time the public debate in the federal government dramatically raised its investment in education a lot was done and what 's really interesting is that this wasn 't just about optimizing existing policies the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten pisa has transformed that debate and pushed early childhood education right at the center the german education divides children at the age of ten very young children between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and that paradigm and the good news is nine years later you can see improvements in quality and equity but the koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence and korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading well if you only focus on your brightest students you know what happens is disparities grow and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction but still an impressive improvement a major overhaul of poland 's education helped to turn around many of the lowest performing schools and you can see other countries as well portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system raise quality and improve equity and even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pisa is just an artifact of culture of economic factors of social issues of homogeneity of societies and so on it didn 't change its economy it didn 't change the compositions of its population it didn 't fire its teachers it changed its education policies and practice very impressive and all that raises of course the question what can we learn and raised outcomes and of course the question is can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere of course you can 't copy and paste education systems wholesale but but the test of truth is how do you weigh that priority against other priorities how do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer you won 't believe it but there are countries in which the the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success you have some countries reflecting the belief that only and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior when we asked students what counts for success in mathematics nine out of ten japanese students say that it depends on my own investment on my own effort and that tells you a lot about the system that is in the past different students were taught in similar ways high performers on pisa embrace diversity they realize that and they personalize learning opportunities every student knows what matters every student knows what 's required to be successful and nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers high performing systems are very careful and how they structure teacher pay provide an environment also in which teachers work together and they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers in bureaucratic school systems teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching the past was about now the challenge is to enable wisdom high performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control sort of how do you check whether people do what they 're supposed to do in education the goal of the past was standardization in the past the policy focus was on outcomes on provision and the most impressive outcomes of world class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system you 've seen finland doing so well on pisa but what makes finland so impressive is that only five percent and how do they do that they invest resources where they can make the most difference they attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom those countries align policies across all areas of public policy they make them coherent over sustained periods of time and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented knowing what successful systems are doing doesn 't yet tell us how to improve that 's also clear and that 's where some of the limits of international comparisons of pisa are that 's where other forms of research need to kick in and the example of pisa shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards you just can 't rely on the people out there to help you with this but pisa has shown it has taken away excuses from those who are complacent countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world 's leaders if we can every principal every parent see what improvement is possible that only the sky is the limit to education improvement we have laid the foundations thank you"
