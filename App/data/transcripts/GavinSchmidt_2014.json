  "transcript": "complexity and dynamism and patterns of evidence from satellite photographs from videos you can even see it outside your window but the patterns kind of repeat but they never repeat exactly it 's a huge challenge to understand the patterns that you see but you can 't chop it into one little bit and say oh well let me just make a smaller climate i can 't use the normal products of reductionism to get a smaller and smaller thing that i can study in a laboratory and say oh now that 's something i now understand it 's the whole or it 's nothing the different scales that give you these kinds of patterns from the small microscopic particles that seed clouds to the size of the planet itself from ten to the minus six to ten to the eight fourteen orders of spatial magnitude okay well if you think about how you can calculate these things you can take and if i think about a weather model that spans about five orders of magnitude from the planet maybe a month that 's years that 's the stuff that we can 't resolve the 1990s took an even smaller chunk of that only about three orders of magnitude climate models in the and we 're increasing our capability of simulating those at about one extra order of magnitude every decade so what does a climate model look like this is an old climate model admittedly a punch card a single line of fortran we no longer use punch cards we do still use fortran new fangled ideas like c really haven 't but how do we go about doing it how do we go from we can look at all of the different equations that go into and we can code that clouds what happens when clouds form when they dissipate when they rain out that 's another piece what happens when we have radiation coming from the sun going through the atmosphere being absorbed and reflected we can code each of those very small pieces as well we can talk about the role of vegetation each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole and you get something like this you get a beautiful representation of what 's going on in the climate system and every one of those emergent patterns that you can see the swirls in the southern ocean the tropical cyclone in the gulf of mexico and there 's two more that are going to pop up in the pacific at any point now those rivers of atmospheric water all of those are emergent properties that come from the interactions of all of those small scale processes i mentioned there 's no code that says do a wiggle in the southern ocean there 's no code that says have two tropical cyclones that spin around each other all of those things are emergent properties but what we really want to know is what happens to these emergent properties when we kick the system the ozone hole and of course greenhouse gases each of these different kicks provides us with a target they 're always wrong they the question you have to ask is whether a model tells you more information than you would have had otherwise if it does it 's skillful there 's a good match because we understand the physics that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere and what that does to the winds around the southern oceans the eruption of mount pinatubo in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one put an enormous amount of aerosols small particles into the stratosphere the models are skillful but also in the regional patterns the skill associated with solar cycles changing the ozone in the stratosphere the skill associated with orbital the models are skillful when it comes to the 20th century trends over the decades each of these different targets each of these different evaluations leads us to add more scope and leads us to more and more complex situations that we can how does dust from the sahara that you can see in the orange interact with tropical cyclones in the atlantic intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns we can look at this we can look we can look at the impacts of storms on sea salt we can see the and we can ask much more interesting questions how do air pollution and climate the first one the weather is a little bit different to what actually happened the second one are the observations and we 're going through the 1930s there 's variability there are things going on but it 's all kind of in the noise as you get towards the things are going to start to change they 're going to start to look more similar and by the time you get to the we have a very good match up until and that 's because of this phrase here we obviously would trust them more than models so when we go out into the future there 's a difference the future is unknown the and there are choices we can do more work it 's not much more than there is now or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a who won the nobel prize for the chemistry that led to ozone depletion when he was accepting his nobel prize he asked this question what is the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions if in the end all we 're willing to do is stand around but what we do with the information from those models is totally up to you"
