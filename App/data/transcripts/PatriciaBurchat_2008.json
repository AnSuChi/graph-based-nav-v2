  "transcript": "i study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level for most of my research career i 've been using accelerators such as the electron accelerator at stanford university just up the road because as i 'll explain to you the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected what it 's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are at least some of the big questions so almost a quarter or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe is stuff that 's invisible it doesn 't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum it doesn 't reflect it doesn 't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum which is what we use to detect things it doesn 't interact at all so how do we know it 's there we know it 's there by its gravitational effects in fact this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale and i 'll be telling you about the evidence for that what about the rest of the pie this huge mass of all these stars keeps so we have these stars going around in circles like this as you can imagine even if you know physics this should be intuitive ok that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here so what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside when those measurements are made instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant as a function of distance if it 's constant that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see in fact this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter and this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space they tend to cluster and this is an example of a very actually famous cluster the coma cluster and there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster we take a snapshot in a decade it 'll look identical but these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds they 're moving around in in this gravitational potential well of this cluster ok so all of these galaxies are moving we can measure the speeds of these galaxies their orbital velocities and figure out how much mass is in this cluster and again what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be but that cannot account for the mass either in fact there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly i 'm just putting this big blue blob on there ok to try to remind you that it 's there can we see it more visually yes we can and so let me lead you through how we can do this so here 's an observer it could be an eye it could be a telescope and suppose there 's a galaxy out here in the universe how do we see a ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters if we consider a different ray of light one and that was that the gravitational field due to mass will deflect not only the trajectory of particles but will where will this observer see you can respond and the observer sees a ray of light here now take into account the fact that we live in a the rays would lie on a i 'd if there is a cone of light coming into what do i see the deflector and the eyeball in this case are all in a perfectly straight line if they 're slightly skewed we 'll see a different image now you can do an experiment tonight over the reception ok to figure out what that image will look ok but ignore take it over to the machine shop we shave it off and i have a little gravitational lens ok so it 's got the right shape to produce the lensing i grabbed a piece of graph paper i 'm a physicist so draw a little model galaxy in the middle and now put the lens over the galaxy and what you 'll find is that you 'll see a ring an einstein ring now move the base off to the side and the ring will split up into arcs ok and you can put it on top of any image on the graph paper this is a and so here 's an image from the hubble space telescope many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the hubble space telescope well first of all for the golden shape galaxies those are the galaxies in the cluster they 're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical practically of the background galaxies so the streaks that you see all these streaks so what we can do then is based on how much distortion we see in those images we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster and it 's an enormous amount of mass and also they are centered on some so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye so the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter this gravitationally attracting stuff is that galaxies the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large it must be embedded in dark matter we need to discuss something that stephen hawking referred to in the previous session and that is the fact that space itself is expanding so if we imagine a section of our infinite universe and so i 've put down four spiral galaxies ok and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure horizontal or vertical for measuring where things are if you could do this what you would find that with each passing and it 's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space they 're not necessarily moving through space they 're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger ok that 's what the expansion of the universe or space means so they 're moving further apart now what stephen hawking mentioned as well is that after the big bang space expanded at a very rapid rate but because so the expansion slows down with time people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever whether it would slow down you know will be slowing down but continue forever slow down two groups of physicists the startling answer to this question ok from these experiments was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago ok so the expansion of space is actually speeding up this was a completely surprising result we call it dark energy but we don 't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point ok so it 's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in so at this point then what i want to really emphasize to you is that first of all dark matter and dark energy are completely different things ok there are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe and they have very different effects because it gravitationally attracts it tends to encourage the growth of structure ok so clusters of galaxies will tend to form because of all this gravitational attraction dark energy on the other hand is putting more and more space between the galaxies makes it the gravitational attraction between them decrease and so it impedes the growth of structure so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies and how they their number density how many there are as a function of time we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming i said that we don 't have any you know really persuasive argument for dark energy do we have anything for dark matter and the answer is yes i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon ok things that i haven 't even talked about that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting new particle so this is but we don 't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate they are here in the room ok and they didn 't come in the door they just pass through anything they can come through the building through the earth they 're so non interacting so one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it so a crystal that will ring if that happens so and they 've put it deep down in an iron mine in minnesota deep under the ground and in fact in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are there 's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this the large hadron collider a particle physics accelerator that we 'll be turning on later this year it is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the large hadron collider of the big questions"
