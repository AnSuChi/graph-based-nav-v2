  "transcript": "everyone knows that a picture but we at harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning harvard mit the american heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britannica and even our proud sponsors the google and we cogitated about this for about four years ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth five hundred billion words jean baptiste michel so many books actually have been written over the years so we were thinking well now of course if there 's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely now the problem is there 's an x axis for that which is the practical axis this is very very low what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space so it turns out there was a company across the river called that 's very practical and extremely awesome ela since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier publishing books now if those books are not lost to history then they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by google which has scanned fifteen million books to date now when google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we 've got the data when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything what we 're left with is a collection of five million books five hundred billion string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back ten times over a veritable shard of our cultural genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any we took a page out of xkcd and we said stand back we 're going to try science jm now of course we were thinking well let 's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now we now google and jon orwant in particular told us a little equation that we should learn so you have five million that 's extremely extremely impractical laughter now so take for instance all the way up to two thousand and eight that gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing ela so those two billion lines we call them two billion n grams let 's suppose that i am thriving then tomorrow i want to tell you about how well i did and so i i throve alternatively i could say yesterday i thrived well which one should i use and you 'd say steve you 're an expert on the irregular verbs what should i do and he 'd tell you well most people say thrived but some people say throve and you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time two hundred years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair but some thrived so now what i 'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries now this is just two out of two billion billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide jm this one if you just take influenza you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around and global temperature jm you might also want to have a look at this particular n gram and that 's to although you might agree that he might need a better publicist ela you can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty pretty much and it could be big people were walking around obsessed they couldn 't stop talking about all the things they did in one thousand nine hundred and fifty all the things they were planning to do in one thousand nine hundred and fifty all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in one thousand nine hundred and fifty in fact one thousand nine hundred and fifty was so fascinating someone woke up and realized that one thousand nine hundred and fifty had gotten somewhat pass and just like that the bubble burst and the story of one thousand nine hundred and fifty is the story of every year that we have on and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result because then fame now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great heights like mark twain for instance extremely famous so scientists also tend to get famous when they 're much much older like for instance biologists and physics tend to be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician laughter if you do that you might think oh great i 'm going to do my best work when there are more sobering notes among the n grams for instance here 's the trajectory of marc chagall an artist born in one thousand eight hundred and eighty seven and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous except if you look in german if you look in german you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nadir between one thousand nine hundred and thirty three and one thousand nine hundred and forty five before rebounding afterward and of course what we 're seeing is the fact marc chagall was a jewish artist in nazi germany now these signals are actually so strong that we don 't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here 's a simple way to do it well a reasonable expectation is that somebody 's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then maybe you 're benefiting from propaganda jm now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations so for instance here what you expect is basically what you observe this is distribution as seen in germany very different it 's shifted to the there are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about ten times fewer than they should have been but then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda this picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record ela here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because three guys jon orwant matt gray and will brockman over at google saw the prototype of the ngram viewer and they said is so fun we have to make this available for people so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the ngram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you 're interested in and see its n gram immediately also browse examples of all the various books in which your n gram appears jm so people want to be their best put their best foot forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn 't really care about that so we reported this in the science article but it turns out this is just a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences ela people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we 're not going to have to talk we 're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the history of frustration there 's various types of frustration you stub your toe that 's a one a argh that 's an eight a aaaaaaaargh this person studies all the arghs from one through eight a 's and it turns out that the arghs are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating we think that might have something to do with reagan it 's a sizable chunk there 's much more in culture there 's manuscripts there newspapers there 's things that are not text like art and paintings thank you very much"
