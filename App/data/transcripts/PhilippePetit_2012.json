  "transcript": "this sound this smell this sight all remind me of the campfires of my childhood anyone now my story has a lot to do with dreaming although i 'm known to make my dreams come true last year i created a one man show for an hour and a half how i pursue perfection how i cheat the impossible and then ted challenged me philippe can you shrink this lifetime to eighteen minutes but here i am one solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable every second will have its importance and hope to god the audience will be able to follow me the best way for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity so please join me for a minute of silence i cheated it was a mere twenty seconds but hey we 're on ted time when i was six years old fell in love with magic so i looked in the book for the most difficult move now i 'm not supposed to share that with you but i have to show you the card is hidden in the back of now that manipulation was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages one than my hands six years old and i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him well what do you think the magician looked at me and said this is a disaster you cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect two years later one zoop and i 'm not cheating it 's in the back it 's perfect is the motto of all my actions as i 'm studying magic so that 's it and he agrees to sell me three clubs but in america you have to explain what are clubs nothing to do with golf they are those oh when i was buying the clubs anyway here i was progressing with my new clubs but i could not understand but i was not fluid at all until one day i practiced in front of francis and he finally asked can i see those so i proudly showed him my clubs he they are impossible to juggle i heard about those amazing men and women who walk on thin air walkers now i have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood so that 's it i 'm sixteen becoming a wire walker i found two trees trees with character and then a very long rope and i put the rope around and around and around till i had no more rope now i have all of those ropes parallel like this i get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers and i gather them together in some kind of ropey giant ski boots and then wobbly wobbly i get on the ropes well within a few days i 'm able now you can imagine at that time so that is how in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try this is how not to learn wire walking is a tool essential in my life i am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers i am my own teacher progressing in my new art and becoming a street juggler on the high wire within i 'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus except i am not satisfied so i started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission the sydney harbor bridge and i developed a certitude a faith well nonetheless on the top of the world trade center my first step was the murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power i no longer feel i put my left foot shall i ever so slightly shift my weight to the left my right leg will be unburdened my right foot will freely meet the wire on one side a mass of a mountain a life i know on the other the universe of the clouds so full of unknown we think it 's empty ready to swallow me but it is too late the wire is ready decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable so after the walk people ask me how can you top that well i put my world trade center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks or some completely different so each time i draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter as the improvising comic silent character i created forty five years ago i am as happy as when i am in the clouds this here so i cannot street juggle here you understand so you don 't want me to street juggle here right you know that right you don 't want me to juggle right okay this this okay each time i street juggle i use improvisation now improvisation is empowering because it welcomes it allows me now i have done the impossible not once but many times so what should i share oh i know israel some years ago i was invited to open the israel and i thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire i stopped and like a magician i produce a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace well now i must say and in my hotel room each time i practiced eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley comes to wish me the best but he seemed but i also could feel tension on the ground because so i start the walk i make the dove appear people applaud in delight delight and then in the most magnificent gesture i send the bird of peace into the azure flop flop and lands on my head so i grab the dove and for the second time but the dove who obviously 't go to flying school goes flop flop flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole they must think this guy with this dove he must have spent years working with him what now you know obviously cannot fly and something happened somebody somewhere a group of people starts clapping in rhythm with my steps and within seconds the entire valley is applauding in unison with each of my steps but not an applause of delight like before an applause encouragement for a moment the entire crowd forgotten their differences they had become one pushing me to triumph i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony so let 's say i am here and the chair is my arrival and whenever he 's daunted by an impossible situation to solve in instead of giving up he looks at the picture and he says if philippe can do that i can do this and he goes back to work by inspiring ourselves i will never forget this music and i hope now neither will you and look at the world and when you see mountains remember mountains can be moved"
