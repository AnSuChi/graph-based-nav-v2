  "transcript": "we fall in love but what might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage the beautiful locations and the art in this world before we get started in this presentation i just want to but i 'm loving it this is our current platform where you can explore thousands of museums and objects at your fingertips in extremely this month we launched the black history which talk about arts and culture in that community one of my favorite about the craftsmanship behind the soul very exciting take my word for it so moving on swiftly one quick thing i wanted to showcase in this platform which you can share with your kids and your friends right now is you can travel to all these amazing institutions virtually as well one of our recent ideas was with the guggenheim museum in new york where you can get a taste of what it might feel like to actually be there you can go to the ground floor and obviously most of you i assume have been there and you can see the architectural masterpiece that it is but imagine this accessibility for a kid in bombay who 's studying architecture but this is not the purpose of my talk today this exists right now what we now so i am joined today onstage by my good friend and artist in residence at our office in paris cyril diagne who is the professor of interactive design at ecal university in lausanne switzerland what cyril and our team of engineers have been doing is trying to find these connections and visualize a few of these this object you see behind me oh just clarification always seeing the real thing is better in case people think i 'm trying to replicate the real thing so moving on this object you see behind me is the venus of berekhat ram it 's one of the oldest objects in the world found in the golan heights around two hundred and thirty three thousand years ago so let 's zoom we start from this one object this is what we deal with on a daily basis at the cultural institute over six million cultural artifacts curated and given to us by institutions to actually make these connections you can travel through time you can understand more about our society which obviously decade and the contributions in that decade and in those years for art history and cultures we would love to spend hours showing you each and every decade so you can go on your phone and actually do it yourself applause if you don 't mind can hold your applause till later i don 't want to run out of time because i want to show you a lot of cool stuff just very quickly beyond the nice visualization what is the purpose how is this useful this next idea comes from discussions with curators that we 've been having at museums who by the way i 've fallen in love with because they dedicate their whole life to try to tell these stories one of the curators told me what would it be like if you could create a virtual curator 's table where all these six million objects are displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them you can spend a lot of time trust me looking at different objects and understanding where they come from it 's a crazy matrix experience just on this platform thanks to the diversity of the institutions we have we have over two hundred and eleven amazing artworks by this artist now organized and as cyril goes deeper you can see all the but i just wanted to highlight one very quick example which is very timely the bedroom this is an artwork where three copies exist one at the van gogh museum in amsterdam one at the orsay in paris and one at the art institute of chicago but it is united digitally and virtually for anybody to look at so you can experience what we are doing for every single object we want the image to speak and all you need is an internet connection and a computer you have to give cyril a little bit of and this is available for every object modern art contemporary art renaissance you name it even sculpture sometimes you don 't know what can attract you to an artwork or to a museum or to but she thought i was wasting my life with this museum stuff and for her a museum is what you do when you go on vacation and you tick mark and it 's over right and it took around four and a half years for me to convince my lovely indian mother that actually this is worthwhile and the way i did it was i realized one day that she gold so i started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them and the first thing my mom asks me is how can we buy these and obviously my salary is not that high so i was like we can 't actually do that mom but you can explore them virtually and so now my mom every time i meet her she asks me it does not matter how you get in as long as you get in once you get in you 're hooked moving on from here very quickly there is kind of a playful idea actually to illustrate the point of access and i 'm going to go quite quickly on this one we all know that seeing the artwork in person is amazing but we also know that most of us can 't do it and the ones that can afford to do it it 's complicated so cyril can we load up our art trip what do we call it we don 't have a good name for this but we have around one thousand amazing institutions sixty eight countries but let 's start with rembrandt but thanks to the diversity we 've got around five hundred amazing rembrandt object artworks from forty six institutions and seventeen countries let 's say that on your next vacation you want to go see every single one of them that is your you might release ten tons moving on swiftly from here is something a little bit more technical and more interesting all that we 've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections but obviously we have something cool nowadays that everyone likes to talk about which is machine learning so what we thought is let 's strip out all the what we ended up with is this very interesting but has just used visuals to cluster things together each cluster but one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly is this amazing cluster of portraits that we found from museums around the world if you could zoom in a little bit more cyril when we saw all these portraits we were like hey can we do something fun for kids or can we do something playful to get people interested in portraits because i haven 't really seen it 's quite i 'm just going to let cyril show his beautiful face and essentially what 's happening is with the movement of his head we are matching different portraits around the world i don 't know about you but i 've shown it to my nephew and sister and the reaction is just phenomenal all they ask me is when can we go see this and by the for our last quick experiment we call all of these experiments our last quick experiment comes back to machine learning so what we have is this kind of and we haven 't really and we found interesting categories we can start with horses a very straightforward category you would expect to see that the machine has put images of horses right and it has but you also notice right over there that it has a very abstract image that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses we also have an amazing head in terms of of a horse and each one the tags as to why it got categorized in this so let 's move to another one which i found very funny and interesting because i don 't understand how this category came up it 's called lady in waiting you will see that we have these amazing but i 've been trying to ask my museum contacts you know what is this what 's going on here and it 's fascinating coming back to gold very quickly we are living in popular times it tags it as essentially here you have all the bling bling of the world 's museums organized for you and finally to end this what i hope you feel after this talk is happiness and emotion and what would we see when we see happiness if we actually look at all the objects that have been tagged under happiness you would expect happiness i guess but there was one that came up that was very fascinating called i miss my pre internet brain i don 't know why the machine feels like it misses its pre internet brain and it 's been tagged but it 's a very interesting thought i sometimes do miss my pre internet brain but not when it comes to exploring arts and culture online so take out your phones take out your computers go visit preserving all this culture and the least we can do is get our daily dose of art and culture for ourselves and our kids thank you"
