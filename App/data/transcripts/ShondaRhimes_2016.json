  "transcript": "i forced myself to say yes to did i want to speak in public the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear my fear of public speaking my social anxiety but there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way in a and it started with a question from my toddler i have these three amazing daughters harper beckett and emerson and emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as honey as though she 's a southern waitress honey i 'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup the southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when i was on my way somewhere and i said yes i made a vow that from now on every time one of my children asks me to play no matter what i 'm doing or where i 'm going i say yes every single time see i have what most people would i create television i executive produce television i make television a great deal of television four television programs seventy hours of tv each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn 't exist before the budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars let 's just say five a new episode made every nine days times four shows so every nine days that 's twenty million dollars worth of television four television programs seventy hours of tv three shows in production at a time seventy hours of tv that 's three hundred and fifty million dollars for a season my television shows are back to back to back on thursday night around the world my shows air in two hundred and fifty six territories in sixty seven languages for an audience of thirty million people my brain is global and forty five hours of that seventy hours of tv are shows i personally created and not just produced so on top of everything else i need to you know who else is doing that so like i said i 'm a titan i don 't tell you this to impress you i tell you this because i know what you think of when you hear the word writer take me seriously when i talk about working so you 'll get that i don 't peck at a computer and imagine all day so you 'll hear me when i say that i understand that a dream job is not about dreaming it 's all job when i 'm hard at work when i 'm deep in it there is no other feeling it is manning the troops it is painting a canvas it is hitting every high note it is running a marathon it is being beyonc and it is all of those things at the same time there is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets a hum begins in my brain and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road and i could drive it forever it does but the hum it wasn 't until i started making television that i started working working and making and building and creating and collaborating that i discovered this thing and when you have a hum like that you can 't help but strive for greatness or maybe it 's called being a workaholic i don 't know i just know that and i just know that i love the hum the more history stares the more expectations the more i need to work and then the hum stopped overdone burned out the hum stopped now my three daughters harper tells people my mom won 't be there but you can text my nanny i 'm wanting to go to shondaland they 're children of a titan they 're baby titans they were twelve three the hum of the engine died i stopped loving work i couldn 't restart the engine the hum would not come back my hum i was doing the same things i always did all the same titan work 15 hour days working straight through the weekends no regrets never surrender a titan never sleeps a titan never quits full hearts clear eyes i was the perfect titan i was a titan you could take home to your mother and it was my life so what do you do when the thing you do the work you love starts to taste like dust now i know somebody 's out there thinking cry me a river stupid writer titan lady but you know if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum when the hum stops and then my southern waitress toddler asks me a question wanna play and i 'm just about to say no when i realize two things one i 'm supposed to say yes to everything and two my southern waitress didn 't call me she 's not calling everyone honey anymore being a titan and mourning my hum and here she is changing right before my eyes wanna play and i say yes there 's nothing special about it we play and we 're joined by her sisters and there 's a lot of laughing and i give a dramatic reading from the book everybody poops nothing out of the ordinary it is extraordinary because in my pain and my panic in the homelessness of my humlessness i have nothing to do but pay attention i focus i am still the nation i 'm the marathon i 'm running the troops the canvas the high note does not exist all that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that frozen girl needs to let go of it 's all peace and simplicity the air is so rare in this place for me that i can barely breathe i can barely believe i 'm breathing play is the opposite of work and i am happy something in me loosens a door in my brain swings open it does happen i feel it a hum creeps back not at full volume barely there it 's quiet and i have to stay very still to hear it but it is there not the hum it 's just love that 's all it is no secret it 's just love it 's just something we forgot if i have to ask if i have to tell you who i am if i describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is i have forgotten what the real hum is the hum is not power and the hum is not we could all use a little more love love a lot more love and i don 't have a choice not if i want to feel the hum i 'm not interested in doing it the way i 'm interested in doing work the truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face i don 't like playing i work all the time because i like working i like working more than i like being at home facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle because what kind of person i 've got issues laughter and one of those issues isn 't that i am too relaxed we run around the yard up and back and up and back we sing show tunes we play with balls and i feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time my tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up i you know why because you 're not rihanna and you 're not a muppet your child does not think you 're that interesting you only need fifteen minutes my two and four year old only ever want to play with me for about fifteen minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else it 's an amazing fifteen minutes but it 's fifteen minutes if i 'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy i 'm invisible after fifteen minutes i can get a 13 year old to talk to me for fifteen minutes i 'm parent of the year fifteen minutes is all you need i can totally pull off fifteen minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day no cell phone no laundry no anything you have a busy life you have to get dinner on the table you have to force them to bathe but you can do fifteen minutes the fuel that feeds your hum the place where life feels more good than not good it it 's about playing in general give yourself the fifteen minutes find what makes you feel good just figure it out and play in that arena seeing friends reading books staring into space wanna play starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways i 'd given up on right around the time i got my first tv show right around the time i became a right around the time i started competing with myself for ways unknown turns out nothing the very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return as if the hum 's engine could only refuel while i was away but after a few months and i find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody full on groove inside me and around me and it sends me spinning with ideas and the humming road is open and i can drive it and drive it and i love working again but now i am that hum and i don 't give a crap about being a titan because i have never once seen a titan play red rover red rover the more i play the real thank you"
