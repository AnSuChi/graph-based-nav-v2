  "transcript": "want to alarm anybody in this room but it 's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar we 're all liars what i 'm going to do today is i 'm going to show you what the research says about why we 're all liars how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking and ultimately to trust building now speaking of trust ever since i i can 't even get a coffee date at starbucks maybe you could have focused on cooking how about french cooking so before i get started what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to clarify my goal for you liespotters aren 't those nitpicky kids those kids in the back of the room that are shouting gotcha gotcha your eyebrow twitched you flared your nostril i watch that tv show ' lie to me ' i know you 're lying no and they start up that path by accepting a core proposition lying is a cooperative act so i know it may sound like tough love but look if at some point you got lied to it 's because you agreed to get lied to truth number one about lying lying 's a cooperative act now sometimes we 're willing participants we say nice song honey you don 't look fat in that no so sorry but there are times when we are are unwilling participants in deception and that can have dramatic costs for us last year saw nine hundred and ninety seven billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the united states madoff the mortgage they can undermine democracy they can cause the deaths of those that defend us deception is actually serious business british authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the western he said look everyone is willing to give you something they 're ready to give you something for whatever it is they 're hungry for and that 's the crux of it if you don 't want to be deceived you have to know what is it that you 're hungry for and we all kind of hate to admit it we wish we were better husbands better wives smarter more powerful taller richer the list goes on lying is an attempt to bridge that gap but in another study it showed that strangers lied three times within the first ten minutes of meeting each other now but if you look more closely the plot actually thickens extroverts lie more than introverts men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people women lie more to protect other people if you 're an average married couple you 're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every ten interactions now you may think that 's bad if you 're unmarried that number drops to three it 's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives we 're deeply we parse it out on an as needed basis sometimes for very very good reasons other times but we 're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries it 's as old as breathing it 's part of our culture it 's part of our history think dante shakespeare the bible news of the world now you might remember koko does anybody remember koko the gorilla who was taught koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall wait to see who 's coming and then go right back by the time you enter college you 're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions by the time we enter this work world and we 're breadwinners we enter a world that is just cluttered with spam ponzi schemers a deception epidemic in short what one author calls a it 's been very confusing for a long time now well there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass trained liespotters get to the truth ninety percent of the time the rest why is it so easy to learn we all use the same techniques so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to show you two patterns of deception and then we 're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves we 're going to start with speech not have sexual relations with that woman and these allegations are false and i need to go back to work for the american people we also heard distancing language that woman using language as their tool now if bill clinton had said well to now if he had repeated the question in its entirety or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail freud had it right freud said look there 's much more to it than speech i 'm going to show you dominique strauss kahn with obama who 's chattering with his fingertips now this brings us to our next pattern which is body language we think we think warmth and smiles convey honesty sincerity a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away can you all spot the fake smile here you can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks the crow 's feet of the eyes they cannot be consciously contracted especially if you overdid the botox don 't overdo nobody will think you 're honest attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators an honest person they 're going to be enthusiastic they 're going to be willing and provide details they 're going to say hey maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks they 're and if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict now let 's say you 're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive that person may be withdrawn look down lower their voice pause be kind of herky jerky ask a deceptive person to tell their story they 're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places and then they 're going to tell their story in strict chronological order and what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways and then they 'll watch them squirm and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive we rehearse our words but we rarely rehearse our gestures we say yes we shake our heads convincing stories we slightly shrug our shoulders we commit terrible crimes and we smile at the delight in getting away with it now that smile is known in the trade as duping delight and we 're going to see that in several videos moving forward but we 're going to start for those of you who don 't know him this is presidential candidate john edwards who shocked america by fathering a child out of wedlock we 're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test see now if you can spot him saying yes while shaking his head no slightly shrugging his shoulders john edwards i 'd be happy to participate in one i know that it 's not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events so i know it 's not possible happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen interviewer are you going to do that soon there are going to be times when someone makes one expression and we 're not all going to become facial expression it 's associated with moral superiority and for that reason it 's very whether or not deception follows and it doesn 't always follow look the other way go the other direction reconsider the deal say no thank you i 'm not coming up for just one more nightcap thank you we know for example we know liars they will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them they 'll alter their vocal tone often making their vocal tone much lower these behaviors they 're red flags we 're human beings we make deceptive ask some hard questions get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing walk into curiosity mode ask more questions treat the person you 're talking to with rapport don 't try to be like those folks on law & order and those other tv shows that pummel their subjects into submission don 't be too aggressive it doesn 't work but i 'm going to show you two videos two mothers one is lying one is telling the truth and these were surfaced by researcher david matsumoto in california and i think they 're an excellent example of what the truth looks like she can 't even pretend to be an agonizing mother what you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very very cool demeanor and if you look closely you 'll see duping delight and that maybe it 'll fade too with time but i don 't think so that bothers me the most now i 'm going to show you a video of an actual erin runnion confronting her daughter 's murderer and torturer in court here you 're going to see no false emotion just the authentic expression of a mother 's agony erin runnion and you hurt her and you crushed her and i know she and you still and i never will pm now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing we know for example that we now have but you 've got to ask yourself in the meantime who do you want on your side of the meeting someone who 's trained in getting to the truth or some guy who 's going to drag a liespotters they know as someone once said character 's who you are in the dark and what 's kind of interesting is that today we have so little darkness our world is lit up twenty four hours a day it 's transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public it 's a much more noisy world so one challenge we have is to remember that 's not honesty our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency character integrity that 's still what matters that 's what 's going to matter so in this much noisier world it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code when you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking listening you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie my going to be an honest one my world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized and when you do that the ground around you starts to shift and that 's the truth"
