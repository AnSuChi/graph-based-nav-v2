  "transcript": "military service member deployed to afghanistan incoming mortar rounds are exploding all around you conscious but dazed by the blasts you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened as you regain your vision you see a bloody face staring but you quickly come to understand it 's not real you give the vision a name secretly haunting you for the next seven years now close your eyes can you see i 've never been a stranger to it when i was a little girl i would visit my grandparents every summer it was my grandfather who introduced me to the effects of combat on the psyche my grandfather was serving as a marine in the korean war a bullet pierced his neck and rendered him unable to cry out and then leaving him to die years later after his physical wounds had healed and he 'd returned home he rarely spoke of his experiences in waking life but at night i would hear him shouting obscenities from his room down the hall and during the day i would announce myself as i entered the room careful not to startle or agitate him he lived out the remainder of his days isolated and tight lipped never finding a way to express himself and i didn 't yet have the tools to guide him i wouldn 't have a name for my grandfather 's condition until i was in my 20s i naturally gravitated towards the study of trauma and while sitting in class learning about post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd for short my mission to help service members who suffered like my grandfather began to take form and while i was pursuing my degree a new war was raging and this pushed military doctors and researchers to try and truly understand the effects that traumatic brain injury due to advances in technology and neuroimaging we now know there 's an actual shutdown in the broca 's or the speech language area of the brain after an individual experiences trauma this physiological change or speechless terror as it 's often called possibly even removed from their current duties has led to the invisible struggles of our servicemen and women i had my work cut out for me when i got my first job as an art therapist at the nation 's largest military medical center walter reed after working for a few years on a locked in patient psychiatric unit i eventually transferred to the national intrepid center of excellence nicoe which leads tbi care for active duty service members big tough strong manly military men and some women too to give art making as a and every work of art tells a story we 've observed that the process of art therapy bypasses the speech language issue with the brain art making accesses the same sensory areas of the brain that encode trauma can use the art making to work through their experiences in a nonthreatening way reintegrating the left and the right hemispheres of the brain now we 've seen this can work with all forms of art painting collage but what seems to have the most impact is finally these invisible wounds don 't just have a name they have a face literally with their trauma and it 's amazing how often that enables them to break through the trauma and initially it was a daunting process for the service member but eventually he began to think of bfib as the mask not his internal wound and he would go to leave each session he would hand me the mask and bfib behind and both times bfib was smiling and the service member didn 't feel anxious now whenever that service member is haunted by some traumatic memory he continues to paint every time he paints these disturbing images them less or not at all now science is showing us that the part of the brain that registers a traumatic wound and art therapy is showing us how to make that connection and this is what he had to say service member you and for me it just released so i was able to and then when i looked at it after two days i mean from there my treatment just when explain this and because it and it allowed me to put of ptsd and sorry melissa walker over the past five years we 've had over one thousand masks made it 's pretty i wish i could have shared this process with my grandfather but i know that he would be thrilled and finding the resources within them thank you"
