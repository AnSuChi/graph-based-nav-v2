  "transcript": "i was living in a tiny house behind someone else 's house in los angeles it was this guest house it had and one night i was sitting there and i but no one was there except my two dogs and they were just chewing their feet but the feeling just kept getting worse and i started to feel this but it started to sink lower and lower and over the course of that week this feeling got worse and worse and i started to become convinced that something was there and i started to hear these sounds this whoosh kind of whisper like something passing through me i think you just need to do a cleansing ritual get some sage and burn it and tell it to go away so i said ok and waved it about and said go away i live here you don because and i probably just look like this impotent powerless thing that couldn 't get it to go away so every day i 'd come home and you guys this feeling got and the feeling and and she wouldn 't just because i and i googled hauntings and i came upon this forum of ghost hunters but these were a special kind of ghost hunters they were skeptics and i was like i would love to hear it and one of them said ok um have you heard of carbon monoxide poisoning leak leaking into your home i looked it up and the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning auditory hallucinations whoosh so that night i called the gas company i said i have an emergency i need you to come out i don 't want to get into the story now but i need you to come out they came out i said i suspect a gas leak because you could have been dead very soon and i wonder how many of them have been in one i 'm an investigator and i 'm an investigator in two senses i 'm an investigative and that means a few things sometimes that means that i 'm pretending to need an exorcism so i can get yes that 's right so i can go to an exorcist and see if he 's using gimmicks or psychological tricks to try to convince someone that they 're possessed sometimes that means i 'm going undercover in a fringe group which i report on for a podcast that i i 've done over seventy investigations like this with my co host ross i would love to tell you that nine times out of ten science wins saves the day it 's the truth is ten times out of ten science wins it saves the day i believe there are two kinds of truth so if you say to me there was a man named jesus and he once existed it does seem to be true because he physically rose or he didn 't i 'm not going to get into whether he rose or he didn 't but i would say that 's an outer truth claim it happened or it didn 't happen and that metaphor and i 'm not going to try to persuade you of it and i think we have a tendency to not be clear about this to try to move our inner truths to outer truths or to not be fair about it to each other and when people are telling us their inner truths to try to make them defend them by 'm talking here about outer truth about objective things i doubt a single person here would be like i still think there was a ghost too we know to give up the ghost we use these things as we believe them because of a lack of evidence so there is a group in los angeles called the independent investigations group or the iig and they do great work they 'll give under scientific but and they had one person so they set up a test with him then they test it it 's very important that both sides agree you know what it matched up about the same as chance looks like you don 't have the power and that gave them the opportunity to compassionately sit down with him and have and what that means is you do hear something in your head and that guy got to make the very difficult decision but really the decision about whether to go get help we 're actually helping people help draw us into reality because there 's this idea that you can 't respect when we jiggle the lock when we test the claim we 're saying ok i respect you i 'm listening to what you 're saying i 'm going to test it out with you we 've all had that experience where you 're telling someone something and oh that 's really interesting yeah you know you 're being had but when someone says really huh sounds a little sketchy to me and that 's the kind of attitude we should have with these claims that 's showing someone that you care what they 're saying most of these searches will come up but we don 't stop looking for two reasons because number one the answer matters whether it 's looking at the afterlife or the paranormal or the cure for cancer it all amounts to the same question how long will we be here because looking for the truth being open minded and being willing to be wrong and to change your whole worldview is i still get excited at ghost stories every single time i still consider that every group i join might be right and i hope i never lose that hope let 's all never lose that hope because searching for what 's out there and also please have a carbon monoxide detector in your"
