  "transcript": "that 's what i have behind myself but of course what we have to remember is this so what i 'm going to try to do in the next seventeen and a half minutes is i 'm going to talk first about the flames where we are in the economy and then i 'm going to take three trends that have taken place at ted over the last twenty five years and i will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like those three trends are the ability to engineer cells and somehow it will all make sense and the problem with a normal commercial bank has nine to ten times leverage that means for every dollar you deposit it loans out about nine or ten and your friendly citibank had so what do banks have in store for you now it ain 't pretty but the problem with santa clause is if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks it turned out that in percent was mandatory spending except we 've been so busy giving away a trillion here a trillion there that we 've brought that date of reckoning forward it turns out santa isn 't quite as cute when it 's summertime this guy runs the china investment corporation he is the main buyer of u s treasury bonds and he gave an interview in december here 's his first bit of advice and by the way chinese prime minister reiterated this at davos last sunday this stuff is getting serious enough that if we don 't start paying attention to the deficit we 're going to end up losing the dollar and then all bets are off let me show you what it looks like i think i can safely say this is an actual bill the only problem with this bill is it 's not really worth very much so the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep and sometimes this creature 's called chrysler and sometimes ford and sometimes whatever you want you 've just got to say no and you 've got to start banishing a word that 's called entitlement everything else is mandated it makes no difference if if you 're fifty to sixty we want you to work two years they got it at sixty five and were expected to check out at we 've got to limit other mandatory and we 've got to end up with a smaller government and if we don 't start changing this trend line we are going to lose the dollar and start to look like iceland this is going to happen but let me remind you this december it did snow in vegas here 's what happens if you don 't address this stuff so japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late ' 80s we don 't fix this now how would you like to see a dow three thousand five we 'd better deal with this stuff that 's the short term that 's the flame part that 's the financial crisis and what 's really important in this stuff is as we cut we also have to grow among other things because startup companies are 02 percent of u s gdp investmentm and they 're about seventeen point eight percent of output so let 's bring a romance novelist into this conversation the ability to engineer tissues and the ability to engineer robots and let me recap some of the stuff you 've seen craig venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware where you can insert dna and have it boot up as a different species in parallel the folks at mit have been building a standard registry of biological parts so think of it as a radio shack for biology you can go out and get your proteins your rna your dna whatever and start building stuff in two thousand and six they brought together high school students and college students and started to build these little odd creatures they just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards here was one of the first things they built graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in and you could tell very easily when your experiment the team from rice university started to engineer so you take resveratrol and you put it there is a god laughter the team from taiwan was a little bit more ambitious they tried to engineer bacterias in such a way that they would act as your kidneys i showed you this picture and that was very cool stuff back then but now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering let me show you what 's happened in that period of time two years ago you saw this creature an almost extinct animal from xochimilco mexico called an axolotl that can re generate its limbs you can freeze half it regrows it 's almost like leaving congress but now you don 't have to have the animal itself to regenerate and of course if you can build mice molars in petri dishes you can born with no teeth you give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth they don 't regrow unless if you 're a lawyer but of course for most of us put them on a biodegradable mold and we can do it with other things so a spanish woman who was dying of t b this is going on in tony atala 's lab in wake forest where he so there are now nine women walking around boston which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life this is kind of getting boring right i mean you understand where this story 's going life happens and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells last year and all we 've got is a roomba we also thought we 'd have this robot to warn us of danger didn 't happen and these were robots engineered for a flat world right so rosie runs around on skates which is why the robot 's we 're designing today are a little different this is boston dynamics ' bigdog and this is about as close as you can get to a physical turing test o k and when you don 't know if that thing is human or animal that 's when computers have reached human intelligence this is not an intelligence turing rest but this is as close as you can get to a physical turing test and this stuff is moving very quickly and by the way that thing can carry about three hundred and fifty pounds of weight the size of flies that are being made by robert wood at harvard you 've got stickybots that are being made at stanford as you bring these things together as you bring you begin to get some really odd questions this gentleman who had several world records in the special olympics tried to run in the normal olympics the only issue with oscar pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs but didn 't qualify by time and as you bring these trends together and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf who can now begin to hear i mean the evolution of hearing aids right i mean your grandparents had these great big and now you have cochlear implants that go into people 's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear now they can 't hear as well as you and i can and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can they 'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing or how whales talk or how dogs talk and and the same thing is happening and then they 'll be able to see color and then they 'll be able to see in definition and one day they 'll see as well as you and i can and a couple of years after that they 'll be able to see in ultraviolet they 'll be able to see in infrared they 'll be able to focus their eyes they 'll be able to 'll do stuff you and i can 't do and it 's a particularly important thing to understand as we worry about the flames of the present to keep an eye on the future and of course the future is looking back two hundred years because next week is the 200th anniversary of darwin 's birth and darwin of course argued that evolution is a natural state it is a natural state in everything that is alive including hominids there have actually been twenty two species of hominids that have been around have evolved have wandered in different places have it is common for hominids and that 's the reason why as you look at the hominid fossil record erectus and and as you think of the and then you got hominids about zero point zero zero six billion years and then you got our version of hominids about zero point zero zero one five billion years ago ta dah and all the galaxies and all the planets and all the energy and all the dark energy and all the rest of stuff maybe not that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint if that 's not the purpose of the universe then what 's next laughter i think we 're going to move from a homo sapiens into a homo evolutis and i think this isn 't one thousand years out i think most of us are going to glance at it and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it and a homo evolutis brings together these three trends into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his species her species and other species and that of course would be the ultimate reboot"
