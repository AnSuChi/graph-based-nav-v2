  "transcript": "the news does not look good this is him on the screen it paralyzes you it starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord this has actually been to me a gift because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life and even though steven away three years ago we had an amazing journey as a family we did not even i think adversity is not even the right word we looked at this and we said we 're going to to do something with this in an incredibly positive way and i want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do which was to this is the story of my brother but it 's just a story and i want to go beyond the story and go to something more and how do i get there is what we are here to do in medicine is what everyone should do and those questions all have variables to them all of our statuses are different what we want to accomplish is different and our paths will be different they are all stories but it 's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do this concept we had was to take steven 's status what is my status and go from this concept of walking and then his hands speak and ultimately happiness and function because steven despite the fact that he was paralyzed as he was in that pool he could not walk he could not use his arms that 's why he had the little floaty things on them did you see those he was happy we were at the beach he was raising his son and we took this and we converted it into data got all the women amazing guy and he could still hold his wife 's hand but he couldn 't do buttons on his clothes can 't feed and here he is paralyzed completely unable to breathe and move over this time journey these stories of his life converted to data he renovated my carriage house when he was completely paralyzed and unable to speak and unable to breathe and he won an award for a historic restoration the thing that we are excited about because we have gone away from the community that we are the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other and we convert that information into this structure this understanding this ability to convert those stories into something that is computable to which we can begin to change the way medicine is done and delivered the company that myself my youngest brother and a good friend from mit here are the actual patients there are forty five thousand of them now sharing their stories as data here is an m s patient and he is uniformly impaired on cognition vision walking sensation hiv als depression look at this hiv patient down here zinny it 's two years of this disease all of the symptoms are not there but he is working to keep his i love some of these physical exercise prayer anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something let 's 's look at prayer what i love about this just sort of interesting design problems these are why people pray here is the schedule of how frequently they it 's a dose so anyone want to see the thirty two patients that pray for sixty minutes a day and see if they 're doing better they probably are here they are everybody is sharing we can see it all or how they treat it and you can drill down and see the individuals this amazing data i want to talk to the fifty eight patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day and to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years so you can see the duration all open all available i 'm going to log in and this is my brother 's profile and this is a new version of our platform we 're launching right now this is the second generation it 's going to be in flash and you can see here as this animates over steven 's data against the background of all other patients against this information the blue band is the 50th percentile steven is the 75th percentile that he but more than that in the new version i can look at this interactively wait poor spinal capacity doesn 't this remind you of a great which was you can adjust the time scale you can adjust the symptoms you can look at the interaction between how i treat my als so you click down on the als tab there i can see magnesium citrate and the side effects from that drug all integrated in the time in which they 're meaningful i want to take this data and make something even better i want my brother 's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs things that interact among those the side effects to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what put the symptoms in the left the drugs across the top tell me everything we know about steven and everyone else and what interacts including some positive side effects that came from other drugs were making his constipation worse and if anyone 's ever had severe constipation and you don 't understand how much of an impact that has on your life yes that was a pun you 're trying to manage and we worked hard and we thought about it and we said what 's something we can use all all the time that we can in the medical care system that everyone will understand because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network it doctors actually love this sheet and they 're actually really engaged so we went from this story of steven and his history to data and then back to paper where we went back and engaged the medical care system and here 's another paper this is a journal this is a report about a drug called lithium lithium that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder that a group in italy found slowed als down in sixteen patients and published it you know we said we looked at this and what i love also is that people always accuse these internet sites of of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly so this is what happened when pnas published this ten percent and they call the internet irresponsible we let them track their blood levels we let them share the data and exchange it and they said you know you don 't have the blinding you don 't have data it doesn 't follow the scientific method it 's never going to work you can 't do it i bought a mac about two years ago i converted over and i was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in leopard and we said except instead of going backwards we go forwards can we find out what 's going to happen to you so that you can maybe change it so we did we took all the patients like humberto that 's the apple background we stole that because we didn 't have time to build our own this and we bring their histories into it and then we say well how do we line them all up so we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points integrated across everything we know about the patient full information and it works almost every time now the ones that it doesn 't work are interesting but almost all the time it works it 's we couldn 't run a clinical trial we couldn 't figure it out but we could see whether it was going to work for clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation we 'll do that later but here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take you can see here the blue dots on the top the light ones those are the people in that you wanted to be on and the red ones are the ones the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn 't want to be and the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero terrifyingly accurate matching and going forward actually don 't want to be a lithium patient this time you 're actually doing slightly worse not significantly a lot of people dropped out the trial there is too much drop out can we do the even harder thing can we go to the patients that actually decided to stay on lithium because they were so convinced they were getting better we asked our control algorithm are those sixty nine patients by the way you 'll notice that 's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial can we look at those patients and say can we match them with our time machine to the other and what happens those little lines that 's the power so we i can 't tell you lithium doesn 't work i can 't tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper i can tell you that for those sixty nine people that took lithium they didn 't do any better than the people that were just like them just like me and announced it so remember i told you about my brother 's stem cell transplant i never really knew whether it worked and i put one hundred million cells in his cisterna magna in his lumbar cord and irbs and did all this work and i never really knew i actually asked tim who is the quant in our group we actually searched for about a year to find someone who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling in couldn 't find anybody so we went to the finance industry and there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates and all that kind of stuff and some of them were available so we hired one we hired them set them up assisting at lab i i m him things that 's the way i communicate with him is like a little guy in a box can you tell me whether my brother 's stem cell transplant worked or not and he sent me this two but it only works about twelve months it 's the first version of the time machine first time we ever tried it we 'll try to get it better later but and you know i look at this you can drill in all the controls you can look at them you can ask them and i found a woman that had and and i am thankful help us answer this question"
