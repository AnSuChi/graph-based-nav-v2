  "transcript": "my family had moved from fort lee new jersey to california from the snow to lots of heat and gas lines there was gas rationing the energy crisis was in full and i got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis and this was a company where i built parabolas and i remember walking into metal shop building parabolas and stirling engines and i was building a stirling engine over on the lathe and all the motorcycle guys said you 're building a bong aren 't you and i said no it 's a stirling engine but they didn 't believe me i sold the plans for this and at my first year at caltech i continued the business and i got addicted to the and then i started idealab so i could have a roof under which i could build multiple companies in succession much later in two thousand very recently the new california energy crisis what was purported to be a big energy crisis was coming and i was trying to figure out if we could build something that ' worth of backup power i 'm glad you heard earlier today batteries are unbelievably lack density compared to fuel so much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries you 'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space i tried to figure out maybe solar 's become attractive it 's been twenty five years since i was doing this let me go back and look at what 's been happening with solar cells and the price had gone down from ten dollars a watt to and it needed to get much lower to be cost effective i studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells and was looking for ways we could make solar cells more inexpensively a lot of new things are happening to do that but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy some people say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life if we reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells that will become more practical but right now you pretty much have to take silicon put it in an oven at one thousand six hundred f for seventeen hours to make the cells a lot of people are working to try and reduce what if we collect the sun with a large reflector like i had been thinking but maybe with modern technology we could make it cheaper and then the conversion device wouldn 't have to be as expensive because it 's much smaller rather than solar cells which have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from this seemed practical now because a lot of new technologies had come in the twenty five years since i had last looked at it there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques not to mention really cheap miniature motors brushless motors servomotors stepper motors that are used in printers and scanners of course inexpensive microprocessors and a very important breakthrough genetic algorithms i 'll be very short on genetic algorithms it 's a powerful way of solving intractable problems you add sex where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations and you use natural selection to kill off solutions usually with a genetic algorithm on a computer today with a three gigahertz processor so we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator and i 'll show you what we came up with traditionally concentrators look like this those shapes are parabolas they have to track the sun so we tried to come up with a so we created a genetic algorithm to try this out we made a model in excel of a multisurface reflector and an amazing from trying a billion cycles a billion different attempts but if the sun is off axis and comes from the so for direct light it takes only one bounce for off axis light it might take two and for extreme off axis it might take three but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle so about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though on an average adjusted day a solar cell because the sun 's moving across the sky so even this although it was great with no moving parts so what you see here is twelve separate petals that each could be controlled with individual you can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now and you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes so we can control all twelve of these petals for under fifty dollars and what this would allow us to do is not have to move the focus any more but only move the petals the whole system would have a much lower profile but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours james watt didn 't actually invent the steam but they 're usually good to be large so they 're not good for distributed power generation they 're also very high pressure so they 're dangerous another type of engine is the hot air engine and the hot air engine also was not invented by robert stirling but robert stirling came along in one thousand eight hundred and sixteen and radically improved it this engine because it was so interesting it only worked on air no steam he just refined it he showed it in paris in one thousand eight hundred and sixty seven and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up you could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications so once you have mobility you 're making a lot of engines because you 've got lots of units as this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn 't so because it went into mass production costs were reduced one hundred years of refinement emissions were reduced so after looking at these three and forty seven others we concluded that the stirling engine would be the so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way because it was practical weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around but if you 're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn 't matter so much we also discovered that efficiency doesn 't matter so much if your energy source is so using that new twist with the new criteria we thought we could relook at the stirling so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to the simplest heat engine or hot air engine of all time would be this take a box a steel canister with a piston put a flame under it the piston moves up take it off the flame and pour water on it or let it cool down the piston moves down that 's a heat engine that 's the most fundamental heat engine you could have the problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent you 're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you 're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end the air which was well i 'm still not heating the metal now with this i 'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time what about if i put a thermal sponge in the middle in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold and then we applied the genetic algorithm we got the results from that for the optimal engine we built engines so we built one hundred different engines over the last two years we measured each one we readjusted the model to what we measured and then we led that to the current prototype so this is the engine it 's and it 's the hot cap the hot cylinder on the top this part gets hot this part is cool comes out the exact converse is also true if you put electricity in so it 's a complete reversible cycle a very efficient cycle and quite a simple thing to make so you have the engine what if you combine the petals and the engine in the center the petals track and the engine and now i want to show you what the actual thing looks like there are thermocouples on the engine little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it when the sun comes out in the morning the petals will seek the sun find it by searching for the highest temperature about a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day six and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky so you don 't have to tell what latitude longitude you 're at what your roof slope angle is a day later a month later it basically figures out where so you don 't have to actually enter anything about that we have so that could be used for certain applications we have an inverter in there so you get one hundred and seventeen volts ac let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running and what they do is step and the engine will start we 've been working on this for the last two years we 're very excited about the progress we have a long way to go though this is how we envision it would be in a residential installation you 'd probably have more than one unit on your roof it could be on your roof your backyard or somewhere else so you 're still using the grid potentially in this type of application to be your backup supply of but by reducing your energy use pretty much at the peak times usually when you have your air conditioning on or other times like that we also think there 's very big potential for energy farms especially in remote land where there happens to be a lot of sun it 's a really good combination of those two factors it turns out there 's a lot of powerful sun all around the world obviously but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these so an example of that is here 's the map of the united states pretty much everywhere that 's not green or blue is a really but the hot spot right around las vegas and death valley then the question of payback is a different one entirely it 's just how many watts do you get per dollar and how could you benefit from that to change your life in some way this is the map of the whole earth look at africa the potential to take advantage of solar energy there is unbelievable and i 'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that so in conclusion i would say my journey we believe we 're getting very close to something practical and affordable our short term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells and our longer term goal is to be so you don 't have to just have a feel good attitude about energy to want to have one of these it just makes economic sense right now solar paybacks are between thirty and fifty years if you get it down below five years then it 's almost a no brainer because the interest to own it so that 's our real powerful goal that we 're really shooting for in the company two other things that i learned that were very surprising to me one was i was walking from the elevator over here and even just looking at the stage right now lights right now there 's ten thousand watts of light pouring on the stage one horsepower is seven hundred and forty six watts at full power so there 's basically fifteen horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit not to mention the two hundred horses that are probably running right now to keep the air conditioning going walk in the elevator and there 's lights on in the elevator of course now i 'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by oil is solar energy concentrate it 's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it and we don 't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are i think and it would be great if we could and i really hope we can get there"
