  "transcript": "here 's a startling fact the number of human bank tellers employed in the united states has roughly doubled from about a quarter of a million to a half a million these facts revealed in a recent book by boston university economist james bessen raise an intriguing question what are all those tellers doing and why hasn 't automation eliminated their employment by now assembly lines were engineered to replace computers were programmed inconsistent human calculation with digital perfection the fraction of us adults employed in the labor market is higher now in two thousand and sixteen than it was one hundred and twenty five years ago in and it 's risen in just about every decade in the intervening one hundred and twenty five years why are there still so many jobs and along the way i 'm going to tell you what this means for the future of work and the challenges that automation does why are there so many jobs there are actually two fundamental economic principles at stake the other has to do with human o ring principle and it determines the type of work that we do the second principle is the never get enough principle and it determines how many jobs there actually are let 's start with the automated teller machines had two countervailing effects on bank teller employment as you would expect they replaced a lot of teller tasks the number of tellers per branch fell by about a third but those tellers were doing somewhat different work as their routine cash handling tasks receded they became less like checkout clerks and more like salespeople there 's a general principle here most of the work that we do requires a multiplicity of skills and technical let me give you a stark example in one thousand nine hundred and the space shuttle challenger exploded and o ring in the booster rocket that had frozen on the launchpad the night before and o ring made the difference between mission success and the calamitous death of seven astronauts o ring production function named by harvard economist michael kremer after the challenger disaster every one of those links must hold for the mission to succeed if any of them fails comes crashing down this precarious situation has a surprisingly positive implication which is that improvements in the reliability of any one link in the chain increases the value of improving any of the other links probably something else will break anyway but as all the other links become robust and reliable the importance of your link becomes more essential in the limit everything depends upon it the reason the o ring was critical to space shuttle challenger is because everything else worked perfectly if the challenger were kind of the space era equivalent of microsoft windows two thousand reliability of the o ring wouldn 't have mattered because the machine would have crashed o rings it increased the importance of their the same principle applies if we 're building a building if we 're diagnosing and caring for a patient or if we are teaching a class to a roomful of high schoolers technology magnifies our leverage and increases the importance of our expertise and our judgment and our creativity o ring got it that says the jobs that people do will be important they can 't be done by machines but they still need to be done but that doesn 't tell me how many jobs there will need to be isn 't it kind of self evident that once we get sufficiently productive at something we 've basically worked our way out of a job it 's not because we 're eating less a century of productivity growth in farming means that now a couple of million farmers can feed a nation of three hundred and twenty million that 's but what 's true about a single product or service or industry has never been true about the economy as a whole many of the industries in which we now work electronics and computing were tiny or barely existent a century ago many of the products that we spend a lot of our money on air conditioners sport utility vehicles computers and mobile devices were unattainably expensive or just hadn 't been invented a century ago as automation frees our time increases the scope of what is possible we invent new products new ideas new services that command our attention occupy our time and spur consumption adventure tourism pokmon go and i might agree with you but people desire these things and they 're willing to work hard for them the average worker in two thousand and fifteen wanting to attain the average living standard in one but most people don 't choose to do that they are willing to work hard to harvest the technological bounty that is available to them invention is the mother of necessity then you agree with me there will be jobs does that mean there 's nothing to worry about automation employment robots and jobs it 'll all take care of itself no that is not my argument automation creates wealth by allowing us to do more work in less time there is no economic law that says that we will use that wealth well and that is worth worrying about norway and saudi arabia it 's like they have money spurting out of a hole in the ground but they haven 't used that wealth equally well to foster human saudi arabia is an absolute monarchy in which many citizens lack a path for personal advancement it 's typically ranked among nations in happiness which is low for such a wealthy nation just by way of comparison the us is typically ranked around saudi arabia has raised living standards while frustrating many other human strivings both wealthy not equally well off and this brings me to the challenge that we face today the challenge is that many of those jobs are not good jobs and many citizens cannot qualify for the good jobs that are being created employment growth in the united states and in much you jobs like doctors and nurses marketing and sales managers employment is robust in these jobs employment growth similarly employment the reasons behind rules and procedures that can shrinks the size of the middle on the one hand a set of highly paid educated professionals doing interesting work on the other a large number of citizens in low paid jobs whose primary responsibility is to see to the comfort and health of the affluent we have faced the farm states faced a threat of mass unemployment a generation of youth no longer needed on the farm rising to this challenge they took the radical step of requiring that their entire youth population remain in school and continue their education to the ripe old age of sixteen but those kids couldn 't work at their jobs it also turned out to be one of the best investments the us made in the 20th century it gave us the most skilled imagine taking the labor force of despite their strong backs and good characters many of them would lack the basic literacy and numeracy skills to do all but the most mundane mundane jobs many of them would be unemployable if the us had not invested in its schools and in its skills a century ago with the high school movement i started this talk with a paradox our machines increasingly do our work for us why doesn 't that make our labor superfluous our skills redundant isn 't it obvious that the road to our economic and social hell is paved with our own great inventions the first part of the answer is that technology magnifies our leverage increases the importance the added value of our expertise our judgment and our creativity and here is some encouraging news because of our amazing productivity arguably we can 't afford not to maybe the present right is this time different every time is different the luddites these predictions strike me as arrogant then you me and our kids aren 't going to think of it either but the future doesn 't hinge on my imagination if i were a farmer in iowa in the year one thousand nine hundred and an economist from the 21st century teleported down to my field and said hey guess what farmer autor in the next hundred years agricultural employment is going to fall from forty percent of all jobs to two percent purely due to rising productivity what do you think the other thirty eight percent of workers are going to do but i hope i would have had the wisdom to say wow a ninety five percent reduction in farm employment with no shortage of food i hope that humanity finds something remarkable to do with all of that prosperity i would say that it has thank you very much"
