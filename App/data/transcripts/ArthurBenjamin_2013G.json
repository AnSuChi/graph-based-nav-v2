  "transcript": "so why do we learn mathematics and last and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it inspiration mathematics is the science but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated but wouldn 't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply now i know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers the fibonacci numbers from the standpoint of calculation they 're as easy to understand as one plus one which is two indeed the person we call fibonacci was actually named leonardo of pisa and these numbers appear in his book liber abaci which taught the western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today applications fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often the number of petals on a flower is typically a fibonacci number or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a fibonacci number as well and frankly who doesn 't let 's look at the squares of the first few fibonacci numbers so one squared is one two squared is four three squared is nine five squared is twenty five and so on now it 's no surprise that when you but you wouldn 't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together and one plus four gives us five let 's see what we get there so one plus one plus four is six those are not but if you look at them closely you 'll see the fibonacci numbers buried inside of them do who do we appreciate let 's look at that last equation why should the squares of one one i 'll show you by drawing a simple picture we 'll start with a one by one square and next to that put another just as we created it it 's one squared plus one squared that 's the area and the base is five now if we continue this process we 'll generate rectangles of the form thirteen by now check this out if you divide thirteen by eight you get one point six two five and if you divide the larger number by the smaller number then these ratios get now i show all this to you because like so much of mathematics there 's a beautiful side to it that i fear does not get enough attention in our schools we spend lots of time learning about but let 's not forget about application including perhaps the most important application of all learning how to think if i could summarize this in one sentence it would be this mathematics is not just solving for x it 's also figuring out why thank you very much"
