  "transcript": "by raising your hand how many of you know at least one person on the screen wow they are very famous in their fields and do you know what all of them have in common however although it 's very very sad this news it 's also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be especially if you compare it with breast cancer so it doesn 't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer means facing an almost certain death sentence this number hasn 't changed a bit while much more progress has been made with other types so how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective understanding their limitations and trying to find new innovative solutions that can change their outcome but you can barely see it until i remove all the other organs in front it 's also surrounded by many other vital organs like the liver the stomach the bile duct and the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs is the reason why pancreatic cancer is one of the most painful tumor types the hard to reach location also prevents the this brings us to the second piece of bad news pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels let 's think for a second how chemotherapy works the drug is injected in the vein and it navigates throughout the but what if your destination doesn 't have an exit on the highway you will never get there the drugs navigate throughout they will reach the efficacy is very limited research and effort have gone towards finding new powerful drugs to hopefully we are basically we have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one they are flexible enough that they can be so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery they will actually physically prevent the tumor from entering other organs controlling the the metastasis the they start delivering the drug only locally slowly and more effectively than what is done with the current whole body treatment so we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it 's needed the most we allow a response that is twelve times more powerful we are hoping that one day we can reduce their pain extend their life and potentially make pancreatic cancer a curable disease we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions thank you very much"
