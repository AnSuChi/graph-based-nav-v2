  "transcript": "our face let 's not forget it 's a functional entity we have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our it 's where our senses are located our special senses our vision our speech our hearing our smell our taste and this which warm and moisten the air we breathe but also imagine we wouldn 't be able to look at the world around us attached to the facial bones that define our face 's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression our universal language which is a hugely complex three dimensional structure and then nibble the ears maybe it 's the face where we 're attracted to with that but let 's not forget the hair you 're looking at the image on your left hand side that 's my son with his eyebrows present look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing there 's a definite difference and imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose he 'd look even odder still dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we it 's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves and we only see ourselves in freeze frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct they don 't need this they need psychiatric help he looks entirely normal age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes so children by the behavior of adults around them and she 's having difficulty seeing as you can see it 's blocking her vision she 's also our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them they 've grown used to their face they think they 're special actually sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed and occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they 've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don 't recognize them but other adults say incredibly painful things they say how dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people you be doing something about this why haven 't you had it removed and that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature everything normalizes the adults behave more naturally and the children play more readily with other children as teenagers just think back to your teenage years we 're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial we 're trying to struggle to find our identity we crave the approval of our peers so our facial appearance is vital to us as we 're trying to project ourselves to the world just remember that single acne spot that crippled you practicing your sardonic look practicing your serious look trying to look like sean connery as i did trying to raise one eyebrow turn to the person next to you push your lower jaws forward turn to the person next to you and look at them they look miserable that 's exactly what people used to say to wasn 't miserable at all but people used to say to her why are you so miserable people were making misjudgments all the time on her mood she said my face now reflects my personality people know now that i 'm enthusiastic that i 'm a happy person and that 's the change that can be achieved for teenagers is this change though a real change or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves well we studied teenagers ' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery and what we found was we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn 't recognize the before and after what we found was that the patients were regarded friendliness violence they were all perceived as being they were perceived as being more intelligent less violent and yet we hadn 't operated on their intellect or their character their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune what happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma so this is a photograph two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face his cheekbone his upper but over the course of the next fifteen years he had fourteen more operations as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly he continued to play cricket he enjoyed life to the full and this was probably because he had a successful fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially he maintained a calm insouciance i don 't say he overcame this he didn 't overcome it this was something more than that he ignored it and that 's what these people can do henriapi 20s whose first visit out of nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the united kingdom to have operated on it was my longest operation he said this painting of me with my son jeremiah shows me as the successful man that i feel that i am his facial disfigurement so we 've seen that we can change people 's faces but when we change people 's faces are we changing their identity for better or for worse for instance there are two different types of facial surgery we can categorize it like that we can say there are patients they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as as better people they don 't feel different they feel that they 've actually gained and actually that 's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery because you might say well this type of sue wasn 't trying to achieve difference in her life she was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality but then we have other people who don 't choose to have facial surgery they 're people who have their face shot off i 'll move it off and we 'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you and again as i told you if they have a caring family and good work life then they can lead normal fulfilled lives their identity doesn 't change this is a little bangladeshi girl from the east end of london who 's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly after she had surgery to remove the tumor her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress a pink ribbon in her hair we make judgments on people 's faces all the time it 's been going on since we can think of lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces he said you could see criminal faces judging them just on we look at a good looking guy we 'd like to spend time with him he looks friendly now we know and beauty doesn 't equate so we 've talked about the static face and judging the static face but actually we think we can judge people on their expressions u k jurors in the u k justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity the blink the so they want to see live witnesses todorov tells us that in a tenth of a second we can make a judgment on somebody 's face are we uncomfortable with this image yes we are would we be happy if our doctor 's face our lawyer 's face our financial adviser 's face was covered we 'd be pretty uncomfortable but are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement the truth is that there 's a you spend five minutes with somebody you start looking beyond their facial appearance and the people who you 're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them and the people who you didn 't immediately seek out i now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we and that 's what we have to get to this is a horrific image so i 'm putting my hand up now this is a photograph of adi a nigerian bank manager who this is how i looked before we made a model of the jaw without bone in it we then bent a plate up to it we then here you can see the plate holding it and you can see the implants being put in so that in one operation we achieve this so the patient 's life is restored that 's the good news however his chin skin it 's darker and that 's where we need the face transplant the face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin we can replace the underlying skeletal structure but we 're still not good at replacing the facial skin so but the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives or lung transplant it is a quality of life transplant and as a result if they get a malignant cancer ten or fifteen years on i wish i 'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because i 'm now dying of a malignant cancer we don 't know yet we also don 't know bernard devauchelle and sylvie testelin who did the first operation are studying that donors are going to be short on the ground because how many people want to have their loved one 's face removed at the point of death so there are going to be problems with face so the better news is the future 's almost here and the future is tissue engineering just imagine i can put it in place where it 's meant to be i can sprinkle a few cells stem cells from the patient 's own hip a little bit of genetically engineered protein and lo and behold leave it for four months and the face is grown this is a bit like a julia child recipe we 're still not curing enough patients it 's the most disfiguring cancer we 're still not reconstructing them well enough and the best news of all is that surgeons that we need to do research and we 've set up charities that will help us fund let 's leave it as it is thank you very much indeed"
