  "transcript": "or four years old i remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers and i remember putting up my my hands to feel the page of the book to feel the picture they were discussing remember that you can 't see and you can 't feel the picture i want to read little did i know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true little did i know that i was in a country where i could participate in the technological revolution there are but those of us who 've shared in the technological changes mainly come from north america computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world but i think they 've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group and so i want to tell you about the interaction between computer based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person when i was five i went to school and i learned braille it 's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper in fact i think they 're putting up my grade six report i don 't know where julian morrow got that from i was pretty good in reading but religion and musical appreciation needed more work when you leave the opera find there 's braille signage in the lifts look for it have you noticed it i do i look for it all the time when i was at school the books were transcribed by transcribers voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so i 'd have volumes to read and that had been going on mainly by women century in this country but it was the only way i could read and it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers for example when i studied and they read into it as one of them said to me ron we ain 't going anywhere at the moment but think of it these men who hadn 't had the educational opportunities i 'd had helped me gain post graduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help well i went back and became an academic at melbourne 's monash university and twenty five years tape recorders were everything to me in fact in my office students family and friends all read me material mrs lois doery whom i later came to call my surrogate mum read me many thousands of hours onto tape one of the reasons i agreed to give this talk today was that i was hoping that lois would be here so i could introduce you to her and publicly thank her but i thank you here lois from this platform and i thought to myself this thing 's got a glass screen not much use to me how very wrong i was in in the month our eldest son gerard was born i got my first blind computer see it up there and you see it has no what do you call it no screen it 's a blind computer it 's a keynote gold at the time i think there 's more memory in my watch it was invented by russell smith a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people sadly he died in a light plane crash in two thousand and five but his memory lives on in my heart i could read back what i had typed into it it had a speech synthesizer i 'd written my first coauthored labor law book on a typewriter in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine purely from memory even with optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font but by using and and i could use it i didn 't have to be nice to people and i 'm actually too shy now to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material but you know i could pop a book on in the middle of the night the i can keep up with my friends there are many people who have helped me in my life and many that i haven 't met one is another american inventor ted henter but in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight he had a car accident and lost his sight which he then turned to being a he teamed up with bill joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the net or from what was on the computer it 's called jaws job access with speech and it sounds like this i slowed it down for you i 'm going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it can we play that one when you 're marking student essays you want to get through them fairly i grew up with family friends reading to me and i loved the warmth and the breath and the closeness of people reading do you love being read to and one of my to me and the children down near manly beach harry potter and the philosopher 's stone isn 't that a great book i but i wouldn 't give up the technology because it 's allowed me to lead a great life of course talking books for the blind predated all this technology after all the long playing record was developed in the early 1930s and now we put talking books on cds using the digital but i love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice now there are still barriers front of we people with disabilities many websites we can 't read using jaws and the other technologies websites are often very and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren 't labeled and buttons that aren 't labeled and that 's why the world wide web consortium three known as internet users or internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field there are other barriers brought about by our laws australia like about one third of the world 's countries has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled or read for we but those books can 't travel across borders but it 's not legal to transport the books from spain to latin america there are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the united states britain canada australia etc united states and new zealand all had to have separate readings of harry potter and that 's why next month in morocco a meeting is taking place between all the countries it 's something that a group of countries and the world blind union are advocating a cross border treaty so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception we can transport those books across borders and give life to people particularly in developing countries blind people don 't have the books to read i want that to happen my life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage and children and certainly interesting whether it be i 've indeed been a very fortunate human being but i can still remember my mum saying sixty years ago be able to read the print with your fingers i 'm so glad volunteer readers and passionate inventors has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world i 'd like to thank my researcher hannah martin who is my slide clicker who clicks the slides bless you thank you very"
