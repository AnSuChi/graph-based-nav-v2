  "transcript": "i have won medals in three different sports and national games in canada competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent canada on the world stage work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments people like me were shunned and hidden away there has been lots of change since special olympics began in people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population people use the r word in front of me and they think it doesn 't matter that 's the word retard or retarded used in a derogatory i am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities or too often how they don 't see them at all did you know the world games happened this year i was one of over six thousand five hundred athletes with intellectual disabilities from one hundred and sixty five countries who competed in la and there was live coverage on tsn and did you even know that happened what do you think of when you see someone like me i am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals special olympics transforms the self identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching for those of you who aren 't familiar special olympics is separate from the paralympics and olympics we offer year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions and it has changed the way the world sees the older i got and i was angry and frustrated i did not play any sports didn 't have many friends and felt left out and sad there was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were frank hayden a scientist at the university of toronto was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children using rigorous scientific research dr hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer and special olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half i was nervous shy not confident and didn 't have many friends supportive and let me be myself without being judged i am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial national games and this year made it all the way to the world summer games in la where i was part of the first ever canadian basketball team to compete at world games and i 've heard so many similar stories special olympics also addresses critical men with intellectual disabilities die thirteen years younger than men without and women with intellectual disabilities die twenty years younger than women without special olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport special olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care at the two thousand and fifteen world summer games my team canada teammates and i played the nigerian basketball team where seven of ten members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time happy and confident because their coach could vocally communicate with them and they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands sounds that we take for granted special olympics special olympics is transforming their lives off the field research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the us don 't know a single person with an intellectual disability percent of americans who don 't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities then there 's the r word proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people people use it as a casual term or an insult it was tweeted more than nine million times and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes but it is as my fellow athlete and global messenger john franklin stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the an insult come join us someday at special olympics see if you walk away with your heart unchanged hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition the newfoundland moose deadlifted six hundred and fifty five pounds and lifted six hundred and eleven pounds in the squat jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in newfoundland not just special olympics performance few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that sixty thousand spectators filled the famous la memorial coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of world games and cheer athletes from one hundred and special olympics teaches the world great coaches and i am pursuing a career as a personal trainer bullied and i am here doing a ted talk but there is still farther to go i hope you will see their ability i hope you will think about nelson mandela said sports has the power to change the world special olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be thank you very much"
