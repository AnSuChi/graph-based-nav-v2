  "transcript": "i met a young unmarried mother called faiza faiza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception pregnancy and delivery but faiza saved the best for last you know i am a virgin she told me i have two medical certificates to prove it this is the modern middle east where two millennia after the coming of christ virgin births are still a fact of life now i know this might sound like a dream job or possibly a highly dubious occupation but for me it 's something else altogether i 'm half egyptian and i 'm muslim but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots like so many who straddle east and west i 've been drawn over the years to try to better understand my origins aids as a writer and a researcher and an activist sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the middle east and north in politics and economics in religion and tradition in gender and as i found if you really want to know a people you start by looking inside their bedrooms but running across it are three red lines these are topics you are not supposed to challenge in word or deed but the arab spring has changed all that in uprisings which have blossomed across the region since two thousand and eleven old and new continue to cling to business as usual millions are still pushing back that second red line is religion but now religion and politics are connected with the rise of such groups as the muslim brotherhood and some people at least are starting to ask questions about the role of islam in public and private life you know as for that third red line that off limits subject what do you think it might be the only accepted context for sex is marriage sanctioned by religion and registered by the state marriage is your ticket to adulthood if you don 't tie the knot you can 't move out of your parents ' place and you 're not supposed to be having sex and you 're definitely not supposed to be having children 's a social citadel it 's an impregnable fortress which resists and around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex against you name it faiza was living proof of this her virginity statement was not a piece of wishful thinking in a patriarchy boys will be boys men have sex before marriage and people more or less turn a blind eye not so for women who are expected to be virgins on their wedding night that is to and so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve this tiny piece of anatomy from female genital mutilation and so little communication in the family when her condition became hard to hide faiza 's mother helped her flee her father and brothers and so when faiza eventually fetched up at a hospital in casablanca the man who offered to help her there are legions of young men who can 't afford to get married because marriage has become a very expensive proposition but they can 't find jobs there are career women who want to get married but can 't find a husband because they defy gender expectations but the man he is still at the prehistoric stage and then there are men and women who cross the heterosexual line who have sex with their own sex or who have a different gender identity they are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities even their appearance and they face a daily struggle with social stigma with family despair and with religious fire and brimstone now it 's not as if it 's all rosy in the marital bed either but are at a loss of how to achieve it especially wives who are afraid whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution they have been sold by their families now raise your hand if any of this is sounding familiar to you from your part of the world yeah it 's not as if the arab double standards for men and women sex as a source of shame and a vast gulf between appearance and reality what people are doing doing and what they 're willing to admit to and a general reluctance to move beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion everybody talks about it but when your husband reaches out to you when he seizes a part of your body when he penetrates you with his penis try to talk and it might sound that these handy hints come from the joy of sex or youporn but in fact they come from arabic book called the encyclopedia of pleasure sex from going right back to the prophet muhammad there is a rich tradition in islam of talking frankly but also for women position and preference a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body of the woman you see on this page even by educated people who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue but while the west has opened on sex what we found is that arab societies appear to and it is the product of a complex historical process one which has gained ground with the rise of islamic conservatism is what conservatives around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo but what 's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of but history shows us that even as recently as our fathers ' and grandfathers ' day there have been times of greater pragmatism and tolerance and a willingness to consider other interpretations be it abortion or masturbation or even the incendiary topic not black and white as conservatives would have us believe islam offers us at least fifty shades of gray laughter over my travels i 've met men and women across the arab region who 've been exploring that spectrum who are trying to help couples find lesbian gay transgendered transsexual who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real world support women and increasingly men who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home home groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against hiv and other occupational hazards now these efforts are small they 're often underfunded and they face formidable opposition and they and their ideas will gain ground social change doesn 't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation but rather through negotiation but a sexual evolution forging our own path not following one blazed by another i hope will one day lead us to the right to control our own bodies and to access the information and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives the right to express our ideas freely to marry whom we choose to choose our own partners to be sexually active or not to decide whether to have children and when and so much needs to education media the economy the list goes on and on and it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith and my appreciation of local histories and cultures by showing me possibilities challenging the taboos seeking alternatives but at this critical moment in history if we do not privacy and autonomy in our personal lives in our sexual lives and that is true for us thank you"
