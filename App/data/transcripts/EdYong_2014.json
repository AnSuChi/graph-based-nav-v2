  "transcript": "a herd of wildebeests a shoal of fish a flock of birds many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world but the common answers include things like seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs or gathering to mate or breed this is artemia a brine the tapeworm drains nutrients from artemia 's body but it also does it changes their color from transparent to bright red because the tapeworm like many other parasites has a complicated life cycle involving are just one step on its journey its ultimate destination is this the greater flamingo only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce so to get there it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are and that is the secret of the artemia turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo this cricket swallowed the larvae of a gordian worm or horsehair worm the worm grew to adult size it jumps in and drowns and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse crickets are really roomy who knew the tapeworm and the gordian worm are not alone they are part of an entire cavalcade of mind controlling parasites of fungi viruses and worms and insects because after all they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre when you write about parasites your lexicon swells with phrases like devoured alive and bursts out of its but there 's more to it than that i 'm a writer and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories why for example does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over is it maybe protecting its siblings see what i mean the caterpillar didn 't die some of the wasps seemed to stay stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons this caterpillar is a head banging zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it we have a lot to get through i only have thirteen minutes now some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world and that point of view is understandable because by their nature parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things but that doesn 't mean that they aren 't important and what they found were but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds and remember the gordian worm that i showed you the cricket thing one japanese scientist called takuya sato found that in one stream these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some sixty percent of the diet of local trout manipulation is not an oddity it is a critical and common part of the world around us and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators this is and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach when she finds one she stabs it with a stinger that is also a sense organ this discovery came out three weeks ago she and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons it doesn 't kill the roach nor does it sedate it the roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to but it doesn 't choose to allowing her to lead her helpless victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog and once there she lays an egg on it egg hatches devoured alive bursts out of body yadda yadda yadda you know the drill the cockroach isn 't a roach anymore it 's more of an extension of the wasp just like the cricket was an extension of the gordian worm these hosts won 't get to survive or reproduce they have as much control over their own fates as my car and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else 's mind we place such a premium on our free will and our independence that the prospect of losing orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and but in nature they happen all the time which leads me to an obvious sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior without us knowing about it besides the nsa if there are any i 've got a red dot on my forehead now don 't i if there are any this is a good candidate for them this is toxoplasma for short because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname and scientists like joanne webster have shown that if toxo gets into a rat or a mouse it turns the rodent into a cat seeking missile if the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of the cat eats the rat toxo gets to have sex including those involved in sexual arousal but how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear and the same parasites estimates vary a lot but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have toxo in their brains now typically this doesn 't lead to any overt illness the parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long but there 's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people that they have a slightly higher risk of car accidents and there 's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected and i think that this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing they 're constantly inviting to look at the natural world sideways and to ask if the behaviors we 're seeing whether they 're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling are not the results of individuals acting through their and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful and i like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks but perhaps that 's just a parasite talking"
