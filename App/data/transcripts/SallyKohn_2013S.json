  "transcript": "when i do my job people hate me in fact the better i do my job the more people hate me i am a progressive lesbian talking head on fox news so y 'all heard that right just to make sure right i am a gay talking head on fox news i am going to tell you how i do it so i go on television i debate people who literally want to obliterate everything i believe in in some cases who don 't want me and people like me to even exist it 's sort of like thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids with a live television audience of millions it 's totally almost just like that and that 's just on air the hate mail i get is unbelievable last week alone i got two hundred and thirty eight pieces of nasty email i was called an idiot a traitor a scourge a cunt and an ugly man and was just in one email so well my biggest takeaway but what matters more is emotional correctness i care about two things one i care that you spell it right applause just quick refresher it 's and second i don 't care about the word i care about how you use it are you being friendly are you just being naive or do you really want to hurt me personally emotional correctness and what i 've realized is that political persuasion doesn 't begin with ideas or facts or data so when i first went to go work at fox news true confession i expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle dragging that by the way in case you 're paying attention is not emotionally correct we can be self righteous we can be condescending we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn 't agree with us in other words we can be politically right conservatives are really nice sean hannity is one of the sweetest guys i 've ever met and i know that if i ever had a problem now and that 's why people listen to him because you can 't get anyone to agree with you if they don 't even listen to you first we spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements then we have a shot at building common ground but when you try to put it in practice it 's really powerful so someone who says they hate immigrants i try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they 've always known or someone who says they don 't like teachers ' unions i bet they 're really devastated to see their kid 's school going into the gutter and they 're just looking for someone to blame our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us that is emotional correctness i 'm not saying it 's easy an average of like five point six times per day i have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities this whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a but what i am because i don 't just get hate mail lots of them and one of my all time favorites begins i am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic laughter but i 'm a big fan of you as a person now this guy doesn 't agree with me yet he 's listening not because of what i said but because of how i said it and somehow even though we 've never met we 've managed to form a connection thank you"
