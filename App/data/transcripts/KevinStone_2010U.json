  "transcript": "so i tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college and then developed an arthritic knee and i 'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story and by the way i married a so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if i couldn 't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me so with that let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we 're trying to explain narrator we are all aware of the risk of cancer but there 's another disease that 's destined to affect even more of us desperate for a solution we 've turned to shouldn 't we stop and ask if there 's a better more natural way let 's consider an alternative path this is the field of biologic replacements where we replace and so the mission is how do i treat these things biologically and let 's talk about both what i did for my wife and what i 've done for hundreds of other patients first thing for my wife and the most common thing i hear from my patients particularly in the 40 to 80 year old age group 70 year old age group is they come in and say hey doc isn 't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee i 'm not ready for joint replacement and so for her i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that so here 's my wife 's bad knee on the left and her just hiking now four months later in aspen and doing well and it works not just for my wife but certainly for other patients the girl on the video jen hudak just won the superpipe in aspen so with all this success why isn 't that good enough you might ask but the solution is animal tissue because it 's plentiful it 's you can get it from young healthy tissues which is type i collagen strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template we 've now done that procedure and it 's been done worldwide in over four thousand cases so in that case i have to design and we designed with uri galili and tom turek an enzyme wash to wash away or strip those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme and we call that a gal stripping technique what we do is humanize the tissue 's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it and then we can put it back into a patient 's knee and we 've done that now we 've taken pig ligament young healthy big tissue put it into ten patients in an fda approved trial and then one of our patients went on to have three canadian masters downhill so what we 're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young healthy pig strip it of its antigens load it with your stem cells tack it on there have you heal that surface so that 's our biologic approach right now we 're going to rebuild your knee with the parts we 're going to resurface it with a completely new surface we can use thicker younger better tissues than you might have injured in your knee or that you might have when you 're forty fifty or sixty super biologics it 's not hardware it 's not software it 's bioware it 's version two point zero of you and so with that coming to a thank you very much"
