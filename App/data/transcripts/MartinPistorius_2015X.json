  "transcript": "a body that doesn 't respond to wishing you could reach out to connect to comfort to participate for thirteen long years that was my reality i 've thought a lot about it i 've had a lot of time to think for the first twelve years of my life i was a normal happy healthy little boy everything changed and finally my i said to my mother when home having the intelligence of a three month old baby they were told to take me home and try to keep me comfortable until i died my parents in fact my entire family 's lives became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how their friends drifted away the lego blocks and electronic circuits i 'd loved as a boy were put away i but no one realized that i had come back to but i couldn 't find a way to let anybody know totally i would never be rescued i lived in fear and to put it bluntly was waiting i don 't know if it 's truly possible to express in words what it 's like not to be able to communicate stifled and muted within you for me the worst was the feeling of utter i think because barney is so happy and jolly and i absolutely wasn it made it so much worse invisible observer of how people behaved unfortunately i wasn 't only an observer devoid of feelings that people used to play out their darkest desires i was shocked and filled with disbelief i was confused what had i done to deserve this i just never knew when all i they can 't take away my dignity and i thought to myself you want to bet perhaps my parents could have found out and could have i was filled with enormous compassion and love yet i could do nothing about it i remember one particularly low moment a random stranger walked looked at me but that simple act the fleeting moment of human connection transformed how i was feeling making me want to keep going a reality that was often too much to bear alone with my thoughts i constructed intricate fantasies about ants running across the floor i understood how long it would be before i was picked up and taken home seeing my father walk through the door to collect me was the best moment of the day my mind became a tool that i could use to either close down to retreat from my reality or enlarge into a gigantic space that i could fill with fantasies and in my place was the person people expected me to be the vegetable deserving of harsh words dismissal and even abuse to others i was the tragically brain damaged boy who had grown to become a man someone they were kind to and cared for it took someone new to see me in a different way whether through intuition or her attention to details that others failed to notice she became convinced that i could understand what was being said i was beginning to use a computer program to communicate it was exhilarating but frustrating at times sometimes i would say things to myself simply because i could and i believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes others would listen too but as i began to communicate more i realized that it was in fact only just the beginning of creating a new voice for myself i was thrust into a world i didn 't quite know how to function in i stopped going to the care home and managed to get my first job making photocopies i was like a it was disregarded and they did what they felt was best it is about getting the message heard and respected i longed to share my life with thinking i have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to not only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me after all i had been through like looking around and asking who me a man worthy of love i began to reshape my destiny i used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions of those around me and those i had of myself communication is what makes us human enabling us to connect on the deepest level with those around us needs and desires or hearing those of others by really listening all this is how the world knows who we are so who are we without it true communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world once i was perceived to be an inanimate object it is my ability to communicate that has given me all this but i wonder do they pulled from it by caring souls thank you"
