  "transcript": "and because the idea can be explained in one minute i will tell you three stories before to fill in as you well know in ' thirty five and you 'd think he was chasing finches but he wasn 't he was actually collecting fish and he described one of them as very common this was the sailfin grouper we have heard it lots of times on galapagos and other places so there is nothing particular about it we still think it is pristine the brochures still say it is untouched so also to illustrate another concept is called shifting waistline because i was there in ' seventy one studying a lagoon in west africa i was there because and i was convinced and the the lagoon was surrounded by and the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of and they had a good time and they earned more than average in when i went there twenty seven years later they were still kind of happy and the fish also were happy to be there so nothing has changed but everything has changed my third little story is that i was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia in the ' 70s well beginning in the ' 60s europe did lots of development projects fish development meant imposing on countries that had already one hundred thousand fishers to impose and i went sailing on it and we did surveys throughout we didn 't have words for it what we caught i know now is the bottom of the sea and ninety percent of our catch were sponges animals that are fixed on the bottom and actually most of the fish they are a little spot on the debris the piles of debris were coral reef fish and these pictures are extraordinary because within you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins the bottom is transformed from in this case a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess this is a dead turtle they were not eaten they were thrown away because they were dead and one time we caught a live one it was not drowned yet and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that 's never been fished but it 's not documented but we don 't remember it we adjust our baseline if you generalize this something like this happens you have on the y axis and over time it changes it changes because people do things or naturally every generation will use the the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward but they don 't perceive what happened before as a loss you can have a succession of changes at the end you want to sustain we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies they killed animals and they didn 't know they had done so after a few generations because becomes rare so you don 't lose abundant animals you always lose rare animals over time we concentrate on large animals and in a sea that means the big fish they become rarer because we fish them over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline and the question is why do people accept this well because they don 't know and they will contest this because the evidence presented is not in the way they would like the evidence presented for example the anecdote that some present as captain so and so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not because it 's not so you have a situation where people don 't know the past even though we live in literate societies because they don 't trust and hence the enormous role that a marine protected area can play because with marine protected areas we actually recreate we recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides how about the people who can 't do that because they have no access the people in the midwest for example there i think that the arts and film can and simulation this is a simulation of chesapeake bay there were gray whales in chesapeake bay a long time ago five hundred years ago and you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like why people were so touched by it never mind the pocahontas story why so touched by the imagery because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost and so my recommendation it 's the only one i will provide is for cameron to do"
