  "transcript": "but as in computing has changed everything the telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks i want that to sink in for a second our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first first and foremost so what that means is that when you 're talking to your spouse your children a colleague or your doctor on the telephone someone could be listening now that someone might be your own government it could also be another government a foreign intelligence service or a hacker or a criminal or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system that hacks the surveillance system of the telephone companies silicon valley companies have not for example many of you might have an iphone and if you use an iphone to send a text message to other people who have an iphone those likewise if you use facetime to make an audio call and it 's not just apple whatsapp which is now owned by facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world also has built strong often authoritarian wiretapping their text messages anywhere you might imagine that government officials are not very happy and in fact that 's what 's happening government officials are extremely mad and they 're not mad because these encryption tools are now available what upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features and so government officials like british prime minister david cameron they believe and there really are bad people out there there are terrorists and other serious national security threats that i suspect we all want the fbi and the but those surveillance features come at a cost the reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop or a drug dealer 's cell phone we all use the same communications devices what that means is that if then should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly so the the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that i 've described this is not imaginary in two thousand and nine the surveillance systems that google and microsoft built into their networks the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police those systems were compromised by the chinese government because the chinese and that feature the surveillance feature was used to wiretap the greek prime minister and members of the greek cabinet the foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught when you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology you have no way of controlling who 's going to go through it you have no way of controlling whether it 'll be used by your side or the other side by good and i don 't want to live in that kind of world and so right now you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets and so my message to you is this we need to secure our telephone calls we need to secure our text messages but use them because they 're secure"
