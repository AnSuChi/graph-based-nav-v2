  "transcript": "my father was a government worker but she would say to me a king is worshipped only in his own kingdom a poet is respected everywhere so i wanted to be a poet when i grew up but i almost didn 't go to college until an aunt offered financial help i went to study in sambalpur the largest i had dreams of going to the united states for higher studies i crossed two oceans with borrowed money for airfare and only a $ twenty bill in my pocket in the u s i worked in a research center part time while taking graduate classes in economics and i would finance myself and then i would send money home to my brother and my father my story is not unique there are millions of people who migrate each year they risk their lives to realize a dream and that dream is as simple as having a decent job somewhere so they can send money home which has helped them before these are people who live in a country other than their country of birth some one hundred and eighty million of them from poor countries here is a fact that might surprise you hundred and thirteen billion dollars that 's a remarkable number because that is three times the size of the total of development aid money and yet you and i my colleagues in washington by millions of people these sums of money add up to rivers of foreign currency last year received seventy two billion dollars larger than its it exports in egypt remittances are three times the size of revenues from the suez canal and in poorer countries smaller no wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people unlike private investment money they don 't flow back at the first sign of trouble in the country they actually act like an insurance migrants send more money then unlike development aid money that must go through official agencies through governments remittances and often with business by two thousand and five a decade later the share of poor people went down that decline in poverty another poor country the school dropout rate among children the birth weight of children is higher among families that receive remittances remittances are dollars wrapped with care migrants send even more money home for special occasions like a surgery and migrants much as these flows do all that good foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home money transfer companies structure their fees to milk the poor they will say up to five hundred dollars if you want to send we will charge you thirty dollars fixed if you are poor and if you have only two hundred dollars to send you have to pay that that means you send one hundred dollars the family on the other side receives only ninety two dollars twelve percent and then there is the case of venezuela where because of exchange controls you send one hundred dollars and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives even ten dollars nobody sends money to venezuela through the official channel many developing countries actually have a blanket ban on sending money out of the country many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money to specific there are m pesa in kenya enables people to send money and receive money at a fixed cost of only sixty cents per transaction u s fed started a program with mexico to enable money service businesses to send money to mexico for a fixed cost of only these faster cheaper better options can 't be applied internationally because of the fear of money laundering even though there is little data to support any connection any significant connection between money laundering and these small many international banks now are wary of hosting bank accounts of money service businesses especially those serving somalia somalia a country where the per capita income is only two hundred and fifty dollars per year while the left hand is cutting the through regulations then there is the case of poor people from villages the only place where you can get money is through the post office most of the governments in the world have allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies so i cannot go to a cheaper first second open up the partnership so that in the telecommunications industry you have seen what has happened there third large nonprofit they should create a nonprofit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies the development community should set a goal of reducing remittance costs to one percent that is larger than or almost the total aid budget of the united states government the largest donor on the planet another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment fees that migrants pay migrant workers pay to humid workers were coming back from their grueling day of work and i struck a conversation with a he has been sending money home for a few months now i could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance the remittance arrives she takes the money and hands it over to the recruitment agent the children are looking on this has to stop it is not only construction workers from bangladesh it is all the workers there are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem pays about four thousand dollars in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only two thousand dollars per year in he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees the family doesn 't get to see any of it it is not only bangladeshi construction workers it is workers from all over the world it is not only men women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices one of the most exciting and newest thing happening in the area of remittances is how to mobilize through innovation diaspora saving and diaspora giving but they also save a large amount of money where they live migrant savings are estimated to be most of that money is parked in and then say that the money would be used for building train systems in the country of origin a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money because it 's not only financial gains that give them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country 's development remittance channels can be used to sell these bonds to to migrants because when they come on a monthly basis to send remittances that 's when you can actually sell it to them i would love to invest in a bullet train system in india and i would love to contribute to efforts to fight malaria in my village remittances are a great way of sharing prosperity between places in a targeted way that benefits those who need them most remittances empower people we must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper and it can be done to be a poet"
