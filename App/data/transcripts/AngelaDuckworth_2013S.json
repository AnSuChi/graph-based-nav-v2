  "transcript": "years old i left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching i made i calculated grades some of my smartest kids and that got me thinking the but these concepts are not impossible and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and from a psychological perspective in education the one thing we know how to measure best is iq but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings and in every study my question was who is successful here and why my research team and i went to west point military academy we tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year and of those who will be the most effective at improving and who 's going to earn the most money in all those very different contexts one characteristic emerged and it wasn 't social intelligence it wasn 't it was grit grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals grit is having stamina but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality grit is living life like it 's a marathon not a sprint turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate even how safe kids felt when they were at school so it 's not just at west point or the national spelling bee that grit matters it 's also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out to me the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know how little science knows about building it every day parents and teachers ask me how do i build grit in kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic how do i keep them motivated for the long run the honest answer is i don 't know laughter what i do know is that talent doesn 't make you gritty our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated so far the best idea i 've heard about building grit in kids and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort dr dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge because they don 't believe that failure is a permanent condition so growth mindset but we need more and that 's where i 'm going to end my remarks because that 's where we are that 's the work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them we need to measure whether we 've been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons thank you"
