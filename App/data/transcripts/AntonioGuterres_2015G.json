  "transcript": "almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in europe from many different countries of course from syria and iraq afghanistan and bangladesh and eritrea and elsewhere and there have been reactions of two different kinds welcoming parties and long term perspective and the first question is why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months ag well i think basically what triggered this huge increase was the syrian refugee group there has been an increased why i think there are three reasons two long term ones and the trigger the long term ones in relation to syrians is that hope is less because there is no political solution so there is no we just had research with the world bank and eighty seven percent of the syrians in jordan and ninety three percent of the syrians in lebanon live below the national poverty lines which means that people are living very badly not only are they refugees out of home not only have they suffered what they have suffered but they are living in and then the trigger was when all of a sudden international aid decreased they 're not allowed to work and people started if i had been in the same situation wasn 't supposed to be sudden the war in syria has been happening for five years millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around syria and yet europe looked totally unprepared ag you prefer to postpone decisions because you do not have the capacity to and the proof is that even when the spike occurred europe remained divided and was unable to put in place a mechanism to manage the situation but the population of the european union is five hundred and fifty million people which means we are talking about one per the question is is this something that could have been managed if but forgetting about root causes for now looking at the phenomenon as it is able to come together in solidarity to create and then screening the people too little too late bg it 's already breaking down ag my country is supposed to receive four thousand four thousand in portugal means nothing so and austria they are the three countries that are in the end receiving the refugees the rest of europe is looking without doing much bg let me make them blunt but i think the questions are very present in the minds of many people in europe right now the first of course is about numbers you say five hundred and fifty million versus one million is not much but realistically how many people can europe take because so there is no way you can say i take ten thousand and that 's finished in turkey at the beginning of the crisis i remember one minister saying turkey will be able to receive up to one thousand or something of the sort if you count all refugees so i don 't think it 's fair to say how many we can take what it is fair to say is how we can we organize ourselves to assume our international responsibilities and but as the public less and less believes in european institutions it is also each time more difficult to convince the public that we need more europe to solve these problems bg we seem to be at the point where the numbers turn into political shifts particularly domestically we saw it again this weekend in france but we have seen it over and over in many countries in poland and in denmark and in switzerland and elsewhere the the mood changes radically because of of the numbers although they are not very significant in absolute what does a european see at home in a opening the news every single day a crowd coming uncontrolled moving from border to border and the images on television were of hundreds or thousands of people moving and the idea is that nobody is taking care of it this is happening without any kind of management and so their idea and everything will welcomed and the moved by plane to different european countries this would not have scared people we have a lot of people scared just because europe was not able to do the job properly bg but there are villages in germany with so what 's your position how do you imagine these people reacting ag if there would be a proper management of the situation and the proper distribution of people all over europe you would always have the percentage that i mentioned one per impossible to live with and of course if you have a village in lebanon there are many villages that have more syrians than lebanese lebanon has been living with that i 'm not asking for the same to happen in europe for all european villages to have more refugees than and to be able to organize itself to receive people as other countries in the world were forced to do in the past bg so if you look at the global situation not only at europe bg yes bg if you look at the global situation so not only at europe i know you can make a long list of countries that are not really stepping up but i 'm more interested in the other part is there somebody who 's doing well eighty six percent of the refugees in the world are in the developing world and if you look at countries like ethiopia ethiopia has received more than six hundred thousand refugees all the borders in ethiopia are open and they have as a policy they have sudanese they have somalis african countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming and i would say that in the middle east now we see some problems with the syrian situation as the syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis but the truth is that for a large period all borders in the middle east were open so i would say that even today the trend in the developing world the trend in the developed world is a mixture of discussions between refugee protections on one side and security questions in my opinion misinterpreted on the other side bg we 'll come back to that too but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers from the world food programme that reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these these issues now that the world seems to have woken up are you getting more funding and more support or it 's still the same ag we are getting more support i would say that we are coming close to the levels of last year we were much worse but that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people and here we have the priorities of development cooperation that is required for instance lebanon and jordan are middle income countries because they are middle income countries they cannot receive they are pillars of stability in the region with all the difficulties they face and the first line of defense of our collective security and they are not but the local communities themselves are suffering because salaries went down because there are more unemployed because prices if you look at today 's situation of the indicators in these countries it is clear that their poor groups of the population are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing bg who should be providing this support country by country international organizations the european union who should be coming up with this support to join all efforts it 's clear that it 's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential it 's clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility in order to be able to invest we need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today in protracted situations at a certain moment that it doesn 't make sense anymore to make a distinction between humanitarian aid you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded you are talking about things that require a long term perspective a development perspective and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective bg i would like your comment on something that was in newspapers this morning yesterday he said this no listen to this it 's interesting i quote until our country 's representatives can figure out what 's going on how do you react to that ag well it 's not only donald trump several people around the world with political responsibility saying for instance that muslims refugees should not i am very keen on the need for governments to protect the security but if you say like that in the us or in any european country we are going to close our doors to muslim refugees what you are saying is the best possible help for the propaganda of terrorist organizations because what you are saying what you are saying will be heard by all the muslims in your own country and it will pave the way for the and the mechanisms that through technology and it 's just telling them you are right we are against you so this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic multi religious multicultural this is creating a situation in which really is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed bg have the recent attacks in paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult reaction in relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is close all borders not understanding so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing syrians i am convinced it was on purpose because part of the strategies of daesh is against refugees because they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate and are fleeing to the crusaders and i think that is part of daesh 's strategy to make europe react closing its doors to muslim refugees and having an hostility towards muslims inside europe exactly to facilitate daesh 's work and my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement that triggered terrorism i think as i said essentially terrorism in europe is today a homegrown movement in relation to the global situation that we are facing and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong by welcoming what we are today paying for in europe is the failures of integration models that didn 't work in the ' 60s in the ' 70s in the ' 80s in relation to big migration flows that took place at that time and generated what is today in many of the people for instance of the second generation of communities having improper education living in some of the neighborhoods that are not adequately provided by public infrastructure and this kind of sometimes even anger that exists in this second generation is largely due to the failure of integration policies the failure of what should have been a much stronger investment in creating the conditions for people to live together and respect each other for me it is clear failed in that investment in the past few decades bg question you are stepping down from your job at after ten years if you look back at two thousand and five when you entered that office for the first time what do you see in two thousand and five we were helping one million people go back home we helped one hundred and twenty four thousand in two thousand and five we had about million people displaced by conflict in the world today we have more than sixty million it is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was it is clear that the capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them is unfortunately much worse than what it was ten years ago there are no clear power relations in the world which means that namely those a tradition in american politics that when a president leaves the oval office for the last time if you had to write such a note to your successor filippo grandi what would you write ag well i don 't think i would write any message you know one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver if i had to say something to him"
