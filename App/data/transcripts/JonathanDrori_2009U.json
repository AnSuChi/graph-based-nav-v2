  "transcript": "let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds just think for a moment it doesn 't matter whether you live in a small everything comes back to plants in the end and without them we wouldn 't be here and they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us or because of the introduction of alien plants into places that they really oughtn 't be or move and i want to tell you about a project to and the way that you save plants is by storing seeds because seeds in all their diverse glory are plants ' futures all the genetic information for future generations of plants it looks it exists not only in southern england but distributed around the world god forbid that it should have to withstand that and those are the dry land species so first of all we did deals with fifty different countries it means negotiating with heads of state and with secretaries of state in fifty countries to sign treaties we have one hundred and twenty partner institutions all over the world in all those countries colored orange and then they go away and plan exactly how they 're going to collect these seeds they have thousands of people all over the world tagging and they go back when their and they collect the seeds all over the world the seeds some of if is very untechnical you kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off you label them you do some high tech things here and there some low tech things here and there and the main thing is that you have to dry them and then you have to store them them at about minus twenty degrees c that 's about minus four fahrenheit i think with a very critically low moisture content and these seeds will be able to germinate we believe with many of the species in thousands of years and certainly in hundreds of years it 's no good storing the seeds if you don 't know they 're still viable so every ten years we do germination tests on every sample of seeds that we have and that is very but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants and that 's already happening so where have we got to i am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed that 's three thousand millionth seed ten percent of all plant species on the planet twenty four thousand species are safe thirty thousand species if we get the funding by next year by two thousand and twenty these are not not just crop plants as you might have seen stored in svalbard in norway fantastic work there this is at least one hundred times bigger we have thousands of collections that have been sent out all over the world drought tolerant forest species sent to pakistan and egypt especially plants come here to the united states salt tolerant pasture species sent to australia the list goes on and on these seeds are used for restoration so in habitats that have already been damaged or in mined land in various countries restoration is already happening because of these species and because of this collection some of these plants like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen they are down to the last few remaining members the one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck useful plant both for protein and for medicine"
