  "transcript": "shots might start to look familiar this is central park one of the most beautifully designed public spaces in america but to anyone who hasn 't visited these images can 't really fully convey to really understand central park you have to physically be there well the same is true of the music which my brother and i composed and mapped specifically for central park i 'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing that 's us there that 's both of us actually specifically about a concept that we 've been developing over the last few years this idea of but recently we 've become more and more interested in projects where art and technology intersect from creating sight specific audio and video installation but today i want to focus on this concept of composition for physical space brightly colored sculptures decorated the park for a number of weeks and unlike work that 's exhibited in a more neutral space like on the walls of a gallery or a museum this was work that was really in dialogue with this place and in a lot of ways the gates was really a celebration of frederick olmsted 's incredible design my brother and i moved back to washington d c and we started to ask the question would it be possible in the same way that the gates responded to the physical layout of the park which brought us to this we released the national mall album released exclusively as a mobile app that uses the device 's gps functionality to sonically map the entire park in our hometown of washington hundreds of musical segments are geo tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape a musical score is actually unfolding around them so this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park so think of this as a let 's take a closer look let 's look at one example here so using the app as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the washington monument you hear the sounds of instruments warming up which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody this is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins fireworks and all sorts of musical craziness as if all of these sounds are radiating out from this giant obelisk that punctuates the center of the park but were you to walk in the opposite direction this entire sequence happens in reverse and unlike a normal album we haven 't been able to accommodate this request when they ask for a c d or an mp3 version we just can 't make that happen and the reason is is because this isn 't a promotional app or a game to promote or accompany the release of a traditional record in this case the app is the work itself and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience six months later we did a location aware album for central park a park that is over two times the size of the national mall with music spanning from the sheep 's but last spring we started a project here actually at stanford 's experimental media art department location aware album to date one that will span the entirety of highway one here on the but it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that 's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with thank you"
