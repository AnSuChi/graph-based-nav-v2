  "transcript": "why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of though it was based on very were made in the same way with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain then the owners of these two brains should have similar and the other is a cow now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it i think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more and here comes the bad news our brain largest one around it which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive so that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body that 's because the size of the brain usually follows gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are so their brains should also be larger than ours but instead it 's the other way around our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain although it weighs only two percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day that 's five hundred calories out of a total of two thousand calories so and this is where the story started to bother me in biology we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest sized brain so this to me became the important question to answer how many neurons does the human brain have and how does that compare to other animals so ten years ago i asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from but nobody did i 've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number or parts of that brain and you dissolve it in detergent which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact so you end up with suspension of free nuclei that looks like this like a clear soup this soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution you can count nuclei and therefore take rodents and primates for instance in larger rodent brains the average size of the neuron increases so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons but primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain the result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size and the larger the brain the larger this difference will be well sixteen billion of which are in the cerebral cortex and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like and that sixteen billion is the most neurons that any cortex has but just as important is what billion neurons mean because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain so a rodent brain with eighty six billion neurons would weigh thirty six kilos and this impossible brain would go in the body of so the correct comparison is to other which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion i am a primate and all of you are but it is not special in its number of neurons it is just a large primate brain i think that 's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature why does and it turns out that both human so the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple linear function and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect so the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal but just because we 're primates not because we 're special last question then how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons and in particular if great apes are larger than when we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain i figured we calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods and on the other hand how much energy a body of a size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day and what we found is that because neurons are so expensive there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons so a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most then its body cannot be any bigger than twenty five kilos to weigh any more than that it has to give up neurons so it 's either a large body or a large number of neurons when you eat like a primate you can 't afford both one way out of this metabolic limitation would be to gorillas and orangutans for instance afford about thirty billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating and that seems to be about as much as they can do nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate what about us with our eighty six billion neurons and sixty to seventy kilos of body mass we should have to spend over nine hours per day every we should not be here how did we get here then well if our brain costs just as much energy as it should and if we can 't spend every waking hour of the day then the only alternative is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods and remarkably that matches exactly what when they invented cooking to cook is to use fire to so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons could now become a major asset so i think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution all of the while remaining just a primate brain we went rapidly from raw foods to so what once was a solution we look for the solution so what is the human advantage what is it that we have that no other animal has my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex and i think that 's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities and what is it that we do that no other animal does and which i believe was fundamental to allow us to largest number of neurons in the cortex in two words we cook and i think that 's how we got to become human"
