  "transcript": "only got eighteen minutes to explain something that lasts for hours and days so i 'd better get started let 's start with a clip from al jazeera 's listening post and that 's the norwegian media in a nutshell not much drama a few years back norway 's public tv channel nrk decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven hour train ride seven hours of simple footage a train rolling down the tracks norwegians more than a million of them according to the ratings and it 's called slow tv executives at norway 's national broadcasting service are now considering broadcasting a night of knitting so we sent the listening post 's marcela pizarro to oslo to find out what it is but first a warning viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing when one of my colleagues got a great idea where do you get your ideas in the lunchroom why don 't we make a radio program wow brilliant idea so we sat in our lunchroom and discussed so one of us came up with a train the bergen railway had its 100 year anniversary that over seven hours and the answer was yes but how long will the program be so one bright day in september we started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes actually it turned out to be seven hours and fourteen minutes due to a signal failure three of them pointing and that 's about it but of course also the one hundred and sixty tunnels gave us it will fit for the two thousand train spotters in norway we but no this was far more attractive this is the five biggest tv channels in norway on a normal friday and if you look at happened when they put on the bergen railway show one point two million norwegians watched part of this program and another funny thing when the host on our main channel after they have got news for you she said and on our second the train has now nearly reached myrdal station thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this it was so nice to see all the thousands of facebook and twitter users talking to each other as if they were on the same train together and his head hit the curtain rod and he realized he is the first twitter message came why be a chicken why minute by minute and do the iconic journey in norway the coastal ship journey hurtigruten from bergen to kirkenes almost three thousand we watched this picture it 's all l station what if more people knew that we were on board that train would more people show up what this is back in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four when the technical managers have suits and ties and nrk rolled all its equipment on board a ship transmitting the signal back and in the machine room they talked to the machine guy and on the deck they have splendid entertainment so being on a ship it 's not the first time and we asked our viewers out there what do how do you want this to do you want us to make a website what do you want on it so in june two thousand and eleven twenty three of us went on board the hurtigruten coastal ship and we to be he 's head of research at the university in troms it belongs to a guy called erik hansen it 's people like those two they made all the stories it says i will be a little late for school tomorrow he was supposed to be in the school at eight a m he came at nine and he didn 't get a note from his teacher because the teacher had watched the program yes we took a conference room on board the hurtigruten this is one of and when you give this sketch to professional people in the norwegian broadcasting company nrk you get some cool stuff back and with some very creative solutions it made it possible for us to take and asked how is this man doing he 's doing fine everything went well we also could take pictures of people thousands of them and when you take a picture of them and they get the message now we are on tv dad they start waving back this was waving tv for five and a half days and people get so extremely happy when they can send it was also a great success on social media and we also on the web during this week we streamed more than one hundred years of and the websites are still there and they will be forever actually because hurtigruten was selected to be part of the norwegian unesco list of and it 's also in the guinness book of records as the longest documentary so some watched part of it like the prime minister some watched a little bit more it says i haven 't used my bed for five days and though it probably won 't you can see the famous and a day after all time high for it 's a pleasure to put hurtigruten on top of it it looks like this even the passengers on board the hurtigruten coastal ship nature people and we started looking for other things we could make slow about so we could either take it 's fourteen hours of birdwatching it actually took three hours before we got the first fish and that we have made twelve hours of boat ride into the beautiful telemark canal and we have made another train ride with the northern railway we did it in four seasons just to give the viewer another experience on the way so our next i 've got my eye on a wildly popular program from norway called national firewood night which and then eight hours of a fire burning in a fireplace it destroyed the other top norwegian shows like so you think you can watch paint dry almost twenty percent of the norwegian population tuned in twenty percent th we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater and the people on the show are falling asleep and after all that nothing counts and death is coming for us all we take the and the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there actually being on the train on the boat and knitting together with others and the reason i think why they 're doing that is because we don 't edit and it 's also important that what we make slow tv about is something that we all can relate to that the viewer can relate to and that somehow has a root in our culture this is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks but more important is what you don 't plan you don 't plan what 's going to happen it 's a nice picture but now you can and when you keep it that long i 'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow and we kept it for ten minutes so we think that slow tv is one nice way of telling a tv story and we think that once or twice a year so we keep the feeling of an event and we also think that the good slow tv idea that 's the idea when people say oh no you can 't put that on tv so after all life is best when it 's a bit strange thank you"
