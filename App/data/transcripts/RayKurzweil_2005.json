  "transcript": "to be here we 've heard a lot about the promise i 've been quite interested in both if we could convert zero point zero three percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy we could meet all of our projected needs for we can 't do that today because solar panels are heavy expensive and very inefficient there are nano engineered designs which at least have been analyzed theoretically that show the potential to be very lightweight very inexpensive very that 's a key trend is decentralization moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption bono spoke very eloquently that we have the tools for the first time to address of disease and poverty most regions of the world are moving in that direction in one thousand nine hundred and ninety in east asia and the pacific region there were five hundred million people living in poverty that number now is under two hundred million the world bank projects by two thousand and eleven it will be under twenty million which is a reduction of ninety five percent but we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty and i 'm going to talk about those issues if we have the will kevin kelly talked about the acceleration of technology that 's been a strong interest of mine and a theme that i 've developed for some thirty years i realized that my technologies had to make sense that invariably the world was a different place when i would introduce a technology and i noticed that most inventions fail not because the r & d department can 't get it to work they will actually succeed if given opportunity to build what they say they 're going to build and ninety percent of those projects or more will fail because the timing is wrong not all the enabling factors will be in place when they 're needed so i began to be an ardent student of technology trends and track where technology would be at different points in time and began to build build the mathematical models of that it 's kind of taken life of its own i 've got a group of ten people that work with me to gather data and if you ask me will the price of google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now that 's very hard to say will wimax but if you ask me what will it cost for one mips of computing in two thousand and ten or the cost to sequence a base pair of dna in two thousand and twelve or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in two thousand and fourteen it turns out that bandwidth and i 'm going to show you a small sample of this but there 's really a theoretical reason why technology and a lot of people when they think about the future think about it linearly they think they 're going to continue to develop a problem or address a problem using today 's tools at today 's pace of progress and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth we had our best ph d students our most advanced equipment around the world we got one 10 000th of the project done so how 're we going to get this done in fifteen years and ten years and you 've managed to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome but it 's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve it explodes most of the project was done in the last it took us fifteen years to sequence we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems i 'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is the actual the rate of adopting new ideas is doubling every decade according to our models these are all logarithmic graphs so as you go up the levels it represents generally multiplying by factor of ten or one hundred it took us half a if you put different now this is an interesting chart and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes the evolution of dna actually it was rna came first took billions of years but then evolution used that backbone to bring on the next stage so the cambrian explosion when all the body plans of the animals were evolved took only ten million years it was two hundred times faster and then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions and biological evolution kept accelerating it 's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process so homo sapiens the first technology creating species the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage and by the way chimpanzees don 't really have a very good opposable thumb so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination and and then working through interaction evolution used essentially the technology creating species to bring on the next stage which were the first steps in technological evolution and the first step took tens of thousands of years stone tools fire the wheel kept accelerating we always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation and we 've had a continual acceleration but some observer says well kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall took fifteen different lists from key thinkers like the encyclopedia britannica the museum of natural history carl sagan 's cosmic calendar on the same and these people were not trying to make my point these were just lists in reference works and i think that 's what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution and again it forms the same straight line you have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements what the key points are there 's differences of opinion when agriculture started or how long the cambrian explosion took but you see a very clear trend there 's a basic profound acceleration of this evolutionary process information technologies double their capacity price performance bandwidth and that 's a very profound explosion of exponential growth a personal experience when i was at mit computer taking up about the size of this room less powerful than the which is very often identified with this exponential growth is just one example of many because it 's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology i put forty nine famous computers on this logarithmic graph by the way a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth it took us three years to double our price performance of computing in one thousand nine hundred two years in the middle we 're now doubling it every one year and that 's exponential growth through five different paradigms moore 's law was just the last part of that where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit but we had electro mechanical calculators relay based computers that cracked the german enigma code vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of eisenhower discreet transistors used in the first space flights and then moore 's law every time one paradigm ran out of steam another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth they were shrinking vacuum tubes making them smaller and smaller that hit a wall they couldn 't shrink them and keep the vacuum whole different paradigm transistors came out of the woodwork in fact when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm and because we 've been predicting the end of moore 's law the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width and we won 't be able to shrink them any more that 'll be the end of moore 's law but it won 't be the end of the exponential growth of computing because chips are flat we live in a three dimensional world we might as well use the third dimension we will go into the molecular circuits to work we 'll have those ready supercomputers same thing processor performance on intel chips you could buy ten million in two thousand and two it 's pretty remarkable how smooth i mean you 'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior countries accusing each other of dumping products ipos bankruptcies marketing programs you would think it would be a very erratic process and you have a very outcome of this chaotic process just as we can 't predict what one molecule in a gas will do it 's hopeless to predict a single molecule yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas using thermodynamics but the result of this whole worldwide chaotic unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable and we can predict these trends far into unlike gertrude stein 's roses it 's not the case that a transistor is a transistor so you 've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors so the cost you add other forms of innovation and processor design and that 's basically deflation it 's true of the world wide web i mean anything that we can quantify we have hundreds of different measurements of different double every twelve thirteen fifteen months depending on what you 're looking at in terms of price performance that 's a forty to fifty percent deflation rate and economists have actually started worrying about that we had deflation during the depression but that was collapse of the money supply collapse of consumer confidence a completely different phenomena this is due to greater productivity but the economist says but there 's no way you 're going to be able to keep up with that if you have fifty percent deflation people may increase their volume thirty forty percent but they won 't keep up with it but what we 're actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it we 've had twenty eight percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last fifty years i mean people didn 't build as the price performance makes new applications feasible magnetic data storage that 's not moore 's law it 's shrinking magnetic spots different engineers different companies same exponential process a key revolution is that we 're understanding our own biology in these information terms we 're understanding the software programs that these were evolved in very different like to actually change those programs one little software program called the fat insulin receptor gene basically says hold onto every calorie because the next hunting season may not work out so well that was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago we 'd like to actually turn that program off they tried that in animals they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this felt that would be and that 's just one of the thirty thousand we were evolved in an era where it wasn 't in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference like to live much longer because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them so life long lifespans like that is to say much more than thirty but we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution there are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place there 's actually a for the first time now something going to human trials that actually cures pulmonary hypertension a fatal disease and this technology is also accelerating it cost ten dollars per base pair in one thousand nine hundred and ninety a penny in two thousand it 's now under a 10th of a cent the amount of genetic data basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year enabling the genome project to be completed another major revolution the communications revolution the price performance bandwidth capacity of of communications measured many different ways wired wireless is is growing exponentially the internet has been doubling in power and continues to measured many different ways this is based on the number miniaturization we 're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate both wired and wireless these are some designs from eric drexler 's book which we 're now showing are feasible with super computing simulations where actually there are scientists building molecule scale robots one has one that actually walks that 's built out of the most exciting opportunity is actually to go inside the human body these things have already been done in animals there 's one nano engineered device that cures type one diabetes it 's blood cell sized they put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell they tried this in rats it lets insulin out in a controlled what you 're watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub optimal even though it 's remarkable in its intricacy reverse engineering biology is accelerating we can actually design these things to be you could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours so honey i 'm in the pool will take on a whole new meaning it will be interesting to see what we do in our olympic trials have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out performing the freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell these are scenarios but they 're not as futuristic as it may sound there are four major conferences on building blood cell sized devices there are many experiments in animals there 's actually one going this is feasible technology if we come back to our exponential growth of computing one thousand dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain it will intersect human intelligence in terms of capacity in the 2020s but that 'll be the hardware side of the equation where will we get the software well it turns out we can see inside the human brain and in fact not surprisingly the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year and with the new generation of scanning tools the first time we can actually see individual inter neural fibers and see them processing and signaling in real time but then the question is ok we can get this data now but can we understand it doug hofstadter wonders well maybe our intelligence just isn 't great enough to understand our intelligence and if we were smarter well then our brains would be that much more complicated and we 'd never catch up to it it turns out that we can understand it this is a block diagram of of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually works quite well in applying psychoacoustic tests gets very similar results to human auditory perception there 's another simulation of the cerebellum that 's more than half the neurons in the brain again works very similarly to human skill formation this is at an early stage but you can show with the reverse engineering the human brain by the 2020s we 've already had very good models and simulation of about fifteen regions out of the several hundred all of this is we 've had productivity go from thirty dollars to one hundred and fifty dollars per hour wall street noticed they figured well that was wrong and then we had this bust technology that we put together using some of the technologies we 're involved in providing full immersion virtual reality augmented real reality we 'll be interacting with virtual personalities but if we go to two thousand and twenty nine we really have the full maturity of these trends and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations greater price performance capacity and bandwidth of these technologies which is pretty phenomenal it 'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today we 'll have completed the reverse engineering of the human brain one thousand dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic computers will combine the subtle powers of human intelligence but it 's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines these nano bots i mentioned will first be used for cleaning up the environment providing powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized but they 'll also go inside our brain interact with our biological neurons we 've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this so for example full immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system the nano bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment and then it 'll feel like you 're in that virtual environment you can go there with other people have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses experience beamers i call them will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the internet it 'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology which in some sense we 're doing already we routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology human life expectancy is expanding it was thirty seven in one thousand eight hundred and with this sort of biotechnology nano technology revolutions this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead my main message is that progress in technology is exponential not linear many even if you really look at the power of exponential growth you 'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand and information technology is increasingly encompassing all of our lives from our music to our manufacturing to our biology to our energy to materials we 'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s from information in very inexpensive raw materials using nano technology these are very powerful technologies they both empower our promise and our peril so we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems thank you very much"
