  "transcript": "he took it out for the first public test drive and true story we 've been working around that least reliable part of the car the driver the driver now today i 'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully and what they can do for the world and it 's a big problem one point two million people are killed on the world 's roads every year in america alone thirty three thousand people are killed each year that 's the same as a seven cars are sold to us like this but really this is what driving 's like it 's rainy and you want to do anything other than drive and the reason why is this traffic is getting worse in america between one thousand nine hundred and ninety and two thousand and ten the vehicle miles traveled so if you take the average commute time in america which is about fifty minutes you multiply that by the one hundred and twenty million workers we have that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day that turns out to be one hundred and sixty two lifetimes spent and then there are those of us who don 't have the privilege of sitting in traffic so this is steve he 's an incredibly it 's a two hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit or asking friends and family for a ride he doesn 't have that same freedom that you and i have to get around we should do something about that now conventional wisdom would say that we 'll just take these driver assistance systems and we 'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them and over time they 'll turn into well i 'm here to tell you that 's like me saying that if i work really hard at jumping one day i 'll be able to fly we actually need to do something a little different and so i 'm going to talk to you about three different ways that self driving systems are different than driver assistance systems we had the first test of a self driving car where we let regular people use it we put them in the car we let them use it as someone trying to bring a product into the world every one of them told us they loved it in fact we had a porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day this is completely stupid what are we thinking but at the end of it he said not only should i have it everyone else should have it because people are terrible drivers but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing this was eye opening now my favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phone and realizes so he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack pulls out the charging cable for puts it into the laptop puts it on the phone sure enough the phone is charging all the time he 's been doing sixty five miles per hour down the freeway so we thought about this and we said it 's kind of obvious right the better the technology gets the less reliable the driver is going to get so by just making the cars incrementally smarter we 're probably not going to see the wins we really need let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here at this graph and along the bottom is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn 't you can ignore most of that axis because if you 're driving around town and the car starts stopping randomly you 're never going to buy that car now if we look at the bottom left but it also doesn 't get you out of an accident but it 's never going to avoid all of the accidents because it doesn 't have that capability right we just but if we want a self driving car we need a technology curve that looks like this we 're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle and we 'll pick some operating point up here where it basically never gets into a crash they 'll happen but very low frequency now you and i could look at this and we could argue about whether it 's incremental and i could say something like so let 's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing and so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system it turns out that human drivers make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents about once every one hundred thousand miles in america in contrast a that 's like comparing how fast i run to the speed of light it doesn 't matter how hard i train i 'm never actually going to get there so there 's a pretty big gap there but in the case of a driver assistance system that means it can 't take action because again if it presses the brakes unexpectedly that 's completely and then react appropriately after that so it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be so that 's enough about the differences between the two let 's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world so this is our vehicle it starts by understanding where it is in the world by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning so here all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist and up in the distance if you look really closely you can see some cones then we know where the car is in the moment but we have to do better than that we have to predict what 's going to happen so here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed so it needs to needs to get out of the way knowing that one pickup truck is great pressing the brake or gas so how hard can it really be back when we started in two thousand and nine this is what our system looked like so you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road driving down the highway the car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are it 's really a geometric understanding of the world once we started driving on neighborhood and city streets the problem becomes a whole new level of it has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well and of course if anyone 's breaking the police are there and the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car means that it 's not just a car it 's actually a police officer and when a police officer stood in the road our vehicle should understand that this we should continue now the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles but we actually have a much deeper understanding of this we could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time and vehicles that have been out there and understand what they look like and use that to infer what other vehicles should look like and other pedestrians should look like so here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us here there 's a cyclist coming down the road and we know they 're going to continue here somebody makes a right turn and so just a couple of months ago our vehicles were driving through mountain view and this is what we encountered this is a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road now it turns out there is nowhere in the dmv handbook that tells you how to deal with that but our vehicles were able to encounter that slow down and drive safely now we don 't have to deal with just ducks watch this bird fly across in front of us the car reacts to that here we have to deal with drivers watch the left as the car with the green box decides he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment here as we make a lane change the car to our left decides it wants to as well and here we watch a car blow through a red light and of course we have people who do i don 't know what sometimes on the road like this guy pulling out between two self driving cars you have to ask what are you thinking so what we 're looking at is the scene with the cyclist but the car can it 's that little blue box up there and that comes from the laser data and if you 're really good at looking at laser data you can see a few dots on the curve there right there and that blue box is that cyclist but the cyclist we see is going to proceed through the intersection our light has now turned green his is solidly red and we now anticipate that this bike is going to come all the way across unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention they started to pull forward and fortunately for everyone this cyclists reacts avoids and makes it through the intersection and at this point we 're pretty convinced this technology is going to come to market we do three million miles of testing in our simulators every single day so you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have self driving rather than driver assistance approach because the urgency is in the time i have given this talk today thirty four people have died on america 's roads he 's going to be able to get his i mean there 's a real debate going on out there right now so some of the companies for example driver assisted route what you 're saying is that that that 's kind of going to be a dead end because you can 't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless at some point and then a driver is going to say this feels safe and climb into the back and something ugly will happen cu right that 's exactly right and it 's not to say that the the but to see the transformative opportunity to help someone like steve get around to really get to the the end case in safety to have the opportunity to change our cities and move parking out and get rid of these urban craters we call parking lots it 's the only way to go"
