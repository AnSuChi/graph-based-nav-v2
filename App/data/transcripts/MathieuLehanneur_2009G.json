  "transcript": "wilder penfield saw himself and a tiny bottom actually this creature is the result of the penfield research he named it homunculus basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where homunculus is definitely not a freak it 's you or smokers put instinctively their fingers in the mouth unfortunately it doesn 't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing even if i do not understand science entirely for my design i essentially refer to it i 'm and it really helps me to understand how our brain can inform or mislead us it 's a great tool for me to to understand what could be our real needs marketing reduces things marketing simplifies marketing creates user groups amidst complexity amidst fluctuation and uniqueness what could be our in our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds and prevent us from being quiet and and focused so i wanted to create a kind of sound filter able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution but i didn 't want it to make it by isolating people without any earmuffs or i just wanted to using the complexity and the so i worked with white noise db is basically db is the name of the product basically a white noise diffuser this is white noise the white noise is the sum of all frequencies so when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter and when you hear the white noise your brain is immediately focused and in mine i hope so i create a ball a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive emits white noise in order to neutralize it it works you feel the effect of the white noise if you make some noise you can feel the effect so this object is not a very smart object and i don 't want to make a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend you shout you say blah blah blah blah blah blah who is this guy and db will probably roll toward you and turning around you and this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day and able to give you the quantity of light you need this object is but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object i want by this design better than you and probably before you what you really need you have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some problem of energy or problem of libido so a huge problem i 'm just a designer so i need so there can be some and i submit them my and this kind of indeed in my studies i was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry this project you have to know that roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly target of stability the behavior of the of the patients goes more and more unstable so we took too many of them we took irregular dosage we do not follow instructions and so on this one is an antibiotic and its purpose is to help patient to go and the concept is to create and so and you and and here you can get the white core and i designed it to help kids but in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient so the idea is and breathe the air it contains so by this way the kid to take care of himself is to take care of this living object as the asthma treatment needs him in this guise of living object approach i like the idea of a kind of invisible design as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves a kind of soul of and almost a kind of poltergeist effect so when a passive object like this one seems to be alive because it and i remember an exhibition design i made for john maeda and john maeda was supposed to show and john was so excited by this idea and he told me after a long silence i wonder mathieu if people won 't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos laughter it would be a great if he hadn 't decided to take all them off i guess you won 't be surprised if i tell you that pinocchio is one of my great influences pinocchio is probably one of the other great influence is the mine 's canary in coal mines so this canary was to say to the miners the air is too bad you have to go it 's an emergency so it 's for me andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses from air so it uses some plants to do this job selected for you have to know so while i 'm talking to you you are currently breathing formaldehyde it 's the same for me with the carpet and this is exactly the same at home because all the product we get constantly give away the volatile component of which they 're made of so let 's have a look at your home very toxic this is the reason why i created with david edward a scientist of harvard university an object able to absorb toxic elements using those kind of plants but the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants because the roots of the plant are not very effective bill wolverton from nasa analyzed it cleverly in the ' 70s so the idea is to create an object able to force the air and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place in it will be launched next september this one is but here so the locavores used to get food taken in a radius of one hundred miles local river is able to provide you food so the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem and the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish after it goes back into the amazing channel and you make some sushis with with a fish and the aromatic plants above because you can grow some potatoes no not potatoes but tomatoes aromatic plants and so on so now we can breathe safely now we can now we can be well balanced in our biorhythm with so i tried to in order to work a very stimulative office i wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play and where your body and your brain can work together so in this office like a politician your seat your sleep and your play on a in this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper but like that can make some sport during your work in this office you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature you include the nature in the floor of the of the office you can see it there"
