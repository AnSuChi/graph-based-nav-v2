  "transcript": "two twin domes the other of a single silk the other is designed by her but living things are not chiseled they grow we carry all the information that 's required for every other cell to function and to replicate tools also have consequences at least since the industrial revolution the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts take human skin for example our facial skins are thin with large pores our back skins are thicker with small pores and yet it 's the same skin no parts no assemblies it 's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity the split personality of every designer and architect operating today between the chisel and the gene between henry ford and charles darwin these two worldviews my left brain and right brain analysis and synthesis will play out on the two screens behind me my work at its simplest level is about uniting these two worldviews we live in a very special time in history a rare time a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we 've never had access to before these fields are computational design allowing us to design complex forms with simple code additive manufacturing letting us produce parts by adding material rather than carving it out materials engineering which lets us design the behavior of materials in high resolution and synthetic biology and at the intersection of these four fields my team and i create please meet the minds and hands of my students we design objects and products and structures and tools across like this robotic arm with an 80 foot diameter reach with a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings to nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms that glow in the dark here we 've reimagined the mashrabiya an archetype of ancient arabic architecture and created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized to shape the form of light and heat moving through it we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt this was for a paris fashion show with iris van herpen like a second skin that are made of a single part stiff at the contours flexible around the waist together with my printing collaborator stratasys we 3d printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells and i 'll show more objects like it this helmet combines stiff and soft materials in resolution this is the resolution of a human hair it 's also the resolution of a ct scanner that designers have access to such analytic and synthetic tools enables and by designing this irregular surface pattern it becomes we printed its surface out of forty four different properties corresponding to pressure points on the human body varies its functionality not by adding another material or another assembly but by continuously and delicately varying material property but is nature ideal i wasn 't raised in a religious jewish home but when i was young my grandmother used to tell me stories from the hebrew bible and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what i care about as she recounts on the third day of creation god commands the earth to grow a fruit bearing fruit tree there was to be no differentiation between the land created a world made of parts i often ask myself what would design design be like if objects were made of a single part would we return to a better state of creation and we found it the second most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin and some one hundred million tons of it are produced we called legal seafood we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells we grinded them and we produced varying chemical concentrations we were able to achieve a wide array of properties to light soft and transparent the robot would vary material properties on the fly and create these material one hundred percent recyclable when the parts are ready they 're left to dry and find a form naturally upon contact with air the air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms that first appeared on our planet three point five billion together with our collaborators at harvard and mit we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into sugar we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition from beam and if scaled even larger working with an ancient material one of the first lifeforms on the planet plenty of water we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells into an architecture that behaves the setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system we looked for the possibility of creating to do that we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow we came up with our own table of the elements new lifeforms that were computationally grown additively manufactured and biologically augmented i like to think of synthetic biology as precious metals you 're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels it 's called microfluidics we 3d printed our own channels in order to control the flow of these liquid bacterial cultures it lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds and the second the other consumes that sugar and produces biofuels useful for the built environment now these two microorganisms never interact in nature think of it as evolution but evolution by design we then started growing these channels on the human body varying material properties according to the desired functionality where we wanted more photosynthesis we would design more transparent channels when it 's stretched end to end and here it is for the first time unveiled at ted our first photosynthetic wearable liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing thank you mary shelley said we are unfashioned creatures but only half made up what if design could provide that other half what if we could create structures that would augment living matter what if we could create personal scan our skins repair damaged tissue think of this as a form of edited biology to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery and to move away from the age of the machine to do this we always need to return back to nature by now you know that a 3d printer prints material in layers also know that nature doesn 't it grows it adds with sophistication creates a highly sophisticated architecture a home inside which to metamorphisize no additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication it does so by combining not two materials but two proteins the silkworm first attaches itself to the environment it creates a tensile structure tension and compression the two forces of life single material in order to better understand how this complex process works we glued a tiny earth magnet to the head of a silkworm and that allowed us to create this 3 dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon we realized it would spin a flat cocoon and it would still healthily and we discovered that the shape the composition the structure of the cocoon was directly informed by the environment we realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon they would healthily healthily we knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas we then created holes or apertures that would lock in the rays of light and heat we ordered six thousand five hundred silkworms from an online silk farm and after four weeks of feeding they were ready to spin with us we placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold and as and he was right they give this entire pavilion its integrity and over two to three weeks six five hundred silkworms spin six thousand five hundred kilometers in a curious symmetry this is also the length of the silk road the moths after they hatch produce one point five million eggs this could be used for two hundred and fifty additional pavilions for the future one spins silk out of a robotic arm the other fills in the gaps to the beginning here 's to a new age of design a new age of creation that takes us from thank you"
