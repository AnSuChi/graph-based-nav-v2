  "transcript": "making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube and this exhibition is the first one i did using paper i just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure it 's very complicated to test the new material for the building but this is much stronger than i expected and also it 's very easy to waterproof and also because it 's industrial this is the first temporary building made out of paper there are three hundred and thirty tubes so i was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes recyclable paper because we create a lot of industrial waste so my building has to be reused or so that was the goal of my design then i wanted to rent an office in paris but i couldn 't afford it so i decided to bring my students to paris so we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the see me they had to buy a ticket to see me that was the problem and i created a big monument for the government but then i was very disappointed at my profession as an architect because we are not helping we are not working for so they hire us to visualize their power and money even now we are so i was very disappointed that we are not working for society but i must say they are no longer natural disasters so that is why i started working in disaster but i was so surprised to just providing a plastic sheet and the refugees had to cut the trees and just like this but over two million people cut trees it just became big heavy deforestation that so i proposed my idea but my budget is only fifty u s dollars per unit we built fifty units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and and the city like this nagata district all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake so i went there and also i proposed to the priests so i proposed to rebuild i raised did fundraising i made a paper tube shelter i used beer crates as a foundation i asked the kirin beer company to propose because at that time the asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red which doesn 't go with the color of the paper tubes the color coordination is very important finally the priest finally he trusted me to rebuild he said as long as you collect money by yourself bring your students to build you can do it so we spent five weeks rebuilding the it was meant to stay there for three years but actually it stayed there ten years because people loved it then in taiwan they had a big earthquake so this building became a permanent building then i wonder what is a permanent and what is a temporary building even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine in turkey the big earthquake i went there to use the local material to build a in two thousand and four in sri lanka after the sumatra earthquake and tsunami rebuilt islamic fishermen 's villages and in two thousand and eight in chengdu sichuan area in china and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor i was asked to rebuild the temporary church i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese in two thousand and nine in italy l 'aquila former prime minister berlusconi and they are very kind affording my model i proposed a big rebuilding so i proposed to the mayor i 'd like to so they helped us to collect money and i got half a million euros from the japanese government to rebuild this temporary year two thousand and ten in haiti there was a big earthquake but it 's impossible to fly in northern japan after the earthquake and tsunami people had to be evacuated in a big room like a so we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain however some of the facility authority doesn 't want us to do it because they said simply it 's become more difficult to control them but it 's really necessary to do it they don 't have enough flat area to so dense multi story building because there 's no land so i proposed to the while i was making partitions finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi he asked me to build three story housing i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building within the budget of the government but also the but much more comfortable many of the people want to stay here forever i was very happy to hear that and the most important cathedral of the city the symbol of and i 'd like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people"
