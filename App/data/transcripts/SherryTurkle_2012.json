  "transcript": "just a moment ago my daughter rebecca texted me for good luck her text said mom you will rock i love this getting that text was like getting a hug and so there you have it i 'm a woman who loves getting texts who 's going to tell you that too many of them actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of i had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and i was about to be on the cover of wired magazine in those heady days we were experimenting with i was excited and as a psychologist what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves about our identity to live better lives in the real world she sleeps with her cellphone so do i and i 've just written a new book i 'm still excited by technology but i believe and i 'm here to make the case that we 're letting it take us places that we don 't want to go over the past fifteen years i 've studied technologies of mobile communication and i 've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people young and old about their plugged in lives and what i 've found is that our little devices those little devices in our pockets are so psychologically powerful that they don 't only change what we do they change who we are we would have found odd or but they 've quickly come to seem familiar they text and shop and go on facebook during classes during presentations actually during all meetings people talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you 're texting people explain to me that it 's hard but that it can be done parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children complain but then these same children deny each other their full attention this is a recent shot of my daughter and her friends being together while not being together i study this we remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones it matters to me because i think we 're setting ourselves up for trouble trouble certainly in how but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for but also elsewhere connected to all the different places they want to be people want to customize their lives they want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you even as we 're all constantly connected to each other a 50 year old business man lamented to me when he goes to work he doesn 't stop by to talk to anybody he doesn 't call and he says he doesn 't want to interrupt his colleagues because he says they 're too busy on their email but then he stops himself you know i 'm not telling you the truth i 'm the one who doesn 't want to be interrupted but actually i 'd rather just do things on my blackberry if and only if they can have each other at a distance in amounts they can control i call it the goldilocks effect not too close not too far but what might feel just right for that middle aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop like to learn how to have a conversation when i ask people what 's wrong with having a conversation people say i 'll tell you what 's wrong with having a conversation it takes place in real time and you can 't control what you 're going to say so that the bottom line texting email posting all of these things let us present the self as we want to be the face the voice the flesh the body not too little not too much just and we clean them up with technology and when we do one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation for mere connection we short change ourselves and over time we seem to forget this or we seem to stop caring caught off guard when stephen colbert asked me a profound question a profound question he said don 't all those little tweets don 't all those little sips of online communication add up to one big gulp of real conversation my answer was no they don 't add up connecting in sips they may work for saying i 'm look at how i felt when i got that text from my daughter and we use conversations with each other so a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for that skill is the bedrock of development over and over i hear i would rather text than talk and what i 'm seeing is that people get so used to being short changed out of real conversation so used to getting by with less that they 've become almost willing to dispense with people altogether many people share with me this wish that some day a more advanced version of siri the digital assistant on apple 's iphone will be more like a best friend someone who will listen when others won 't i believe this wish reflects a painful truth that i 've learned in the past fifteen years that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology that 's why it 's so appealing to have a facebook page or a twitter feed so many automatic listeners and the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us we 're developing robots they call them sociable robots that are specifically designed to be companions to the elderly to our children to us have we so lost confidence that we and i brought in these sociable robots that were designed to give the elderly the feeling and one day i came in and a woman who had lost a child it seemed to be looking in her eyes it seemed to be following the conversation but that woman was trying to make sense of her life and we 're vulnerable people experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing so during that moment it doesn 't know life i didn 't find it but when i stepped back i felt myself at the cold hard center of a perfect storm and i ask myself why have things come to this and i believe it 's because technology appeals to us most we 're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship we turn to technology to help us feel connected but we 're not so comfortable we are not so much in control those phones in our pockets are changing our minds and hearts because they offer us three gratifying fantasies one that we can put our attention wherever we want and that third idea that we will never have to be alone is central to changing our psyches they reach for a device just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved and so people try to solve it by connecting but here connection is more like a symptom but it doesn 't solve an underlying problem but more than a symptom constant connection is changing the way people think of we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we 're having them so before it was i want to have a feeling i need to send a text the problem with this new regime of so what do we do we connect more and more but in the process we set ourselves up to be isolated how do you get from connection to isolation you end up isolated if you don 't cultivate the capacity for solitude the ability to be separate to gather yourself solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive we slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel because actually it 's the opposite that 's true if we 're not able to be alone i said those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of reflection and more than that we 're smitten with technology there 's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it how we build it i 'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices i see some first steps start thinking of solitude as a good thing make room for it find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children create sacred spaces at home the kitchen the dining room and reclaim them for conversation we 're so busy communicating that we often don 't have time to think we don 't have 't have time to talk about the including to the boring bits because it 's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves to each other technology is making a bid to redefine human connection how we care for ourselves and we have the greatest chance of if we recognize our vulnerability that we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and then there 's technology hopeful an ad campaign promises that online and with avatars you can finally love your friends love your body love your life online and with avatars we 're drawn to virtual romance to computer games that seem like worlds to the idea that robots robots will someday be our true companions we spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends but our fantasies of substitution have cost us now we all need to focus on the many many ways technology can lead us back to our real they need us let 's talk about how we can use digital technology the technology of our dreams to make this life the life we can love thank you"
