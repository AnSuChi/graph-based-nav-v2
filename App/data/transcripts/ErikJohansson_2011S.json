  "transcript": "or yet my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of fifteen but it was a bit different because using the camera the process was in the planning instead and so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place photos like this or photos like these both dark and colorful but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick so it 's more about capturing idea than about capturing a moment really is it something about the details or the colors sometimes the but in the end it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two dimensional surface so i think the basics are quite simple i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate and let me show you a simple example they can create something that still looks three dimensional but at the same time we know it can 't so we trick our brains because our brain simply doesn 't accept the fact that it doesn 't really make sense and so i think it 's the things that we don 't even think about the things this is really important to consider so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result but combined they can create something like this so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed matching color contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images adding photographic defects like depth of field desaturated colors and noise we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what 's manipulated but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations i personally think that it 's easier to actually create a place than to find a place because then and yeah i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish so to achieve a realistic result i think it comes down to planning it always starts with a sketch an idea and here and if you do a good job capturing the photos the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic so all the tools are out there and the only thing that limits us"
