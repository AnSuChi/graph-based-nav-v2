  "transcript": "and present my proposal to build a wall across the entire african continent about the size of the great wall of china this would hardly be an invisible structure and yet it 's made from parts that are invisible to the naked eye bacteria and grains of sand now as architects we 're trained to solve problems but i don 't really believe in architectural problems i only believe in opportunities which is why i 'll show you a threat the threat is my response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand stretching across the desert it is simple and complex it is always the same never the same endlessly fascinating one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second new grains break free some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale into a sand dune in a the static stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand but moving mountains can be dangerous let me try and explain why just south of the sahara we find the sahel the name means edge of the desert and this is the region most closely associated with desertification it was here in the late that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid with about up to two hundred and fifty thousand dying this is a catastrophe waiting to happen again and it 's one that gets very little attention in our accelerated media culture desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines it 's nothing like a tsunami and yet desertification is a major threat on all continents affecting some one hundred and ten countries and about seventy percent of the world 's agricultural drylands it seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people and we get droughts increased desertification crashing food systems water scarcity a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously but how far away is it i went to sokoto in northern nigeria to try and find out how how far away it is the dunes here move southward at a pace of around six hundred meters a year that 's the sahara eating up almost [ two meters ] a day of the arable land physically pushing people away from their homes here i am i 'm the second person on the left they had to move this village in one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven as a huge dune threatened to swallow it so they moved the entire village hut by hut this is where the village used to be it took us about ten minutes to climb up to the top of that dune which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location that 's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to if you happen to live close to the desert border you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away and abandon your home and your life as you know it now sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts and still those extreme environments are very good places four years ago twenty three african countries came together to create the great green wall sahara a fantastic project the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the african continent from mauritania in the west all the way to djibouti in the east if you want to stop a sand dune from moving what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest and a good way of doing that the most efficient way is to use some kind of sand catcher trees or cacti are good for this now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won 't get chopped down this sandstone wall that i 'm proposing binding the grains it provides a physical support structure for the trees and it creates physical spaces habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes if people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees protect them from humans and from some of the forces of nature inside of the dunes we find shade and start greening the desert from within and then excavate the sand we can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us so the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us and the answer is perhaps that you use these guys bacillus pasteurii that is readily available in wetlands and marshes and does precisely that it takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out these images from the american society for microbiology show us the process what happens is you pour bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains a chemical process produces calcite which is a kind of natural cement i learned about this from a professor at u c davis called jason dejong he managed to do it in in a mere one thousand four hundred minutes so how much would this cost i 'm not an economist very much not but i did quite literally a we would have to pay in the region of ninety dollars and after an initial cost of sixty bucks to buy the bacteria which you 'll never have to pay again how do we construct something like this well i 'll quickly show you two options the first is to create a kind of balloon structure fill it with bacteria then allow the sand to wash over the balloon we green that part of the desert the second alternative would be to use injection piles so we pushed the piles down through the dune we then pull the piles up through the dune and we 're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes but what should they look like like well i was inspired for my architectural form by tafoni which look a little bit like this this is a model representation of it these are cavernous rock structures that i found on the site in sokoto and i realized that if i scaled them up they would provide me with good part of the and i think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually i think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice we see the result the traces if you like of the bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments some people believe that this would and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them architectural structures made from the desert itself sand stopping devices made from sand the world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century in a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands this could prove and quite frankly we 're putting our heads in the sand if nothing else i would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion but very narrow city in the desert built into the dunescape it 's not only something that supports trees but something that connects people and countries i would like to conclude and leave you with a sentence by by jorge luis borges borges said that nothing is built everything is built on sand but we must build as if the sand"
