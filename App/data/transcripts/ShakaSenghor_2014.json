  "transcript": "i was a young drug dealer with a quick temper but that wasn 't the end of my story in fact it was beginning and the twenty three years since is a story apology but it didn 't happen in the way that you might imagine or think these things occurred in my life in a way that was surprising especially to me see like many of you but things went dramatically wrong when my parents separated i got shot three times standing on the corner of my block in detroit doctors pulled the bullets out patched me up and sent me back to the same neighborhood where i got shot no one counseled me no one told me that i would live in fear that i would become paranoid or hyper violently to being shot no one told me that one day i would become the person behind the trigger fourteen months later at i fired the shots that caused a man 's death when i entered prison i was bitter i blamed everybody from my parents to the 's better to be the shooter unloved i felt like nobody cared and i reacted with hostility to my confinement i loan sharked and i sold drugs that were illegally smuggled into the prison i had in fact become what the warden of the michigan reformatory called the worst of the worst now as i see it solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places you can find yourself but find myself i did when an officer came and delivered i looked at a couple of letters before i looked at the letter that had my son 's squiggly handwriting on it and on this particular day i opened this letter and in capital letters he wrote my mama told me why you was in prison jesus watches what you do pray to him but it was something so profound about my son 's words they made me examine things about my life that i hadn 't considered it was the first time in my life that i had actually thought about the fact that my son would see me as a murderer i sat back on my bunk and i reflected on something i had read in [ plato ] where socrates stated in apology that the unexamined life isn 't worth living but it didn 't come easy of the things i realized which was part of the transformation was that there were four key things the first thing was i had great mentors now but in my case some of my mentors who are serving life sentences were some of the best people to ever come into my life and then i had the great fortune of encountering malcolm x 's autobiography the third thing was family for nineteen years my father stood by my side with an unshakable faith because he believed that i had what it took to turn my life around i also met an amazing woman who is now the mother when i got that letter from my son i began to write a journal and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement earlier in my incarceration i had received a letter from and in that letter she told me she forgave me because she realized i was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships it was the first time in my life that i ever felt open to forgiving myself one of the things that happened after that experience is that i thought about the other men who were incarcerated alongside of me and how much i wanted to share this with them and so i started talking to them about and most of them wanted help and they wanted to turn it but unfortunately the system that currently holds two point five million people in prison is designed to warehouse as opposed to rehabilitate or transform so i made it up in my mind that if i was ever released from prison that i would do everything in my power to help change that now imagine if you will fred flintstone walking into an episode of the jetsons that was pretty much what my life was like social media cars that talk like kitt from knight rider fascinated me the most was phone technology see when i went to prison our car phones were this big and required two people to carry them so imagine what it was like when i first grabbed my little blackberry but the thing is the people around me they didn 't realize that i had no idea what all these abbreviated texts meant like lol with one of my friends via text and i asked him to do something and he responded back k and i was like what is k and he was like k is okay so in my head i was like well what the hell is wrong and i said lol fu as in i finally understand i work for an but it 's been a struggle because i realize that there are more men and women coming home i 've been blessed to work with some amazing men and women helping others reenter society and one of them is my friend named calvin evans he served twenty four years for a crime and one of the things that we talked about is the three things that i found important in my personal transformation the first being acknowledgment i even though i had no expectations of them accepting it it was important to do because it was the right thing but i also had to apologize thing was atoning for me atoning meant going back into my community but also becoming at one with myself the majority of men and women who are incarcerated are fact is ninety percent of the men and women who are incarcerated will at some point return to the community and we have a role in determining what kind of men and women return to our community my wish today that we anybody can have a transformation if we create the space for that to happen so what i 'm asking today is that you envision a world where men and women aren 't held hostage to their pasts where misdeeds and mistakes don 't define you for the rest of your life and i hope you do too"
