  "transcript": "which is a problem we all kind of have but let 's sort of start at the beginning so we have companies and and they expect these people who work for them to do great work i would hope at least at least good work hopefully at least it 's good work so a company or a charity or an organization of any kind unless you 're working in africa or they lease some space and they fill this space with stuff they fill it with tables or desks chairs computer maybe a few other things it seems like it 's perfectly reasonable to to ask that however if you actually talk to people and even question yourself and you ask yourself if you ask people the question where do you need to go when you need to get something done typically you get three different kinds of answers so here are some examples i 've been asking people this question for about ten years where do you go when you really need to get something done i 'll hear things like the and then you 'll hear things like the train it doesn 't really matter where i am as long as it 's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends you almost never hear what is that about and what you find out is if you dig a little bit deeper you find out that people and they 're basically trading in their work day for a series of work moments that 's what happens at the office then you 've got fifteen minutes and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question and you realize that you didn 't get anything done i used the software they told me to use i went to these meetings i was asked to go to but i didn 't actually do anything i just did tasks i didn 't actually get meaningful work done thinkers you cannot ask somebody to be creative in fifteen minutes and really think about a problem you might have a quick idea but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully you need long stretches of uninterrupted time six five four when 's the last time you had three hours to yourself very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office and this is why people choose to do work or they might go to the office but they might go to the office really early in the day or they get work done on the plane now there are different kinds of distractions but not the really bad and this whole phenomenon of having i think that sleep and work are very closely related not because you can work while you 're sleeping and sleep while you 're working that 's not really what i mean if you 're interrupted while you 're going through the early ones if someone bumps you in bed or there 's a sound or whatever happens you don 't just pick up where you left off and what ends up happening you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning or whenever you get up and you 're like but i didn 't really i don 't think anyone would say yes how can we possibly expect people to do their job if they go to the office and are interrupted that doesn 't really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me so what are the interruptions that or you could go for a walk or there 's a fridge downstairs or you 've got your own couch or whatever you want to do if you talk to certain managers they 'll tell you that they don 't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions but that 's one of the excuses that managers give and i 'm one of these managers i understand i know how this goes we all have to improve on this sort of thing but oftentimes they 'll cite distractions i can 't let someone work at home they 'll watch tv or do this other thing because those are voluntary you decide when you want to be distracted by the tv when you want to turn something on or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk so let 's go through a couple of those now managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like facebook and twitter and youtube and in fact they 'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work some of you may work at places where you can 't get to certain sites i mean is this china what the hell is going on here you can 't go to a website at work and that 's the problem that 's why people aren 't getting work done because they 're on facebook and twitter that 's kind of ridiculous it 's a total decoy today 's facebook and twitter and youtube these things are just modern day smoke breaks no one cared about letting the real problems it 's because of the m you don 't find managers and meetings you find a lot of other distractions but not managers and meetings so these are the things that you don 't find elsewhere but you do find at the office interrupting people they don 't really do the work so they make sure everyone else is doing work which is an interruption we have lots of managers in the world now and a lot of people in the world and a lot of interruptions by these managers they have to check in hey how 's it going show me what 's up this sort of thing terrible poisonous things during the day at work and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees it doesn 't work that way the manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together and it 's an incredibly disruptive thing to do i don 't care what you 're doing you 've got to stop doing it so you can have this meeting i mean what are the chances that all ten people are ready to stop all of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else so they go into a meeting room they get together and there 's often too many people in the meetings and they 're very very expensive to the organization companies often think of a one hour meeting as a one hour meeting but that 's not true unless there 's only one person it 's a 10 hour meeting not a one hour meeting you can 't so meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today especially at offices these things don 't exist outside of the office so i have some suggestions to what can managers do enlightened managers hopefully what can they do to make the so that people start to say when i really want to get stuff done i go to the office because the offices are well equipped everything is there for them to do the work but they don 't want to go there right now so how do we change that i have three suggestions to share with you i have about three minutes so that 'll fit perfectly nobody in the office can talk to each other and what you 'll find is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other this is when people is when no one 's bothering them or interrupting them it 's better than a computer better than than a new monitor better than new software or whatever people typically use giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable if you try that 's something that you 'll find will really really work having meetings and replace that with more passive models of communication using things like email and instant messaging or collaboration products things like that but they 're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing you can quit i m you can 't hide your manager you can put these things away and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule at your own time when you 're available when you 're ready to go so you 'll be going up doing some work and then you 'll come down from that work and then maybe it 's time to check that email so if you 're a manager start encouraging people to use more things like i m and email and other things that someone can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule and the last suggestion i have is that if you do have a meeting coming up if you have the power just cancel it just cancel that next meeting laughter usually people have meetings on monday just don 't have it and you 'll find out that everything will be just all these discussions and so those are just three quick suggestions i wanted to give you guys to think about i hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and and people who are in charge of other people to think about laying off a little bit and giving people more time to get work done i think it 'll all pay off in the end so thanks for listening"
