  "transcript": "i grew up watching star trek i love star trek star trek but basically i figured i could find those alien creatures right on earth i 'm obsessed with insects particularly insect flight i think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps one of the most important without insects there 'd be no flowering plants without flowering plants there would be no clever fruit eating primates giving ted talks gave a very compelling the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might might be this for example laughter i don 't want to emphasize on the similarities between humans and fruit flies but rather the differences and focus on the behaviors that that i think fruit flies and so i want to show you a high speed video sequence of a fly shot at seven thousand frames per second in infrared lighting and to the right off screen it is going to extend its legs out it 's going to sashay away now i have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye the fly has has seen this this looming predator estimated its position fly 's brain can process information you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight and you need a controller and in the first human aircraft the controller was basically the brain of of orville and wilbur sitting in the cockpit now how does this compare to a fly well i spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air and you might have heard how engineers proved that but they don 't and we we tackle this dynamically scaled model robot insects that would flap in giant and it turns out that the insects flap their wings in a very clever way at a very high angle of attack that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing a little tornado like structure called a leading edge vortex and it 's that that vortex that actually enables the wings to make but the thing that 's actually most so what 's fascinating is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology what 's clever is the way and this is what enables flies to perform these remarkable means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a it 's specialized to generate the the enormous power required for flight and it fills the middle portion of the fly so when a fly hits your windshield it 's basically the power muscle that you 're looking at but attached to the base of the wing is a set of little tiny control muscles that are that are not very powerful at all but they 're very fast and they 're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing on a stroke by stroke the they have they have another set of eyes on the top of their head we have no they have sensors on their their wing their wing is covered with with sensors including they can even taste with their wings one of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has is a structure called the halteres the halteres are actually gyroscopes these devices beat back and forth about two hundred hertz during flight and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation and initiate very very fast corrective maneuvers but all of this sensory and yes indeed flies have a brain a brain of about one hundred thousand neurons now people at this conference have already suggested that fruit flies could serve i don 't think they 're a simple and i think that flies are a great model they 're a great model which is much but this is the most common form of brain on the planet and has been for four hundred million years and is it fair to say that it 's simple well it 's simple so let 's sort of think about this i think we have to compare we have to compare the size of the brain and the trump number is the ratio of of this man 's behavioral repertoire to the number neurons in his brain we 'll calculate the trump number for the fruit fly now how many people here think the trump number is higher for the for the fruit fly it 's a very smart smart audience yes the inequality goes in this direction or i would posit it now i realize that it a little bit absurd to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly but let 's take take another animal just as an example here 's a mouse a mouse has about and then something happened when i started to work on flies and i think if you compare the natural they have to engage in courtship i 'm going to show you a sequence and i have to say so i 'm showing this classified sequence and you cannot discuss it outside of this room okay so i want you to look at the payload watch it very closely wait for it pshhew so at least you 'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice they 're at least as clever as pigeons now i want to get across that it 's not just a matter of numbers but but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons so this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse that came from from jeff lichtman 's lab and you can see the wonderful images up in the corner in the right corner you 'll see at the same scale a visual interneuron from and it 's a beautifully complex neuron it 's just very very tiny and there 's lots of biophysical challenges with trying to compute information with tiny tiny neurons how small can look at this interesting insect it looks sort of like a fly it has wings it has eyes it but not only is its so here 's some other organisms at the similar scale this animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba and it has a brain of seven thousand neurons that 's so small you know these things called cell bodies you 've been hearing so this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience i would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works but let 's think about this how can you make a small number of neurons do a lot and i think from you think of multiplexing you can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times or have different parts of the hardware doing different things and these are the two concepts i 'd like to explore and they 're not concepts that that i 've come up with but concepts that have have been but i 'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing crab chewing is actually really fascinating crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill that grinds their food in a variety of different ways and here 's an an endoscopic movie of this this structure the amazing thing about this is that it 's controlled by a really tiny set of about two dozen neurons and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion in the crab and they 're able to generate work by eve marder and her many colleagues who 've been studying this fascinating system that show how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many many many things because of another set of cells and you can imagine you could extrapolate to a very very complicated system is there any evidence that flies do this well for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world we 've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators you can tether a fly to a little stick you can measure the aerodynamic forces it 's creating you can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display so let me show you a little tiny sequence of this and this is a game the flies love to play you allow them to steer towards the little stripe and they it 's been possible to and it 's basically a flight simulator but under and this is what one of these experiments looks like it was a sequence taken from another post doc in the and you 'll see the fly start to fly and the fly is actually controlling the rotation of that and you can see this visual interneuron respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies so for the first time we 've actually been able to record from neurons in the fly 's brain while the fly is performing flight and one of the lessons we 've been learning is that the physiology of cells that we 've been studying for many years in quiescent flies is not the same as the physiology of those cells when the flies actually engage in active behaviors like flying and walking and so forth and why is the the physiology different well it turns out it 's these neuromodulators just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs so here 's a picture of the octopamine system octopamine is a neuromodulator so i really think that as we we learn it 's going to turn out that the the whole fly brain is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion and that 's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons now another idea another way of multiplexing is multiplexing in space having different parts of a neuron do different things at the same time so here 's two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an invertebrate a human pyramidal neuron from ramon y cajal and another cell to the right a and this is the work of of alan watson and malcolm burrows many years ago and malcolm burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials it 's a non spiking cell so a typical cell like the neurons in our brain has a region called the dendrites that receives input and that input sums together and will produce action potentials that run down the axon and then activate all the output regions of the neuron but non spiking neurons are actually quite complicated so there 's a possibility that you have computational compartments that allow the different parts of the neuron to do different things at the same of multitasking in time i think these are things that are true in our brains as well but i think the insects are the true masters of this so i hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time and as i say up here please think before you swat"
