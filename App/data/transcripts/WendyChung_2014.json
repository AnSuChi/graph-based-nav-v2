  "transcript": "is a question that parents ask me all the time why did my child develop autism as a pediatrician as a geneticist as a researcher we try and address that question but autism is not a single condition it 's actually a spectrum of disorders a spectrum that ranges for instance from justin a 13 year old boy who 's not verbal who can 't speak who communicates by using an ipad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and his concerns a little boy who when he gets upset will he has great difficulty he actually shuts down yet both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder one of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic and the question is why does this graph look this way has that number been increasing dramatically over time simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources with access to educational materials that would help them more educators learned to recognize the features of autism as a result of that more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the and that accounts for some of the increased prevalence that we see but let me be very clear vaccines do not cause autism and that author a physician physician had his medical license taken away from him the institute of medicine the centers for disease control have repeatedly investigated this and there is no credible evidence one of the ingredients in vaccines something called thimerosal was thought to be what the cause of autism was that was actually removed from vaccines based on epidemiological data we know that one of the causes or one of the associations i should say is advanced paternal age that is increasing age of the father at the time of conception in addition there can be some infectious agents that can also but it 's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene one of the genetic factors that we don 't understand however is the difference that we see in terms of males and females males are affected four to one and we really don 't understand what that cause is versus and when you look at those concordance ratios one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins that concordance rate is seventy seven percent it is not that genes account for all of the risk for but yet they account for a lot of that risk because when you look at fraternal twins that concordance rate is only thirty one percent suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone so this provides some of the data that autism is genetic well how genetic is it when we compare it to other conditions that we 're familiar with heart disease diabetes in fact genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions genetic it 's genetic that is that it 's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism running in the family and the reason is because in certain individuals they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father but actually start brand new in them and we can actually use that strategy to now understand and to identify those genes causing autism in those individuals and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases to do that we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those but i 'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information our genetic information is organized into a set of and so we had to start opening those books and in some cases the genetic change was more subtle it might have been a single paragraph that was missing or yet even more subtle than that a single letter we were able to account for approximately twenty five percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families on the other hand there 's seventy five percent that we still haven 't figured out as we did this though it was really quite humbling and that explains in part why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects but in fact they fit together they fit together in a pathway they fit together in a network that 's starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions we understanding how those neurons interact together to make circuits work and understand how those circuits work to now control behavior and understand that both in individuals with autism as well as individuals who have normal cognition and so folks like ami klin have developed methods to be able to take infants small babies and be able to use biomarkers in this case eye contact and eye tracking to identify an infant at risk this particular infant you can see making very good eye contact on the other hand this other baby is going to go on to develop autism in this particular child you can see it 's not making good eye contact instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection looking at the mouth looking at the nose but not again socially connecting through something very robust very reliable is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact how are we going to intervene it and so in fact identifying the genes for autism beyond that there are a lot of individuals in this room who have great ideas in terms of new technologies we can use everything from devices we can use to train the brain to be able to make it more efficient and to compensate for areas in which it has a little bit of trouble and have a coach be able to help him be able to help think about conversations being able to even perhaps one day invite a girl out on a date be able to help think about be able to make"
