  "transcript": "that would cause me a reticent midwestern scientist to get myself arrested and what would you do if you knew what i know let 's start with how i got to this point i was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university and i was really lucky to go to the university of iowa where i could study under professor james van allen who built instruments for the first u s satellites professor van allen told me about observations of venus that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that venus had an ionosphere or was venus extremely hot confirmed by the soviet venera spacecraft was that venus was very hot nine hundred degrees fahrenheit and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere i was fortunate to join nasa and successfully propose an experiment to fly to venus but while our instrument was being built i became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect i resigned as principal investigator on our venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important its changes will affect all of humanity the greenhouse effect had been well understood british physicist john tyndall in the one thousand eight hundred and fifty 's made laboratory measurements thus acting like a blanket we published an article in science magazine concluding that observed warming of zero point four degrees celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing co2 that earth would likely warm in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled northwest passage all of these impacts have since either happened or are now well under that paper was reported on the front page of the new york times and led to me testifying to congress in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's testimony in which i emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the earth 's water cycle but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy rainfall will become in more there will be stronger storms and greater flooding global warming hoopla became time consuming and distracted me from doing science partly because i had complained that the white house altered my testimony so i decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others fifteen years later evidence of global warming was much stronger most of the things mentioned in our one thousand nine hundred and eighty one paper were facts i had the privilege to speak twice but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels by then we had two grandchildren and connor i decided that i did not want them in the future to say opa understood what was happening but he didn 't make it clear i gave the talk at the university of iowa in two thousand and four and at the two thousand and five meeting of the american geophysical union this led to calls from the white house to nasa headquarters and i was told that i could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by nasa headquarters but there were i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted never to appear again over the next few years i was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics first from earth 's energy balance it reduces earth 's heat radiation to space so there 's a temporary energy imbalance more energy is coming in than going out earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the sun so the key quantity is earth 's energy imbalance is there more energy coming in than going out if so more warming is in the pipeline it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses now finally we can measure earth 's energy the biggest reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until more than three thousand argo floats were distributed around the world 's ocean the deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate and energy is the total energy imbalance now is about six tenths of a watt per square meter it 's about twenty times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity it 's equivalent to exploding four hundred thousand hiroshima atomic bombs per day three hundred and sixty five days per year that 's how much extra energy earth is gaining each day this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum there was more energy coming in than going out this shows that the effect of the sun 's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses mainly from burning fossil fuels now consider earth 's climate history these curves for global temperature atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over eight hundred thousand years forming a two mile thick ice sheet as you see there 's a high correlation between temperature co2 and sea level careful examination shows that the by a few centuries climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes co2 to change not vice versa small changes in earth 's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the shrinking ice sheets so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer a warmer ocean releases co2 just as a warm coca cola does ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today the physics does not change as earth warms now while we can 't say unless we stop the warming there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning precise measurements by grace the gravity satellite reveal that both greenland and antarctica several hundred cubic kilometers per year and the rate has accelerated methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost what sea level rise can we look forward to where you are sitting now would be under water i think it will be more if we keep burning fossil the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity 's control the economic consequences are almost unthinkable hundreds of new devastations around the world what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species the monarch butterfly could be one of the twenty to fifty percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use global warming is already affecting people mexico heatwave and drought last year moscow the year before and europe in two thousand and three were all exceptional events more than three standard deviations outside the norm fifty years ago covered only two to three tenths of one percent of the land area in recent years because of global warming they now cover about ten percent an increase by a factor of twenty five to fifty so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe texas and moscow heatwaves were not they were caused by global warming the midwest and great plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts if we let global warming continue how did i get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate giving talks in getting arrested burning up the vacation time that i had accumulated over thirty years more grandchildren helped me along here at age two and a half years he thinks he can protect his two and a leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed one hundred percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis with the government not keeping one dime this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future leaves energy sounds like a conservative climate plan to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society our governments thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal longwall mining fracking tar sands tar shale deep ocean guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations a large fraction of species will be committed to extinction and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world causing massive famines imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with earth that is the equivalent taking no action to divert the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it becomes if we had started in two thousand and five it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century it is six percent per year it is fifteen percent per year extremely difficult and expensive perhaps impossible but we aren 't even i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions thank you"
