  "transcript": "these rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years and are responsible for much of whats gone on on our planet this is an example of a real meteorite and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat a meteorite hits the earth and just how much of it survives and melts and it wouldnt be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back on apollo eleven the astronauts each got to carry about ten silk so thats for fun you can see how portable and handy it was to have your own guttenberg you see the book was not driven by reading so youre looking here at one of the first printed books using movable type in the history of man five hundred and fifty years ago we are living where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it but why is this so interesting heres the quick story and so they actually hand wrote these things called indulgences which were forgivenesss on pieces of paper they traveled all around europe and and so all of western europe started buying printing presses in to print out thousands and then hundreds of thousands and then ultimately millions of single small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven that is why the printing press succeeded and that is why martin luther nailed his ninety theses to the door because he was complaining that the catholic church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of western europe so the printing press ladies and gentlemen was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading more tomorrow i also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures were going to have some tomorrow applause instead of showing an object from the stage im going to do something special for the first time we are going to show actually what the library looks like ok so i am married to the most wonderful woman in the world youre going to find out why in a minute because when i went to see eileen this is what i said i wanted to build this is the library of human imagination the room itself is three stories tall in the glass panels are five thousand years of human imagination that are computer controlled the room is a theatre it changes colors and all throughout the library are different objects different spaces its designed like an escher print here is some of the lower level of the library where the exhibits constantly change you can walk through you can touch you can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room theres my very own saturn v everybody should ok so you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects in the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination there is a glass bridge that you walk across thats suspended in space so its a leap of imagination how do we create part of the question that i have answered is is we create by surrounding surrounding ourselves with stimuli with human achievement with history with the things that drive us and make us human the passionate discovery the bones of dinosaurs so hopefully tomorrow ill show one or two more objects and eileen and i are thrilled to open our home and share it with the ted community ted is all about patterns in the clouds its all about connections its all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before and thats really what discovery and imagination is all about but we can also look at an enigma machine from the nazis in world war ii that was a coding and decoding machine now these two molecules code and decode and yet looking at them you would see a machine you realize that both of these things really are connected and theyre connected primarily because of this here you see this is a human brain model ok and its rare because we never really get to see a brain we get to see a skull but there it is all of imagination everything that we think we feel we sense comes through the human brain and once we create new patterns in this brain once we shape the brain in a new way it never returns to its original shape"
