  "transcript": "let 's talk dirty and i found one a public and it was where does this stuff go i found myself plunged into the world of yet engaging place to be to go back to that toilet it wasn 't a particularly fancy toilet it wasn 't as nice as this one from the world and we do that when i asked that question i learned something and that was that i 'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right when in fact it 's a privilege because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit all those things the eggs cysts the bacteria the viruses all those can travel in one gram of human feces and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet in what i call the it 's but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a in a leading photo photo image agency this is the picture that you come up with and here 's another image of diarrhea this is marie saylee nine months old because she 's buried under that green grass in a little village in because she died in three days from diarrhea and that 's her dad and you 've probably been asked to care about things like hiv aids or t b or measles two hundred and sixty billion dollars lost every year on the on the losses to poor sanitation these are cholera beds in haiti you 'll have heard of but we know how to fix this we know because in the mid 19th century child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history the flush toilet was but i think that it 's so good it doesn 't smell we can put it in our house we can lock it behind a door and i think we 've locked it out of conversation have a neutral word for it poop 's not particularly adequate shit offends people feces is too medical because i can 't explain otherwise when i look at the figures what 's going on but if you look at the budgets of countries developing and developed because you 'll expect absurdities like pakistan spending forty seven times more on its but then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget but the humble reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water and i think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us and i understand that who can blame them so if you met an educationalist and said i can improve education attendance rates by twenty five percent with just one simple thing you 'd make a lot of friends in education that we ingest nutrients we excrete nutrients as well we don 't keep them all in rwanda now getting seventy five percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners ' bowels they 're genocidal inmates most of them and they 're stirring the contents of their own latrines because if you put poop in a sealed environment in a tank but and they 've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible infinite and free at the point of production it 's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives here 's a woman who 's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes which is what you think it is and it 's resistant to antibiotics in many cases she 's been suffering for years she gets a dose of healthy human feces and the cure rate maybe it 's the ick factor that 's okay because there 's a team of research scientists in canada who have now created a stool sample a fake stool sample which is called repoopulate so you 'd be thinking by now okay the solution 's simple so they 've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they 've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms they tried selling soap as healthy no one bought it they tried selling selling it as sexy everyone bought it in india now there 's a campaign which persuades no i do and she was engaged at fourteen and then at and she was scared she was scared of drunks she left and if you know anything about rural india you 'll know that 's an unspeakably courageous thing to do and now she goes around all the other villages in india persuading other women to do the same thing it 's what i call social contagion and it 's really powerful and really exciting another version of this another village in india near where priyanka lives this village called lakara and about a year ago it had no toilets whatsoever kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera some visitors came using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other somehow people who 'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all this boy 's mother even though these are pretty exciting times because we 've got the bill and melinda gates foundation reinventing the toilet which is great which is great for humanity very bad for his colon providing people with sanitation at this rate so when i get sad about because japan seventy years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks and now it 's a nation of what are called woshurettos washlet toilets they have in built bidet nozzles for a lovely hands free cleaning experience and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid raising device which is known as the japan which i find so inspirational is they 've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door they 've made it conversational people go out and upgrade their toilet they talk about it they 've sanitized it i hope that we can do that it 's not a difficult thing to do all we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent and that 's to go out thank you"
