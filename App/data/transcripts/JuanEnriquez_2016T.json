  "transcript": "and we can evolve bacteria and we can evolve plants and we can evolve and we 're now reaching a point where we really have to ask is it really ethical and do we want to evolve human beings and as you 're thinking about that let me talk about that in the context of prosthetics no problem he just made a suit of armor put it on perfect prosthetic that 's where the concept of ruling with an iron fist comes from and of course these prosthetics have been getting you can have all types of controls and as you 're thinking about that there are wonderful people like hugh herr who have been building absolutely extraordinary prosthetics so the wonderful aimee mullins will go out and or so these external prosthetics have now become artificial knees they 've become and then they 've evolved further to become not just nice to have but essential to have so when you 're talking about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic you 're talking about something that isn 't just i 'm missing my leg it 's if i don 't have this i can die and at that point a prosthetic becomes a symbiotic relationship with the human body and four of the smartest people that i 've ever met ed boyden hugh herr joe jacobson bob lander and one of the other sides of ed is he 's been thinking about how to connect the brain using light or other mechanisms directly to things like these prosthetics and if you can do that then you can begin and of course if you have nerves that are external or prosthetic then you can increase that diameter and you could even increase it theoretically to the point where as long as you could see the muzzle flash flash you could step out of the way of a bullet those are the order of magnitude of changes you 're talking about this is a fourth sort of level of prosthetics these are phonak hearing aids and the reason why these are so interesting is because they cross the threshold from where prosthetics are something for somebody who is disabled and they become something that somebody who is normal might want to actually have because what this prosthetic does which is really interesting is not only does it help you hear you can focus your hearing so it can hear the conversation going on over there so this functions as your hearing aid and also as your phone and at that point somebody might actually want to have a prosthetic and it 's about time we ask the question how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two and for that we turn to a great philosopher who was a very smart man despite being a yankee fan yogi berra used to say of course that it 's very tough to make predictions especially about the future so instead of making a prediction about the future to begin with let 's take what 's happening in the present with people like tony atala and maybe the ultimate prosthetic isn 't having something external titanium maybe the ultimate prosthetic is take your own gene code remake your own body parts and one of the things that we 've been doing is trying to figure out how to reprogram cells so if you can change the cells in those organs maybe you make those organs more radiation resistant maybe you make them more oxygen maybe you make them more efficient to filter out stuff that you don 't want in your body and over the last few weeks george church has been in the news a lot because he 's been talking about taking one of these programmable cells and inserting an entire human genome and once you can insert an entire human genome into a then you begin to ask the question would you want to enhance any of that genome and all of a sudden what we 're doing is we 've got this multidimensional chess board or we can change the gene code through gene therapy to do away with some hereditary diseases or we can change the environment and change the expression of those genes in the epigenome and all of a sudden it 's not just one little bit it 's all these stacked little bits that allow you to take little portions of it until all the portions coming together lead you to something that 's very different and a lot of people are very scared by this stuff the answer lies in part with lord so what does that mean it means if you take any one of your bodies but fortunately it 's only about eighty percent effective so as a great physicist once said there 's these little upstream eddies of biology that create order in this rapid torrent there 's these upstream eddies that create biological order now the problem with eddies is they tend to disappear they shift they move in rivers and when you have potentially extinction level events like the next election and by the way that 's happened five times on earth and therefore it is very likely that the human species on earth is going to go extinct someday maybe in november but maybe ten thousand years after that as you 're thinking of the consequence of that if you believe that extinctions are common and natural and normal and occur periodically it becomes a moral imperative to diversify our species it becomes a moral imperative because mom and dad coming together to make one cell in a cascade to ten trillion cells we don 't know if you change the gravity substantially if the same thing will happen to create your body so as you 're thinking of that you have to really redesign things just to get to mars forget about the moons of neptune or jupiter and to borrow from so life one civilization is a civilization that begins to alter his or her looks and we 've been doing that for thousands of years you 've got tummy tucks and you 've got this and you 've got that you alter your looks and i 'm told that not all of those alterations take place for medical reasons laughter seems odd a life two civilization is a different civilization a life two civilization alters fundamental aspects so you put human growth hormone in the person grows taller or you put x in and the person gets fatter or loses metabolism or does a whole series of things but you 're altering the functions in a fundamental way to become an and that looks very different from what we 've got here maybe you splice in deinococcus radiodurans and one of the interesting things that 's happened in the last decade is we 've discovered a whole lot of planets out there the problem is if we ever want to get to these planets then you 're talking about something that is very different because you have to change the timescale now we can 't even begin to imagine what that might look like but we 're beginning to get glimpses and let me give you two examples so this is the wonderful floyd romesberg and one of the things so all life on this planet so and that means that you now have a parallel system to make life to make babies to reproduce to evolve that doesn 't mate with most things on earth or in fact maybe with nothing on earth but why is that so interesting it means that we are not a unique solution it means you can create alternate chemistries to us that could be chemistries adaptable to a very different planet if you don then you go from twenty building blocks to one hundred and seventy two and all of a sudden you 've got one hundred and seventy two building blocks of amino acids to build life forms in very different shapes the so this guy has been transplanting hundreds of mouse heads and why is that an interesting experiment well think of the first heart transplants one of the things they used to do is they used to bring in the wife or the daughter of the donor so the donee could tell the doctors do you recognize this person do you love this person do you feel anything for this person we laugh because we know the heart is a muscle but for hundreds of thousands of years or tens of thousands of years i gave her my heart she took my heart she broke my heart we thought this was emotion if you can get a mouse then you can see and boy does that have implications then you can transplant memory and consciousness and then the really interesting question is if you can transplant this is the only input output mechanism this down here or could you transplant that consciousness into something that would be very different that would last in space that would last tens of thousands of years that would be a completely redesigned body that could hold consciousness for a long long period of 's come back to the first question why would you ever want to do that because this is the ultimate selfie and if that little and the reason you want to alter the human body is because you eventually want a picture that says and that 's the reason why it turns out it 's actually unethical but it 's what 's going to allow us to explore live but which our"
