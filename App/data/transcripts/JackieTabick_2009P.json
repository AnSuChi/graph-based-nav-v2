  "transcript": "so when i thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where he 's lying there and he says the only trouble is the people next door i can 't stand them this in a way is of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea we all i think believe in compassion if so in judaism we have from our torah that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself and within jewish teachings the rabbinic teachings have hillel who taught that you shouldn 't do to others what you don 't like being done to yourself who is called the compassionate one ha rachaman after all how could the world exist without god being compassionate and we as but what does it mean how does it impact on our everyday life sometimes of course being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are i know there are many times and i am overwhelmed by the sadness by the so that tears come to my eyes if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings i wouldn 't be doing my job because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen that practicalities are seen to and yet on the other hand if i didn 't feel this compassion then i feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi and these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world who be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war you know there 's just so much out there i can 't do anything i 'm not going to even begin to try and there are some charity workers who call this compassion there are others who feel they can 't confront compassion and so they turn off the television and don 't watch there has to be a middle way you have to of course be aware of the needs of but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people so part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick and of course you can 't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more and there 's a lovely rabbinic which says that when god thought that it would be best to create the world and then god looked to the future and realized if the world was created just with justice world couldn 't exist so god thought nope i 'm going to create the world just with compassion and then god looked to the future and realized that in fact if the world were just filled with compassion there would be anarchy and chaos there had to be limits the rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful fragile glass bowl if you put too much cold water in it will and so god put both of these possibilities into the world there is something more though that has to be there and that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world into action so like and so there is also within judaism this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important chesed the idea of justice which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a social justice but not of course at the expense you know there 's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things and balancing them all in the middle which has to be there if you like at our very roots this idea of compassion comes who is ultimately the compassionate one what does this compassion entail it entails understanding the pain of the other but even more than that it means understanding one 's connection to the whole of creation that there is a unity that underlies all that we see all that we hear and that that unity is something that connects all of creation and of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we 're becoming even more aware that something i do here that if i use too much of my carbon allowance it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain and i have to understand that and i have to understand understand that i find quite fascinating because in judaism stands for life the word this is what 's important in terms of compassion but something else as well actually eighteen minutes is important because at passover when we have to eat unleavened bread the rabbis say what is the difference between dough that is made into bread and dough that is made into unleavened bread what does it mean dough becomes leaven it means it gets filled with hot air what the rabbis say what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air our pride pride our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world and that everything should revolve round us so we try and get rid of those and so doing try to get rid of the habits the emotions the ideas that enslave that make our eyes give us tunnel vision so we don 't see the needs of others and free ourselves and free ourselves from that and that too is a basis now there is gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day and as many people do he was dozing off during the sermon and as he was dozing off they were reading from the book of leviticus and they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in jerusalem the priests used to have bread and he woke up he said god wants bread that 's it god wants bread i know what god wants and he rushed after the sabbath he made opened the ark and said god i don 't know why you want this bread but here you are and he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the torah the cleaner came into the synagogue god you 've answered my plea you 've answered my question meanwhile the rich man thinks to himself who rules the entire universe wants my bread he rushes to the synagogue i 'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it he goes in there and it 's not there next week with raisins went on until a new rabbi came rabbis always spoil things the rabbi came in and he said you know this is what 's happening you mean god didn 't want my bread and the poor man said and you mean god didn 't answer my pleas and the rabbi said you 've misunderstood me you 've misunderstood totally he said of course what you are doing he said to the rich man is answering god 's plea that we should be compassionate and god he said to the poor man is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give he looked at the rich man he held the rich man 's hands and said don 't you understand he so that is the way i feel that i can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate of understanding that there is a connectivity that there is a unity in this world that i want to try and serve but understanding that there are limits that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them and that i have to understand that there are limits to my energy to the giving i can give i have to reevaluate them try and separate out so that i can see the world clearly"
