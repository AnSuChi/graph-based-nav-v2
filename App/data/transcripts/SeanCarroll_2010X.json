  "transcript": "and if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky and you just keep the shutter open as long as your camera is attached to the hubble space telescope it will see something like this every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our milky way a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs there are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe one hundred billion is the only number you need to know the age of the universe between now and the big bang is a hundred billion in dog years but we would also like to understand it as a cosmologist i want to ask why is the universe like this one big clue we have is that the universe is it would be moving away from you and if you look at a galaxy even farther away it would be moving away faster that kind of makes sense to us you might think that that 's not a surprise the air in this room is very smooth you might say well maybe things just smoothed themselves out but the conditions near the big bang are very very different than the conditions of the air in this room in particular things were a lot denser the gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the big bang what you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies a hundred billion stars each at early times those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big literally at early times and you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else because if there had been they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole keeping the universe very very smooth at early times is not easy it 's a delicate arrangement it 's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly there is something that made it that way we would like to know what you 've heard of entropy the randomness the disorder the chaoticness of some systems boltzmann gave us a formula engraved on his tombstone now so that macroscopically it looks the same if you have the air in this you don 't notice each individual atom a low entropy configuration is one in which there 's only a few arrangements that look that way a high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way this is a crucially important the reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy that 's a wonderful insight but it leaves something out the difference between the past and the future every difference that there is the fact that you always in that order that 's because entropy is increasing what he didn 't explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place the fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very very smooth we 'd like to understand that that 's our job as cosmologists not a problem that we 've been giving enough attention to it 's not one of the first things people would say if you asked a modern cosmologist what are the problems we 're trying to address one of the people who did understand that this was a problem was richard feynman fifty years ago he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures he gave the popular lectures that became the character of physical law he gave lectures to caltech the feynman lectures on physics he gave lectures to caltech graduate students that became the feynman lectures on gravitation so he says i 'm not going to do the accent he says for some reason the universe at one time had a very low entropy for its energy content and since then the entropy has increased the arrow time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding so that 's our job we want to know this is fifty years ago surely you 're thinking we 've figured it out by now we learned that it 's accelerating the universe is not only expanding it will be moving away faster it 's just the idea that empty space itself whether or not there 's particles matter radiation or whatever there 's still energy even in the space itself it is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other because unlike matter or radiation does not dilute away as the universe expands the amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same even as the universe gets bigger and bigger back when i was your age we didn 't know what the universe was going to do some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future einstein was fond of this idea meanwhile for all intents and purposes space looks finite to us space may be finite or infinite but because the universe is space is limited to us finally empty space has a temperature in the 1970s stephen hawking told us that a black hole even though you think it 's black it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics and the black hole radiates the energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations and so even though the universe will last forever well what is the implication of that that implication was studied by boltzmann back in the 19th century he said well entropy increases but that 's that would happen everything that is allowed every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules so boltzmann says look you could start with a universe he didn 't know about the big bang he didn 't know about the expansion of the universe he thought that space and time were explained by isaac newton they were absolute they just stuck there forever but if you 're boltzmann you know that if you wait long and then of course in the natural course of things they will expand back well if that 's true boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern sounding ideas the multiverse and the anthropic principle the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can so there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states and then they relax back but there will also be large fluctuations occasionally you will make a planet maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time carl sagan once famously said that in order to make an apple pie you must first first invent the universe that will happen much more frequently than the random so this scenario makes predictions and the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal even if you imagine that this it 's much easier for all those this scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation even if you left our galaxy out you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies and feynman also if our order were due to a fluctuation we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it we therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation so that 's good the question is then what is the right answer if the universe is not a and i would love to tell you the answer but i 'm running out of time here is the universe that we tell you about versus the universe that really exists i just showed you this picture the universe is expanding for the last ten billion years but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more if the dark energy remains around but even black holes don 't last forever they will evaporate and we will be left with nothing but empty space that empty space lasts essentially so here 's two questions for you number one if the universe lasts for ten to the ten to the one hundred and twenty years comfortable afterglow of the big bang why aren 't we in empty space you could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness why aren 't you more homework assignment for you just like that there is no explanation this is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions how surprising to find this low entropy gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations if that 's true it would happen more than once we would be part of a much bigger multiverse that 's my favorite so the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation my bold speculation is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history and fifty years from now all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities we will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse and even better we will understand what happened at the big bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations thank you"
