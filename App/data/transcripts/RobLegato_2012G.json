  "transcript": "i worked on a film called apollo thirteen and when i worked on this film i discovered something about how our brains work and how our brains work is that when we 're sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever it changes and alters our perception of things it changes what we see it changes what we remember and as an experiment because i dauntingly create a task for myself of recreating a saturn v launch because i i put it out there i felt a little nervous about it so i need to do an experiment and bring a group of people like this in a projection room and play this stock footage and when i played this stock simply wanted to find out what should i actually try to replicate what should i try to and what i discovered is because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we 're doing this film there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various what was your memorable shots they changed them they were i mean what the hell were you looking at just a few minutes ago and how come and what i discovered is what i should do is not actually replicate what they saw is replicate what they remembered so this is our and then the combination of all the different shots and all the different things put together created their sort of collective consciousness of what they remembered it looked like but not what it really looked like so this is what we created for apollo thirteen launch so literally what you 're seeing now is the confluence of a bunch of different people a bunch of different memories including my own of taking a little bit of liberty but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots which gives you a sense of distance so i was basically was setting up something that would remind you of something you haven 't really quite seen before and then i 'm going to show you exactly what it is that you were reacting to when you were reacting to fire and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that i just showed you what you were reacting to what you 're emoting to is something that 's a total falsehood and i found that really kind of fascinating and you know the weight of achieving it was simply take a model throw it out of a helicopter and shoot it following the rocket all the way down and giving that little sort of edge i was desperately trying to so then i come up to the next thing we had a nasa consultant who was actually an astronaut who was actually on some of the missions of and he was there to basically double check my science i guess somebody thought they needed to do that but they thought they did so we were he 's a hero he 's an astronaut and we 're all sort of excited and you know i gave myself the liberty of saying you know some of the shots i did and so i showed him some shots we were working on and which is what i got it 's what you dream about so what i got from him is he turned to me and said you would never ever design a rocket like that you would never have a rocket go up while the gantry arms are going out can you imagine the tragedy that could possibly happen with that you would never ever design a rocket like that and he was looking at me it 's like yeah i don 't know if you noticed but i 'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of america 's finest moments with fire extinguishers so and the reaction i got was interesting and what happened was i mean what i sort of intuned in that is that he remembered because he 's sitting in a rocket that has like a hundred thousand pounds of thrust built by the lowest bidder he was hoping it was going to work out okay so he twisted his memory around now ron howard ran into buzz aldrin who was not on the movie so he had he had no idea that we were faking any of this footage and he just responded what vault did you find that stuff in and i said well no vault buzz we generated all that from scratch and he said huh that 's pretty good can we use it doesn 't end well jim cameron actually photographed the real titanic so he basically set up or basically shattered the suspension of disbelief because what he photographed was the real thing a mir sub going down or actually two mir subs going down to the real wreck it 's really beautiful and it conjures up all these various different emotions but he couldn 't photograph everything and it was and i 'll describe my sort of reactions when i was looking at it for the very first time i got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life i automatically wanted to see this this this magnificent ship basically in all its glory and conversely i wanted to see it so i conjured up an effect that i 'm later going to show you what i tried to do which is kind of the heart of the movie for me and i 'll show you you know another thing that i found interesting is what we when you take a look at it so here 's the behind the scenes a couple of little shots here so when you saw my footage and the little mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs and shot in smoke jim went three miles went down and i went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage and so but what you 're emoting to or what you 're looking at had the same feeling the same haunting quality that jim 's footage had so i found it so fascinating that and it 's totally artificial it 's totally make believe and it caused me to create the next effect that i 'll show you which is this sort of magic transition all i was really attempting to do is basically have the audience cue the effect so it became a seamless experience for them that i wasn 't showing you my sort of interpretation i was showing you what you wanted to see and the very next shot right after this so you can if there 's two subs in the same shot i shot it because where 's the camera coming from and when jim shot it it was only one sub because he was photographing from the other and i don 't remember if i did this or jim did this i 'll give it to jim because he could use the pat on the back so now the titanic transition so this is what i was referring to where i wanted to basically magically transplant from one state of the titanic to the other shot once and what i was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you gloria stuart that was the last time titanic ever saw and then i would run it every day and then i would find exactly the moment that i stopped looking at them and start noticing the rest of it and the moment my eye shifted we just marked it to the frame the moment my eye shifted and so i 'll just show it one more time and us which is because it really wanted to be a ghostly last time i ever saw daylight it was a long film to work on now hugo was another interesting movie because the movie itself is about film illusions it 's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture and one of the things i had to do is we sasha baron cohen is a very clever very smart guy and he wanted his his leg brace to get caught on a moving train very dangerous very impossible to do and particularly on our stage because there literally is no way to actually and then i basically used the trick video of what you 're looking at there which is our little test so that 's actually what you 're seeing part of the homage of the of the movie itself is is coming up with this sort of genius trick which i can 't take credit for i 'd love to but i can 't because it was invented like in one thousand nine hundred and ten or something like that is i told marty and it 's kind of one of those mind things that it 's really hard to really get until you actually see it work and i said you know what i was going to do and he said so let me see if i can get this straight that doesn 't move and the thing without the wheels that moves precisely brings me to the next and final marty 's not going to see this is he this isn 't viewed outside of the next illustration is something that and that journey basically tells something about their personality in a very concise and what we wanted to do based on the shot in goodfellas which is one of the great shots ever he was the master of his of his universe and we wanted hugo to feel the same way so we created this shot that 's hugo music and his universe you know behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular and of course in shooting in 3d which is basically it 's a huge camera that 's hanging off of a giant so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the goodfellas shot so what you 're now going to see is how we actually did it it 's actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys the one on the left is where the shot ends and the shot on the right is where it and now we switch boys so it went from asa butterfield who 's the star of the show to his stand in i wouldn 't say his stunt double there 's a crazy rig that we built for this and so this is and now this is set number three we 're into and then we 're going to go into basically the very last moment of the shot is is actually the steadycam shot everything else was shot on cranes and various things and what was sort of great for me was it was probably the best reviewed shot i 've ever worked on and you know you should never really be proud of stuff i guess so i was kind of proud of it and i went to a friend of mine and what do you think was the reason and he said because no one knows you had anything to do with it thank you and that 's my presentation for"
