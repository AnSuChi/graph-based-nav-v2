  "transcript": "sustainability represents the what the where and the how of what is caught i want to know why they fish i want to know how they rely on the water 's bounty for their living understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we 're also so fortunate to eat so what do we call this i think we call it restorative seafood where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain it is a more hopeful it is a more human and is a more useful way of understanding our environment wallet guides standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world are very handy they 're a wonderful tool we can 't sustain this without the measure of our changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red but what if we eat only in the green list you 've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here but it 's a lion of the sea it 's a top predator what 's the context of this meal am i sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16 ounce portion of this do i do this three times a week i might still be in the green list but i 'm not doing myself or you or the oceans any favors the i 've heard that red wine is is great for my health well how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem we have lost this sensibility when it regards our food and we are paying a cost the problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves we are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines and we are hiding that cost behind monster profits so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs restorative seafood might best be represented not by jaws or by flipper or the gordon 's fisherman but rather by the jolly green giant sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green well i 'd like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue we must continue to eat the best seafood seafood possible if at all but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables the best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of tabasco and lemon wedges it comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with dijon mustard and crispy broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake whooo this is an easy sell and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every jamie oliver sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat there 's a pattern here forget nuclear holocaust it 's the fork that we have to worry about we have ravaged our earth and then used the food that we 've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one and so i think it 's time we change what we expect from our food sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand so let 's start there there 's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems dan barber and alice waters are leading passionately the green food delicious revolution but green foods often represent but we can never have any dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood while we try to manage declining marine populations the media 's recommending increased consumption of seafood studies say that tens of thousands of american grandmothers grandfathers mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we included more seafood that 's a reward i am not willing to pass up but it 's not all about the seafood it 's about the way that we look at our plates as a chef people started buying appetizers and salads because they knew they weren 't going to fill up on the entrees alone people spent more time engaging in their meals engaging with each other over their meals people got in short more of what i made more money this is great but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time one of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served small were directing tastes towards more resilience more restorative options but what of those big predators those fashionable species that well if you must i have a recipe for you it pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean so here we go start with a 16 ounce portion of big fish get a knife put it on four plates mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of burgundy you have light the candles and celebrate it celebrate the i expect that producing ingredients preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook and he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents i remember well i get sick it 's like a hangover from protein it 's disgusting but of all the dire news that you 'll hear and that you have heard about the state of oceans i have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time it 's pretty straightforward well for health i 'm looking for wholesome ingredients that that are good for my body i 'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories for community though we start at the very beginning there 's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step but it is more than just a repository it 's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner so if we all take only what we need then we can begin to share the rest we can begin to celebrate we can begin to restore we need to savor smaller portions of seafood and we need to save dinner thank you"
