  "transcript": "father daniel berrigan once said that writing about prisoners is a little like writing about the dead they 're unseen and unheard it 's easy to simply ignore them and it 's even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden as a journalist i think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching are precisely the stories that we need to tell that 's why i began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the united states for prisoners and guards call them little guantanamo floating within larger federal prisons neither of them underwent the formal review process that is required by law when they were opened i 'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner i 'm here because as supreme court justice thurgood marshall said when the prisons and gates slam shut prisoners do not lose their human quality every prisoner i 've interviewed has said there are three flecks of light in the darkness of prison phone calls letters and visits from family their phone calls can be limited to to the three hundred minutes other prisoners receive their letters can be limited to six pieces of paper their visits can be limited to four hours per month compared to the thirty five hours that people like olympic park bomber eric rudolph receive in the supermax on top of that cmu visits are except psychologically some small windows into the cmus have opened and they 're overwhelmingly muslim they include people like who violated the economic sanctions on iraq by sending medical supplies for the children there they 've included people like yassin aref aref and his family fled to new york from saddam hussein 's iraq as refugees he was arrested in two thousand and four as part of an fbi sting is an imam and he was asked to bear witness to a loan which is a tradition in islamic culture it turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist someone else in a fake attack aref didn 't know for that he was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist group meaning they help balance out the racial numbers in hopes of deflecting law suits these balancers include animal rights and environmental activists like daniel mcgowan mcgowan was convicted of participating in two arsons in the name of defending the environment as part of the earth liberation but that might be because the government hasn 't fully explained why some prisoners end up in a cmu and who is responsible for these decisions when mcgowan was transferred he was told it 's because a term the fbi uses repeatedly when talking about environmental activists and only a handful of them are in the cmus in mcgowan 's case he was previously at a low security prison so why was he moved like other cmu prisoners mcgowan repeatedly asked for an answer a hearing or some opportunity for an appeal this example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed wants a transfer told him no at but the warden was overruled by the bureau of counterterrorism unit working with the joint terrorism task force of the fbi later i found out that mcgowan was really sent to a cmu not because of what he did but what he has said a memo from the counterterrorism unit cited mcgowan 's beliefs while imprisoned he continued writing about environmental issues saying that activists must reflect on their mistakes and listen to each other in fairness if you 've spent any time at all in washington dc you know this is really a radical concept for the government i actually asked to visit mcgowan in the cmu and i was approved that came as quite a shock first because as i 've discussed on this stage before i i had even learned through the bureau of prisons counterterrorism unit so how could i possibly be approved to visit a few days before i went out to the prison i got an answer i was allowed to visit mcgowan as a friend not a journalist journalists are not allowed here mcgowan was told by cmu officials that if i asked any questions or published any story that he would be punished for my reporting and they said that if i to interview mcgowan the visit would be terminated the bureau of prisons describes cmus as but then the walk to the the rest of the prison is on lockdown so small my outstretched arms could touch each wall the unit insists that all the visits have to be in english for cmu prisoners which is an additional hardship for many of the muslim families bulletproof glass and on the other side was daniel mcgowan we spoke through these handsets attached to the wall and talked about books and movies we did our best to find reasons to laugh to fight boredom and amuse himself while in the cmu mcgowan had been spreading a rumor that i was secretly the president of a twilight fan club in washington dc i 'm not but i kind of the hope the fbi now thinks that bella and edward are terrorist code names during our visit mcgowan spoke most and at length about his niece lily his wife jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them to never be able to hold their hands i had published leaked cmu documents on my website and the counterterrorism unit said that mcgowan had called his wife and asked her to mail he wanted to see what the government was saying about him and for that he was sent back to the cmu when he was finally released at the end of his sentence his story got even more kafkaesque he wrote an article for the huffington post headlined court documents prove i was sent to a cmu for my political speech the next day he was thrown back in jail for his political speech according to the bureau of prisons they are for prisoners with now if you think that characterization is too strong just look at some of the government 's own documents when some of mcgowan 's mail was rejected by the the sender was told it 's because the letters were intended for political prisoners when another prisoner animal rights activist andy stepanian was sent to a cmu it was because of his but the unknown reality is that the us has a dark history of disproportionately punishing people in the before marion was home to the cmu it was home to the notorious control unit prisoners were locked down in solitary for twenty two hours a day the warden said the unit was to control revolutionary another experiment called the lexington high security unit held women connected to the weather underground black liberation and puerto rican independent struggles the prison radically restricted communication and used sleep deprivation and constant light for so called ideological conversion those prisons were eventually today civil rights lawyers with the center for constitutional rights are challenging cmus in court many of these documents would have never to light without this lawsuit the message of these groups and my message for you today their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls this story is not just about prisoners it is about us it is about our own commitment to human rights it is about whether we will choose to stop repeating the mistakes of our past thank you due process and about twenty five other laws and rights that seem to be violated by this how could this possibly be happening will potter i think that 's the number one question i get i think the solution to any of these types of situations any rights abuses one people don 't know what 's happening at all and then they 're already disenfranchised populations who don 't have access to attorneys not native english speakers in some of these cases they have great representation that i mentioned but there 's just not a public awareness of what 's happening tr isn 't it guaranteed in prison that you have right to council or access to council wp there 's a tendency in our culture to see when people have been convicted of a crime and i think that 's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have that allows as the general public just kind of turns a eye to it tr all those documents i 've actually uploaded all of them to my website cmu so you can see the documents for yourself without the little snippets you can see the full version i relied overwhelmingly on primary source documents or on primary interviews with former and current prisoners with people that are dealing with this situation every day and like i said i 've been there myself as well tr thank you"
