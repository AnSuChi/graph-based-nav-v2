  "transcript": "i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that 's tracked by architecture what 's interesting about architects is we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature and for roughly three hundred years the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture because the nose was one fifth of your head or because your head of your body 16th century and so a room would be dimensioned as one fourth of a facade the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as ten 15th century the decimal point was invented architects what 's going on and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form and it has a lot of implications the best example of this would probably be the gothic and the gothic was invented after the invention of calculus although the gothic architects weren 't really using cross you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines so you 're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form 19th century beginning of the 20th century and how that hanging chain model translates into archways and vaulting so in all of these examples structure is the determining force frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his mannheim concert hall interestingly in the last ten years norman foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the national gallery with the structural engineer chris williams and as an architect i 've always found these kinds of systems very limiting because i 'm not interested in ideal forms and i 'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment so what i thought i would and that 's basically the invention of generic form in genetic my hero is actually not darwin it 's a guy named william bateson father of greg bateson who was here for a long time and he was what you 'd call a teratologist he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules and laws rather than looking at the norms so instead of trying to find the ideal type instead of or you would get four fingers so the mutations reverted and bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking you revert back to symmetry so symmetry wasn 't the sign of order and organization which is what i was always understanding and as is an architect so whenever you lost information you 'd move to symmetry you added information to a system you would break symmetry so this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and literally after seeing that image and finding out what bateson was working with we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and the fact that means that we don 't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components so there might be up to say fifty thousand pieces of material in this room you 're sitting in right now that all need to get organized now typically you 'd think that they would all be the same like the chairs you 're sitting in would all be the same dimension you know i haven 't verified this but it 's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension because you 'd want to space them all out for everybody 's sight lines and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions that 's because we 're all using calculus tools for manufacturing and for design defined with calculus is a curve it 's just a curve without inflection etc it 's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature the intricacies of scale that come out of that you know in the example of the nose to the face there 's a fractional with calculus the whole idea of subdivision is more complex because the whole and the parts are one continuous series it 's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus so i brought some images to just describe how that works this and in this example you can see that the components of this but they 're repetitive without being modular each one of the elements in this structure is a unique distance and dimension and all of the connections are unique angles now the only way we could design that or possibly construct it is by using a definition of the form it also is much more dynamic so that you can see that the same opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it so the same space that appears to be a kind changes also in architecture light that comes from behind from an invisible source directionality that focuses you towards an altar it turns out it 's not rocket science to design a sacred space you just need to incorporate a certain these are the different perspectives of that interior which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form in terms of construction and manufacturing this is a housing block that was built in the ' 70s in i won 't go into too much description of any of these projects but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by one hundred and structural trusses because we 're using escalators to move people all of these trusses are picking up diagonal so every one of them is a little bit working with bentley and microstation we 've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these so it 's a single calculation for every single component of the building that we 're adding onto so it 's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components one to another and it 's because design firms that have connections to architects like i 'm working with vitra which is a furniture company and alessi which is a houseware company not to pick on bmw or to celebrate them but take bmw as an example they have to in two thousand and have a distinct identity for all their models of cars so the three hundred series or whatever their newest car is the one hundred series that 's coming out has to look like the seven hundred series at the other end of their product line so they need a distinct coherent identity which is bmw and that person paying more than double as manufacturing starts to allow more design options this problem gets exacerbated of the whole and the parts now as an architect part to whole relationships is all i think about but in terms of product design it 's becoming more and more of an issue the first kind of test product we did was with alessi which was for a coffee and tea set it 's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set we knew that at the beginning so i actually went to some people i knew down south in san diego and we used just cut a put it in an oven heat it to one thousand degrees we designed a system here of eight curves that could be swapped similar to that housing project i showed you and we could recombine those together so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way that and get incredible variation in the components this is one of those examples of the sets so for me what was important is that this coffee set which is just a coffee pot a teapot and those are the pots sitting on a tray that they would have a coherence so they would be greg lynn alessi coffee pots but that everyone who bought one would have a one of a kind object that was unique in some way to go back to architecture what 's organic about architecture as a field unlike product design is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm like we have to design things which are coherent as a single object but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale architects tend to work with signature and that problem of signatures is a thing we 're very good at maintaining and working with the shape of a building its structure its windows its color its pattern my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs i got in them because they 're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the let 's call it the decoration i know the frog doesn 't think of it as decoration but that 's how it works when doing so it 's all one continuous change in the massing but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms in a housing project in valencia spain we 're doing the but it breaks down but always within a kind of controlled limit an envelope of change i work with a group of other architects we have a company called united architects we were one of the finalists for the world trade center site design and i think this just shows how how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large scale construction we wanted to make a kind of gothic cathedral around the footprints of the world trade center site and to do that we tried to connect up and we looked there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing but this time in a much more monolithic mass like a sphere but again you can see this kind of organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole but breaks down into smaller parts but in an incredibly organic way"
