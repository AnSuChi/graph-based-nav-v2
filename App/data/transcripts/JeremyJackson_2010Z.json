  "transcript": "i started out in chesapeake bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight and somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet and that was what i did and i ended up in jamaica in the west indies where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary structurally that i ever saw in my life and this picture here it 's really interesting it shows things first of all it 's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far and film was so slow in the in that picture those reefs at we were the best and the brightest people came to study our reefs from australia which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs hurricane hurricane allen the wind blew very strong the waves were we 're real smart we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past and we published a paper in science the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by and the reason was because of overfishing and the fact that a last common grazer a sea urchin died and within a few months after that sea urchin dying the seaweed started to grow and that is the same reef the coral reefs of the north coast of jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime and that 's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the the coral reefs worldwide now that 's my little depressing story all of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable and it 's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well being because it just keeps getting worse and the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe a hurricane but what 's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that and so i 'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things we hear a lot about the collapse of cod it 's difficult to imagine that two or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod cod fed most of the people of western europe it fed the slaves brought to the antilles 80s and the thousand people lost their jobs and that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not so tasty from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world and what have you it 's a little hard to understand that because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish you ought to read the label to find out where it came from but it 's still cheap and everybody thinks it 's okay it 's hard to communicate this and one way that i think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish like to go out and catch fish it 's one of those things this picture here shows the trophy fish the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat throw a lot of hooks and lines into the well that 's what it 's like now but this is what it was like in the from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock the trophy fish were so big that you couldn 't put any of those small fish up on it and if you wanted to go out and kill something you could pretty much count on being able and people paid less in one thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those those little tiny fish it 's not just the fish though that are disappearing we use nets that are twenty miles long we use that have one million or two million hooks and we trawl which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds put it on a big chain and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest because it it clears it away and the habitat destruction is unbelievable this is a photograph a typical photograph of what the continental shelves of the world look like you can see the rows in the bottom the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed which is a critical habitat for the development of fish what it is now the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud to parking lot is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all but what 's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems and i 'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients it 's a bit of an embarrassment it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco it was bred to be cold tolerant it 's very pretty and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern mediterranean i don 't know how many of you remember the movie the little shop of horrors but this is the plant of the little shop of horrors but instead of devouring the people in the shop what it 's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom dwelling life of the entire northwestern mediterranean sea we don 't know anything that eats it we 're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done but as it stands it 's the monster from hell it 's subsidized which is one of the reasons we used too much of it it runs down the rivers and it feeds the plankton the little microscopic plant cells so it dies of old age which is unheard of for plankton and when it dies it falls to the bottom and then which means that bacteria break it down and in the process they use up all the oxygen and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can 't swim what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish as you see on the left even in newfoundland where we used to catch cod we now have a jellyfish fishery toxic blooms that picture on the left is just staggering to me i have talked about it a million times but it 's unbelievable in the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the mississippi delta and the lower left of that picture is the border you 're looking at the entire northwestern gulf of mexico you 're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish made by that 's the same species and that 's retirement homes on the west coast of florida a friend and i did this thing in hollywood we called hollywood ocean night and i was trying to figure out how to explain to actors and the only people who are left there are the people who can 't afford to move away from the coast because the coast instead of being paradise is harmful to your health which is being enveloped in this green the reason that it attracted so much attention and a farmer died of it and you can imagine the scandal that happened and so there 's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all and the net result is that the beaches of brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis and then of course there 's climate change and we all know about climate change i guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the arctic sea think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the northwest passage well the northwest passage is already there i think it 's sort of funny it 's on the siberian coast maybe the russians will charge tolls the cia and the navies of norway and and the u s and canada whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view the other kinds of effects of climate change this is coral bleaching it 's a beautiful picture right all that white coral except it 's supposed to be brown what happens is that the corals are a symbiosis and they have these little algal cells that live inside them and the algae give the corals sugar and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection but when it gets too hot the algae can 't make the sugar the corals say you cheated you didn 't pay your rent they kick them out and then they die not all of them die some of them survive some more are surviving but it 's really bad news to try and give you a sense of this imagine you go camping in july somewhere in europe or in north america and you wake up the next and you come home and you discover that eighty percent of all the trees in north america and in europe have dropped their leaves and then you read in the paper a few weeks later oh by the way a quarter that 's what happened in the indian ocean during the one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight el nino an area vastly greater than the size of north america and europe when eighty percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them and then the really scary thing about all of this the overfishing the pollution and the climate change but there are these what we call positive feedbacks the and the great scientific challenge but what does that mean what are the oceans well there won 't be any fish except for minnows and the water will be pretty dirty and all those kinds of things and full of mercury etc etc and dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they 'll start to merge and we can imagine something sometimes you don 't that doesn 't sell the really scary things though are the physical chemical oceanographic things that are happening as the surface of the ocean gets warmer the water is lighter when it 's warmer it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over we say it becomes more strongly stratified the consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta water from the surface which is rich in oxygen doesn 't make it down and and the ocean turns into a desert so the question is how are we all going to respond we can do all sorts of things to fix it this or not i would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that"
