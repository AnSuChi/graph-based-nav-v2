  "transcript": "ten years ago i went through a little bit of a hard time so i decided to go see a therapist i had been seeing her for a few months when she looked at me one day and said who actually raised you until you were three i don 't think that 's actually the case because if it were we 'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this it and whenever i tried to make a joke she would look at me and say that is actually really sad and to my surprise they said i remember my auntie so i remember the thick straight hair and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up the way i would cling to her even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat i loved her but [ with ] the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love i remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop as i did every single time it happened for things as minor as wanting to go out with her i became so hysterical over her treatment that eventually she was just beaten behind closed doors as an adult i learned later that she had been just nineteen when she was brought over from thailand to the states to care for me on a tourist visa because i was afraid if i said everything that she meant to me that i owed perhaps the best parts of who i became to her care and that the words i 'm sorry were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage i felt over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had i thought if i said those words to her i would never stop crying again and even so i never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty and when i think about what we 've done about human trafficking partly because we don 't even talk about the problem right at all when i say human trafficking most of you probably don 't think about someone like my auntie and that is a real story that story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation as a journalist i really care about how we relate to each other through language and the way we tell that story with all the gory violent detail the salacious aspects i call that look at her scars journalism we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl that story lets us off the hook when in reality human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives let me show you what i mean forced prostitution accounts for ten percent is in state imposed forced labor but a whopping sixty eight percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day that is food and care and shelter and somehow these most essential fraud or coercion to compel another person 's labor and coltan mines and even car washes in norway and england it 's found in u s military bases in iraq and afghanistan it 's found in thailand 's fishing industry but what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp thai military were caught selling burmese and cambodian migrants onto fishing boats those fishing boats were taken out the men put to work and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick or tesco walmart and carrefour human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that and in places you would never even imagine traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks to sing in touring boys ' choirs the traffickers found and they told these families that your daughters are going to get a fine education in the united and they told them we 'll help you out we 'll get you a plane ticket we 'll pay your fees seven days a week for five years they made their traffickers nearly four million dollars this is a huge problem so what have we done about it we 've mostly turned to the criminal justice system and for populations like criminal justice system is too often part of the problem rather than the solution between twenty and sixty percent of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone people in prostitution including people who have been trafficked into it regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution leave abuse or leave prostitution if that person so desires they risk deportation in case after case i 've studied employers have no problem calling on law enforcement to try and threaten or deport their striking trafficked workers they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they 're caught law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers but out of an estimated twenty one million victims of human trafficking in the world they have helped and identified fewer than fifty thousand people that 's like comparing the population of the world to the population of los angeles proportionally speaking as for convictions out of an estimated five thousand seven hundred convictions in two thousand and thirteen fewer than five hundred were for labor trafficking keep in mind that labor trafficking accounts for sixty eight percent of all trafficking but fewer than ten percent of the convictions i 've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed i 'd like to add one more element to that trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections and denied the right to organize trafficking doesn 't happen in a vacuum it happens in systematically degraded work environments let me tell you what that looks like i spent many months researching a trafficking case called global they were promised three years of solid agricultural work they were brought over this case hit me so hard i was remembering the over the top meals the global horizons survivors would make for me every time i showed up to interview them finished one meal with this plate of perfect long stemmed strawberries and as they handed them to me they said and don 't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you i realized i had no idea of who to thank for this plenty and no idea of how they were being treated and i found there are too many fields and too few labor inspectors i found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor god knows who else the global horizons survivors had been brought to the states on a temporary guest worker program mind you none of what i am describing about this agricultural sector or the guest worker program is actually and i would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation and all of this had been hidden to me before i had tried to understand it founder of ebay is one of the biggest anti trafficking philanthropists even he wound up accidentally investing nearly ten million dollars in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions in that global horizons case and they wound up writing an op ed for a newspaper saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support totally agree what would happen if each one of us decided that we are no longer going to support companies if they don 't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains if all the ceos out there decided that they were going to go through their buying a guilt free zone with your money that 's not how it works and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long but that is not my experience of them over all the years that i 've been talking to them they have taught me that we are more than our worst days each one of us is more than what we have lived through especially trafficking survivors they were the emissaries of hope the nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers ' families their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers the nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade they came together and they decided that they were going to make the world 's first anti trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves these indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post hurricane katrina reconstruction they were threatened with deportation but they broke out of their work compound and they marched from new orleans to washington d c to protest labor they have wound up helping other workers and although the department of justice declined to take their case a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits this february and got their clients fourteen million dollars and for the possibility of a just world for all of us that our prosperity i was so reluctant before i started this ted process and climbed up on this stage told literally a handful of people about it i don 't know her story of what happened and of her life now we are all implicated in this problem figuring out to build a more just world is our work to do and our story to tell thank you so much"
