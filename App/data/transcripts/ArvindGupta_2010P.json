  "transcript": "it was a very revolutionary time it was a political ferment so to say students out in the streets of paris revolting against authority america was jolted by the the civil rights movement in india we had the the [ unclear ] movement but you know when there is a political churning of society it unleashes a lot of energy the national movement of india was testimony to that lots of people resigned from one of the great programs in india was to revitalize primary science in village schools there was a person anil sadgopal did a ph d from caltech the he was not able to relate the kind of [ unclear ] research which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people so he designed and went and started a village science program the slogan of the early ' 70s was go to the people start from what they know build on what they have this was kind of the defining slogan pretty close to pune i worked there for two years and i and i went to this village science program it was a very small village a weekly bazaar where people just so i said i 'm going to spend a year over here so i just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside this is called well you make a triangle with four you make a square you make a pentagon you can just pull this out this becomes a rectangle you give it a push this becomes a parallelogram pull this out it becomes a boat shape trapezium he can 't do a thing to it ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in india not have gone to engineering college but no one makes a roof placed like this because if they put tiles on top now this is people science and if you were to just poke and if i were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices put this on top you can make a joint of four you can make a joint of six you just need a ton now this was you make a joint of six you make an put four marbles inside you simulate the molecular structure of methane well since then i just thought that i 've been really privileged to ivy league schools i 've been invited by most of them and i see happiness in their faces children want to make things children want to do things and we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it so all you do is it 's a very kind of provocative statement this old bicycle tube and this filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube and this is how you make a valve you put a little sticky tape this is one way traffic and you and this is the pump and it 's like a great great sprinkler it 's like a centrifuge if you spin something it tends to fly out if it tends to fly out if i do it with both hands you can see this fun mr flying man this is a toy which eagles here 's a paper which you could [ unclear ] designed by documented by martin gardner in many of his many books but this is great fun for children and this can be if you had a whole photocopy paper a4 size paper you could be in a municipal school you could be in a government school a paper a scale and a pencil no glue no scissors in three minutes you just fold this up if you take a smaller paper you make a smaller flexagon now this is a and this is a hundred year old toy there have been six major research papers on this something very amazing happens six major research papers on and you don 't need the three billion dollar hadron collider for doing this applause this is there for every child and every child can enjoy this if you want to put and this is what newton newton talked about four hundred years back that white light 's made of seven colors just by spinning this around this is a kind of a blowing straw i just put this inside this there 's and i shut this and this costs very little money to make great fun for children to do now this is the simplest motor on earth if you have a battery it costs five cents to make it this is an old bicycle tube which gives you a broad rubber band two safety pins this is a permanent whenever current flows through the coil this becomes an electromagnet it 's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin we when teachers make it children make it you can see a gleam in their eye and this science is not a rich man 's game in a democratic country must reach to our most oppressed to the most marginalized children this program started with sixteen schools and spread to one thousand five hundred government schools look this is the tetrapak awful materials from the point of view of the so something which is trash which is choking all the seabirds this is and what you do is you just nip two corners here and this becomes like a baby crocodile 's mouth you put this in your mouth and you blow i 'm going to keep this and you keep cutting it and something very very nice happens what the kids teach you you can also do this and this is my drawing pen it 's basically like a like a and this is wool over here if i crank the handle all the wool goes inside and there are twelve million blind children come as a great boon to them not able to provide them with food not able to provide them with vitamin a anyone can make it this is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between and this fiber turns a wire attached to an led if i spin this pulley the small one 's going to spin much faster there will be a spinning magnetic field well they just keep going on and imagine a bunch of kids standing in a in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on and they 'd be absolutely joyous playing with this well in the end what we can also do we use a lot of old newspapers to make this is worthy of sachin tendulkar it 's a great cricket cap when first and this is you can see this is and you can see this is a little this is called the captain 's hat story the captain was a captain of a the first day it was a huge umbrella cap like a captain 's cap because it protects the spinal cord and the third day it would be a shikari cap just like an adventurer 's cap this is what the policeman wears it 's called a zapalu cap so that 's a ship and now the end everyone was enjoying the journey very much they were singing and dancing suddenly there was a storm and another and the captain has lost everything but for a life jacket"
