  "transcript": "talk about the two ideas that at least based on my observations at khan academy are kind of the core or the key leverage points for for learning and it 's the idea of mastery and the idea i saw this in the early days working with my cousins a lot of them were having trouble with math at first because they had all of these gaps accumulated in their in their learning and because of that at some point they got to an algebra class and they might have been a little bit shaky on some of the pre algebra and because of that and at first those comments were just simple thank yous i thought that was a pretty big deal i don 't know how much time you all spend on youtube most of the comments are not thank you they 're a little edgier than that but then the comments got a little more intense student after student saying that they had grown up not liking math was getting difficult as they got into more advanced math topics by the time they got to algebra they had so many gaps in their knowledge they couldn 't engage with it but when they were a bit older they took a little agency and decided to engage they found resources like khan academy and they were able to fill in those gaps and that reinforced their mindset that it wasn 't fixed that they actually were capable of of learning mathematics you would practice the white belt skills as long you practice the basic piece over and over again and only when you 've mastered it you go on to the more advanced one but what we point out this is not the way a a traditional academic model is structured the type of academic model that most of us grew up in in a traditional academic model we group students together usually by age and around middle school by age and perceived ability the teacher will give a lecture on exponents and then we get a test and even though the test identified gaps in our knowledge i didn 't the whole class will then move on to the next subject probably a a more advanced subject that 's going to build on those gaps it might be logarithms or negative exponents and that process continues and you immediately start to realize how how and now i 'm being pushed to the more advanced thing this will continue for months years all the way until at some point i might be in an algebra class or trigonometry class and i hit a wall and it 's not because algebra is fundamentally difficult or because the student isn 't bright it 's because i 'm seeing an equation and they 're dealing with exponents and that thirty percent that i didn 't know is showing up and then i start to disengage to how absurd that is imagine if we did other things in our life that way say home building so we bring in the contractor and say we were told we have two weeks to build a foundation do what you can laughter so they do what they can maybe it rains maybe some of the supplies don 't show up and two weeks later the inspector comes around says ok the concrete is still wet right over there that part 's not quite up to code i 'll give it an eighty percent you say great that 's a c let 's build the first floor but what was really broken was the process we were artificially constraining how long we had to something pretty much ensuring a variable outcome so the idea of mastery learning is to do the exact opposite instead of artificially constraining fixing when and how long you work on something pretty much ensuring that variable outcome the a b c d f and it 's important to realize that not only will this make the student learn their exponents better the right mindset muscles it makes them realize that if you got twenty percent wrong on something it doesn 't mean that you have a c branded in your dna somehow now a lot of skeptics might say well hey this is all great philosophically this whole idea of mastery based learning and its connection to mindset students taking agency over their learning makes a lot of sense but it seems impractical to actually do it every student would be on their own track it would have to be personalized you 'd have to have private tutors where they did mastery based learning they need they can go into simulations socratic dialogue to appreciate what we 're talking about and the the tragedy of of lost potential here i 'd like to give a little bit of a a thought experiment if we were to go four hundred years into the past to western europe which even then was one of the more literate parts of of the planet and i suspect that if you asked someone who did know how to read say a member of the clergy what percentage of the population do you think is even capable of reading maybe twenty or thirty percent but if i were to ask you a similar question what percentage of the population do you think is capable of truly mastering calculus or understanding organic maybe twenty thirty percent but what if that estimate is just based on your own experience in a non mastery framework your own experience with yourself or observing your peers where you 're being pushed at this set pace through classes accumulating all these gaps even when you got that ninety five percent what was that five percent you missed and it keeps accumulating you get to an advanced class all of a sudden you hit a wall and say i 'm not meant to be a cancer researcher not meant to be a physicist not meant to be a mathematician i suspect that that actually is the case but if you were allowed to be operating in a mastery framework if you were allowed to really take agency over your learning and when you get something wrong embrace it view that failure as a moment of learning that number and this isn 't even just a nice to have i think it 's a social imperative we 're exiting what you could call the industrial age and we 're going into this at the base of the pyramid you needed human labor but we know what 's happening already as we go into this information revolution the bottom of that pyramid information processing that 's what computers are good at so as a society we have a question all this new productivity is happening because of this technology but who participates in it is it just going to be that very top of the pyramid in which case what does everyone else do how do they operate or do we do something that 's more aspirational where you have a large creative class i really think that this is all based on the idea that if we let people tap into their potential by being able to exercise agency over their learning that they can get there and when you think of it as just a a citizen of the world it 's pretty exciting think about the type of equity we can we have and the rate at which civilization could even progress thank you"
