  "transcript": "get invited to give weird talks but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys shortly after that i got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals and again i couldn 't go but it 's a fascinating group they make balloon animals there is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals but really cool stuff with balloons sometimes they get in trouble what exactly to the people watching this do every day and i want to argue that what we do is we try to change everything that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that is first about a guy named nathan winograd nathan was the number two person at the san francisco spca and what you may not know about the history of the spca is it was founded to kill dogs and cats cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them in a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed most of them within twenty four hours of being scooped off of the street nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it so they set out to make san francisco a no kill city unless it was and everyone said it was impossible and people from spcas and humane shelters around the country flew to san francisco to testify against them and within just a couple years san francisco became the first running no deficit completely supported by the community he went from being a glorified and i think about the idea that i don 't know if you 've ever been to a jewish wedding but what they do is they take a light bulb and they smash it now there is a bunch of reasons for that and stories about it but one reason is because it indicates a change and i want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented we started with the factory idea that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change we then went to the tv idea that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece if you could get on tv enough times if you could buy enough ads you could win and now we 're in this new model of leadership it enables him to hire because he 's got an efficient enough factory well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars you can make a lot of change you can get roads built you can change the fabric of an entire country that the essence of what you 're doing is you need ever cheaper labor and the problem we 've run into is we 're running out of both ever cheaper labor and so and if i can just get enough money to tell enough but be careful because you don 't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition where you 're talking about one thing instead of the other you to act like the king and you 're going to tell people what to do next the hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate unfortunately it doesn 't work so well anymore either but there is good news around the corner really good news i call it the idea of tribes having a work tribe thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world you 've got because you want to be connected that people on the fringes can find each other connect and go somewhere every town that has a volunteer fire it turns out this is a legitimate non photoshopped photo people i know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop and it turns out that it 's tribes that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not because you force them he didn 't do it by thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can 't be in one hundred or two hundred or five hundred cities in each night i don 't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next i don 't have what it takes to be that kind of leader they 're about the same age that 's about it what would happen if when you 're using your kindle you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen and use it to organize people who want to talk about something most leadership that we 're doing is about finding a group that 's disconnected but already has a yearning not persuading people to want something they don 't have yet when diane hatz she didn 't invent the idea but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement hugo chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of venezuela he merely led them bob marley did not invent rastafarians he just stepped up and said follow me derek sivers what all these people have in common is that they are heretics that heretics look at the status quo and say this will not i don 't like it that instead of being what i call a sheepwalker somebody who fitting in every once in a while someone stands up and says not me someone stands up and says this one is important but you don 't need everyone you just need a few people who will look at the rules realize they make no sense zappos is the one the only the place for people who are into shoes to find each other it can be something as prosaic but if i can get other people to join my climb and ride then together we can get something that we all she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other by leading a movement and the third one because focusing on that part of it not the mechanics of what you 're building but the who and the leading part is where change comes so blake at tom 's shoes had a very simple idea what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn 't even own a pair it 's a story of a product that tells a story and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says what are those you get to tell the story on blake 's behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes and suddenly it 's not one pair of shoes or one hundred pairs of shoes it 's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes my friend red maxwell has spent the last ten years fighting against juvenile diabetes not fighting the organization that 's fighting it and the people he surrounds himself with it makes a difference you don 't need permission from people to lead them but in case you do here it is they 're waiting we 're waiting for you to show us so here is what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge the second thing is they build a culture curiosity they want to be missed and tribe leaders can do that it 's fascinating because but you don 't need charisma to become a leader being a leader gives they commit to the cause they commit to the tribe they commit to the people who are there"
