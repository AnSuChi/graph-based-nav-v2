  "transcript": "this is actually a painting that hangs at the countway library at harvard medical school and it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted in the front you see actually joe murray getting the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room you see hartwell harrison the chief of urology at harvard actually harvesting the kidney the kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human that was back in years ago but we have a major shortage of organs while at the same time the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat but as we age our organs tend to fail more so that 's a challenge not trying to replace nerves that can help us with parkinson 's these are major issues this is actually a very stunning statistic every thirty seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement what can we do about it we 've talked about stem cells tonight wouldn 't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies to actually heal ourselves this is actually a limb injury in this and that scar actually grows out a new limb why can 't humans regenerate actually we can regenerate your body has many organs and every single organ in your body body has a cell population that 's ready to take over at the time of injury it the challenge occurs when there is an injury at the time of injury or disease the body 's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body and seal itself whether it 's organs inside your body or your skin the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in to seal itself off from the outside so how can we harness that power one of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials we basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a and you close off and cells that regenerate in your body can then this was an injured and then six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered the maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter so we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps so we do regenerate but for limited distances what do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter less than half the size of a postage stamp you can then tease that tissue apart and look at its basic components the patient 's own cells but actually these materials are fairly it disintegrates a few months later it 's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle it 's bringing the cells into the body it 's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue and we then place we actually exercise it we want to make sure that we condition this muscle so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient that 's what you 're seeing here you 're seeing this muscle actually exercising the muscle back and these are flat structures that we see here the muscle this is actually an engineered blood vessel and what we you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside you now have your fully seeded scaffold it has the same conditions as a human body thirty seven degrees centigrade functional blood vessel more complex structures such as blood vessels urethras which i showed but they are really acting mostly as conduits you 're allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states the bladder is one we then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components muscle and these we then take a scaffold that we shape like we place it back six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient when we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient we brought patients in six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery did x rays and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient 's size pelvic cavity for the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes small medium large and extra large and i 'm sure everyone here wanted an extra large right we exercise these prior to implantation same strategy once it 's coated it gets placed there and this is actually digits that we 're engineering these are being layered one layer at a time first the bone we fill in the gaps fairly more complex organs but by far the most complex a lot of blood vessel supply organs such as the heart we use you just saw an inkjet cartridge this is actually your typical desktop printer it 's actually printing this applause this technology was developed by tao ju who worked at our institute and this is actually still of course experimental not for use in patients and we by using these mild detergents we take all the cells out of the liver two weeks later all made up of collagen a material that 's in our bodies that will not reject we can use it from one patient to the next we then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply you can see actually that 's a fluoroscopy the organ and we can then create functional livers and that 's actually what you 're seeing this but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure experimentally and and that is something we 're working on right now at the institute that i wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we 're going for in regenerative medicine we are limited with distances right now but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time if we cannot use smart biomaterials then we 'd rather use your very own because they will not reject we can take cells from you create the structure put it right back into you they will not reject and if possible we 'd rather use the cells from your very specific if you present with a diseased wind pipe we 'd like to take cells from your windpipe if you present with a diseased we don 't need to teach it to become another cell type so we prefer organ specific cells and today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body except for several which we still that will not reject i do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have you know i just showed you this presentation everything looks so good everything works so these are very the bottom is usually the surgeons i 'm a surgeon so that 's not that funny but actually method a is the correct approach and what i mean by that is that anytime we 've launched one of these technologies to the clinic and when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question and then we proceed because our main goal of course is first to do no harm i 'm going to show you now we started implanting some of these structures over fourteen years ago she had a spina bifida defect a spinal cord abnormality she did not have a normal bladder this is a segment from cnn five seconds this is a segment that sanjay gupta actually took care of"
