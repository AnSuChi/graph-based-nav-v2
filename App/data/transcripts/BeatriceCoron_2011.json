  "transcript": "so my process is very straightforward i visualize my story so i didn 't come to papercutting in a straight line i was not born with a blade and i don 't remember papercutting as a child and i left everything and went for a long series of i have been a shepherdess a truck driver i worked in tourism for one year in mexico and then i settled in new york and i still worked as a tour leader and i decided it 's time to start as an artist and i chose the language of silhouette so the word silhouette comes from a minister of finance etienne de silhouette and he slashed so many budgets and they needed to have their portrait and people told me like these thirty six views of the empire state building they told me you 're making artist books but to me they are fascinating objects to so i 'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in so as you can guess my mother tongue is french so one of these works is the spelling spider so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee bee but it 's much more connected to the web and so you can read and one ancient form of the book is scrolls because you can create a large image so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image so it 's to look beyond the surface it 's to have a look at different worlds and very often i 've been an outsider so so each window is an image and is a world and i revisit this world thinking about the image about what we want to do and what are the so what if so sometimes i view from the inside like egocentricity and the inner circles and my everything i see i have some stories that are humorous of sugar and sometimes i have an emotional response to news such as the two thousand and ten haitian earthquake other times it 's not even my stories i cannot speak for all my images so just go through a few of my worlds just with the title and at one point i had to do the whole nine yards so it 's actually a papercut that 's nine yards long everything is connected one story leads to another i was also interested in the physicality of this format because you have to walk to see it i started with small then i went to papercutting marathon at the museum of arts and design in new york city they were installed in the museum on two floors there is no border in between some people are born in hells other people make the opposite trip and then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we so the whole hells and heavens is about free will and in papercutting you have the drawing as the structure itself here it 's an artist book installation called identity project so it 's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity that 's another artist book project in fact in the picture you have two of them why do i call it a book it 's called fashion statement and there are quotes about fashion so you can and they are just randomly moved by the wind and i entered competitions for a long time it was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen i made an artist book i called it working in the same direction but i added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions i could also make cut glass here it 's faceted glass in the bronx and each time i make public art i want something that 's really relevant to the place it 's installed so for the subway in new york i saw it is travel in time travel on time and bronx literature it 's all about bronx writers and their stories so i started in the center with the acorn and then the fruit of the world etched and printed glass into architectural glass i took in their title and on the branches you have library material because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs another functional work it 's in the south and it 's called seeds of the future are planted today and not to have objects falling on the rails to be able to change fences and window guards and sometimes it 's about a legacy of the neighborhood like in morrisania about the jazz and for other projects like in paris it 's about the name of the street it 's called rue des prairies so i brought back the rabbit the dragonfly i was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in new york city for a year i created all around town so i can call it they have a lot of scenarios and everybody 's a narrator because everybody has a story to tell but more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world but the destination is our minds and it 's what story cutting is all about"
