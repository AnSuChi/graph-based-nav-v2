  "transcript": "a part of a crew of astronauts traveling to mars or some distant planet the travel time could take a year or even longer the space on board and the resources would so you and the crew would have to figure out how to produce food with minimal inputs and what if those crops would then make more seeds enabling you to feed the entire crew with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip the scientists at nasa actually figured out a way to do this and they also used hydrogen from water the types of microbes that they a virtuous carbon cycle that would sustain life onboard a spacecraft astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutritious carbon rich crop the astronauts would then eat which then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide by the astronauts so why is this important and we get our carbon from food on a long space journey you simply wouldn 't be able to pick up any carbon along the way so you 'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board but the thing is that research didn 't really go anywhere we haven 't yet gone to mars we haven 't yet gone to another planet and this was actually done in the ' 60s and ' 70s so a colleague of mine dr john reed and and we discovered this research by reading some papers published in the and later we have limited space and limited resources and on earth we really do need to figure out so we had the idea can we take some of these nasa type ideas and apply them to our carbon problem here on earth could we cultivate these nasa type microbes in order to make valuable products here on earth we started a company to do it and in that company we discovered that these which i 'll actually call nature 's supercharged carbon recyclers we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely overlooked and that they could make some really valuable products so we began cultivating these products these microbes in our lab we found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide using these microbes and we even made a protein rich meal that has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find in some animal proteins and we found that we can make oil which can be used for flavoring and for and we made an oil that 's similar to palm oil palm oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial goods we began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology and we 're currently working with them to bring some of these products to market we believe this type of technology can indeed help us profitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products something that 's beneficial for the planet but also beneficial for business this type of technology and using these types of microbes actually could help us do something even greater if we take it to the next level we believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that 's sustainable well actually it is estimated that the population will reach about ten billion by two 're projecting that we will need to increase food production by seventy percent so how will we scale to meet that demand well modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand are a number of reasons why one of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases we have cleared nineteen point four million square miles for crops and livestock what does that look like well that 's roughly the size of south america and africa combined let me give you a specific example in indonesia an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately between two thousand and two thousand and twelve just think of all of the species whether plant life insects or animal life and a natural carbon sink was also removed so let me make this real for you and as i mentioned before palm oil is used to manufacture many products in fact it is estimated that over fifty percent of consumer products cookies lotions soaps you and i both probably have numerous items so you and i are direct beneficiaries and we need solutions if we want to scale sustainably i believe that microbes can be a part of the answer specifically these supercharged carbon recyclers and they thrive in exotic places on earth like hydrothermal vents and hot springs minerals and carbohydrates and actually microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives if you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a friday night after a long hard work week or but the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours versus months that means we can make crops much faster they can grow in containers that require minimal space and as a result produce much more product per area if we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers because at a large scale you can actually make ten thousand times more output per land area than you could for instance if you used soybeans if you planted soybeans on that same area of land over a period of a year ten thousand so this is what i mean by a new type of agriculture and this is what i mean by developing a system that allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of ten billion and what would be the products of this new type so you can imagine something similar to cakes nutritional items of many sorts is used to manufacture etc using these types of crops not only are we running out of space we run the risk of robbing our progeny we can imagine a future of abundance let us create systems that keep not only from not crashing but let us also develop systems and ways of living that will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves thank you very much"
