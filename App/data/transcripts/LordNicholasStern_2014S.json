  "transcript": "we face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations let me illustrate with an example i first visited beijing twenty five years ago to teach at the people 's university of china china was getting serious about market economics and about university education so they decided to call in the like most other people i moved around beijing from dodging the occasional vehicle it was a safe and easy way to get around cycling in beijing now is a completely different prospect the roads are jammed by cars and trucks the air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal when i was there last in the spring there was an advisory for people of my age to stay indoors and not move much how did this come about it came from it 's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel dirty energy particularly coal china burns half and that 's why it is a key reason why it is the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases we have to recognize that in that period china has grown remarkably hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty that 's really the same time the people of china are asking the question what 's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development it 's looking to build its cities in different ways now the growth of china is part of a dramatic change fundamental change in the structure of the world economy the developing countries the poorer countries of the world were now it 's more than half twenty five years from now it will probably be two thirds from rich or poor are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that i want to talk about and highlight now the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that i 've already begun to illustrate through the percent now in urban areas that 's going to go to seventy percent in two thousand and fifty over the next two decades we 'll see the demand for energy rise by forty percent and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land on our water and on our forests structural change if we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods the people around the world would be poor and damaged and more than that the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise with immense risks to our climate concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already if we go on increasing those we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years we 've been around as homo sapiens that 's a rather generous definition sapiens we risk temperatures we haven 't seen for tens of millions of years over a century that would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet it would lead to changing rivers changing patterns of hurricanes changing sea levels hundreds of millions of people and we couldn 't just turn it you can 't make a peace treaty with the planet you can 't negotiate with the laws of physics you 're in there you 're stuck the climate we have to decide whether to do it well or badly the economic or structural transformation but the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do those two transformations face us in the next two decades the next two decades are decisive for what we have to do the more i 've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity it 's an opportunity which we can use energy and land and let me start with cities congestion waste and so on surely we recognize that like life but particularly and many big ones we have to think of how to design them in a compact way the cities that already are there well established examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that the bus rapid transport system in bogot in colombia is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non polluting way in a city very frequent buses strongly protected routes the same service really as an take my hometown london in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two smog in london killed four thousand people and badly damaged the lives of many many more and that 's the way london was by regulating coal within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly when the visibility dropped to [ less ] than a few meters they stopped the buses and i had to walk but it was changed it was changed by a decision and cleaned up you can see that the two transformations i 've described the structural and the climate and if we do we 'll see and stronger community in those cities public transport recycling reusing all sorts of things that bring communities we can do that but we have to think we have to invest we have to plan let me turn to energy perhaps it will increase by another forty percent or so we have to use it much more efficiently and we have to make it clean we can see how to do that take the example of california it would be in the top ten countries in the world if it was independent around twenty percent in renewables wind solar and so on to over thirty three percent and that would bring california back to greenhouse gas emissions that 's a striking achievement it shows what can be done not just california the incoming government of india is planning to get i think they 've got a good chance of doing that we 'll see but what you 're seeing now is people moving much more quickly four hundred million more than the population of the united states those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms of rapidity of again you can see and those two transformations the economy and the structure and the climate and the low carbon are intimately intertwined do the first one well the structural the second one on the climate becomes look at land land and particularly forests forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species they hold water in the soil but we 're losing we 've lost a forest area the size of portugal and much more has been degraded but we 're already seeing that we can do so much about that we can recognize the problem but we can also understand how to tackle it in brazil the rate of deforestation has been reduced by seventy percent how by involving local communities investing in their agriculture and their economies by monitoring more carefully by enforcing the law more strictly and it 's not just stopping deforestation that 's of course of first and fundamental importance i first went to ethiopia in it was desperately actually more than a few ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly it has ambitions to be a middle income country fifteen years from now again i think you 're seeing that commitment there you 're seeing what can be done ethiopia is investing in clean energy it working in the rehabilitation of land in humbo in southwest ethiopia a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest management has led to big increases in living standards so we can see from california to india from brazil to ethiopia we do understand i don 't have to list all those things to an audience like this but you can see the electric cars you can see the batteries using new materials you can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our mobile phones when we 're away you can see better insulation and there 's much more coming but and it 's a big but the world as a whole is moving far too slowly we 're not cutting emissions in the way we should we 're not managing those structural transformations the depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change we need political pressure we need leaders to step up we can have better growth better climate a better world we can make by managing those two transformations well the next one hundred years if we make a mess of it we you and me if we make a mess of it if we don 't manage those transformations properly it will be the next one hundred years will be the worst that 's the major conclusion of the report on the economy and climate ex president felipe caldern and we handed that report yesterday here in new york in the united nations building to the secretary general of the we know that we can do this here are two weeks old are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and still we failed to act let 's make the next one hundred years the best of centuries"
