  "transcript": "it 's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don 't see and they say how can i understand those invisible forces and i say empathy start put yourself into the shoes of another person here i 'll give you an example so i imagine my life and they found it in fact they found lots of it right here and pretty soon they began shipping that coal ton by ton railcar by railcar boatload by boatload back to china and elsewhere around the world and they got fabulously wealthy in doing so and they built beautiful cities all powered and back here we saw economic despair deprivation this is what i saw i saw people struggling to get by how is it possible that we could be so poor here in the united states because coal is such a wealthy resource so much money and i realize because the chinese and the chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure that people like me would not speak out against this relationship and they did things like train americans to help protect the coal and back in china what do they say in china nothing and i get pissed as do lots of average people and we fight back and it gets really ugly and the chinese respond in a very ugly way and lots of people are dying can you imagine what you would feel or a truck full of soldiers just imagine what you would feel because you know you know what they 're doing here and you just feel the anger and you feel the fear you 've left your shoes and you 've stood in mine and ok so that 's the warm up that 's the warm up now we 're going to have so for the remainder of my talk what i want you to do is put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary arab muslim living in the middle east in particular in iraq and so to help you perhaps you 're a member of this middle class family in baghdad you read the newspaper you go down to the coffee shop with your friends you read the newspapers from around the world sometimes but really you just want a better life for yourself that 's what you want you 're arab muslim number one this incursion into your land these past twenty years and before the reason anyone is interested in your land and particularly the united states is oil you know that everybody knows that people back in the united states know it 's about oil it 's because somebody else has a design for your resource it 's your resource it 's not somebody else 's it 's your land because they have an entire economic system that 's dependent on that oil and what else do you think about these people they 're happy you think that it 's not true of course but that 's the media impression and that 's what you get struggle i mean this is iraq you see people not easy you see a lot of poverty and you feel something about this these people have designs for your resource and this is what you see something else you see that you talk about americans don 't talk about this but you do there 's this thing this militarization of the world and it 's centered right in the united states and the united states is responsible for almost one half of the world 's military spending and you talk about it and back when saddam hussein was in power somehow the hub of democracy around the world they don 't seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world there are a lot of countries oil producing countries that aren 't very democratic but supported by the united states that 's odd oh these two wars the ten years of sanctions the eight years the tens of thousands the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths you can 't help but think that you talk about it it 's in the forefront of your mind he 's everyman once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly pain and sorrow everyone in your country has been touched by the violence the pain the horror everybody not a single person in your country has not been touched they 're christians they worship the christian god they have crosses they carry bibles their bibles have a little insignia that says us army on them and their leaders and they pray to their christian god and they they are iraqis they you read about it you hear about it they 're there to build schools and help people that 's what they want to do they do wonderful things but they also do the bad things and you can 't tell the difference the solution to the problem in the middle east according to him is to convert you all to christianity and you know that americans don 't read about this guy they don 't know anything about him but you do i mean this is serious you 're afraid he was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of iraq and you 're thinking my god if this guy is saying that then all the soldiers must be saying that and this word here george bush called this war a crusade man the americans them that 's what this is about and you 're thinking my god these christians are coming to kill us qurans right and you don 't laugh him off because in the context of course this is how americans think so people all over the middle east not just in your country are protesting mean this is what they 're about this is what you 're thinking as an arab muslim as an iraqi of course you 're going to think this they 're training their little kids to be soldiers for jesus they take little kids and run them through these things till they teach them how to say ' sir yes sir ' and things like ' grenade toss ' and ' weapons care and maintenance ' and go to the website it i mean these christians they or anybody says this is some little church in the middle of nowhere you don 't know that for you this is like all christians it 's all over the web bible boot camp and look at this that 's what they are to you so here of course you 've got it wrong and of course most of you don 't support the insurgency you don 't support killing americans you don 't support the terrorists of course you don 't very few step outside of your shoes now here comes the radical experiment so we 're all back home this woman she 's my sister my wife my cousin my neighbor she 's anybody to me these guys standing there everybody in the photo i feel this photo man so here 's what i want you to do let 's go back to my first example of the chinese i want you to go there it what i want you to do is picture her as a chinese woman receiving a chinese flag because her loved and the soldiers are chinese and everybody else is chinese as an american how do you feel about this picture what do you think about that scene it 's an american american soldiers american woman who lost her loved one what are you feeling and thinking about this photo about this woman now follow me on this because i 'm taking a big risk here they were caught by the american soldiers trying to kill americans can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks can you go there it shouldn 't be that difficult you just patriotic defenders can you feel their anger their fear their rage can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning bent down to their child and hugged their child and said i 'm going out to look out can you go there it 's also understanding [ understand ] now you might ask because you 're allowed to hate these people you 're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being and if i can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch one tiny inch then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life you can walk a mile when it comes to understanding why that person 's driving forty miles per hour in the passing lane or your teenage son little world of somebody and they build a big complex world what this is about attend to other lives other visions what i am saying is i understand and now perhaps perhaps you do"
