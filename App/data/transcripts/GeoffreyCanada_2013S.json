  "transcript": "and the last time i looked our children that we 're going to needlessly lose that we could right now we could save them all you saw the quality of the educators who were here it is absolutely possible why haven 't we fixed this we 're going to continue to do the and nobody nobody is getting crazy about it and there were kids who were failing in schools and those schools are still lousy today and you know something about a lousy school one size fits all if you get it fine and if you don 't tough luck just tough luck you go into a place that 's failed kids and you say so what 's the plan and they say we 'll we 're going to do what we did last year this year what kind of business model is that banks used to open and operate between ten and three they don 't need banks they got no money in the banks who created that business model right and it went on for decades you know why because they didn 't care they created something that worked for them how could you go to the bank when you were work it didn 't matter and they don 't care whether or not geoff is upset he can 't go to the bank go find another bank they all operate the same way right they might like that what what about introducing technology now look i 'm a technology fan but i have to admit to you all i 'm a little old so i was a little slow and i did not trust technology and when they first came out with those new contraptions i am never using that yet not in education why why is it that when we had rotary phones that we were teaching and if you come up with a plan to change things people consider you radical if the science says this is science not me that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime you see where they are in june because it suggests we should do something every ten years they reproduce the same study it the system decides you can 't run schools they said it was the agrarian calendar and people had but let me tell you why that doesn 't make sense i never you don 't plant crops in july and august you so who came up with this idea who owns it why did we ever do it so why don 't we we can do this how many places in america are going to change none we know that the problem begins immediately right this idea zero to three my wife yvonne and i we have four kids three grown ones and a 15 year old that 's a longer story we did not know the science about brain development we didn 't know the role that language call and response how important that was in developing those children what are we doing about it poor people don 't know know and we 're not doing anything to help them at all but we know this is critical now poor kids need that experience we know health we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about you know because i 'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff but i 'd say well you know a child who has cavities is not going to uh be able to study as well and you know what i tell them you know why i provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts because i actually like kids i actually like and you 've never read a study from mit that says but you will give that kid dance instruction and you will be thrilled that that kid and why shouldn 't poor kids have the same opportunity here 's the other thing and you find out it 's not working great no and you find out they didn 't get it but here 's the problem with they 'll tell you raheem really struggled couldn 't do two digit multiplication so great data but you 're getting it back after school is over you come back from vacation now you 've got all of this test data from last year you don 't look at it why so how much money did we just spend on all of that billions and billions of dollars for data that it 's too late to use i need that and i need to know whether or not what i did corrected that i need to know that this week i don 't need to know that at the end of the year when it 's too late because in my older years i 've become somewhat of a clairvoyant i can predict school and you tell me last year forty eight percent of those kids and i say okay what 's the plan what did we do from last year to this year you say we 're doing the same thing i 'm going to make a prediction this year somewhere between and i will be right every single time but we 're getting what so here 's the other issue that i just think we 've got to be concerned about we can 't stifle innovation in our they get angry if you do something different if you try something new people are always like ooh charter schools hey and here 's the rub some of it 's not going to work but we can 't confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn 't therefore do anything right imagine if that 's how we thought about technology every time something didn 't work we just they convinced me i 'm sure some of you were like me the palmpilot they told me geoff if you get this palmpilot you 'll never need another thing that thing lasted all of three weeks it was over i was so disgusted i spent my money on this thing did anybody stop inventing that shouldn 't stop you from from pushing the science forward there 's some stuff we know that we can do and we 've got to do better the evaluation we have to start with kids earlier we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people we 've got to give them all that we have to do but this innovation issue this idea that we 've got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical and this is something by the way that i think is going to be a challenge for our entire field america we have run out of time and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness about saying we can 't afford this what did we spend in afghanistan this year we 'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye the real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about i dare say what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems so once we do that i 'll no longer be angry one hundred percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school a hundred percent of them went to college this year 's seniors will have one hundred percent graduating high school ninety three percent accepted to college we 'd better get that other seven percent so that 's just how this goes so how do you stick with them after they they leave high school gc well you know one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids the same kids these same they call you they say i want to see your grades how 'd you do on that last test what are you talking about that you want to leave school and you 're not coming back here so a bunch of my kids know you can 't come back to harlem because geoff is and it gets a little bit to the grit issue when kids know that you refuse to let them fail and they 're like you know i don 't want to do this but i know my mother 's going to be mad well that matters we try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support but also a set of encouragements that say to them you can do it it is going to be hard but we refuse to let you fail"
