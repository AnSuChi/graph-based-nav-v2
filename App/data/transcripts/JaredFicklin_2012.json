  "transcript": "my passions are music technology and making things and on occasion has led me to play with fire this is a rubens ' tube it 's one of many i 've made over the years and i have one here tonight it 's about an 8 foot long tube of metal it 's got a hundred or so holes on top on that side is the speaker and here is some lab tubing and it 's connected to this tank so it 's okay to applaud the laws of physics but essentially what 's happening here and we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency and the height is showing us amplitude so let 's change the frequency of the sound and watch what happens to the fire so every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave and that emergent sine curve of fire so let 's turn that off we 're indoors 're indoors thank you i also have with me a flame table it 's very similar to a rubens ' tube and it 's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound such as eigenmodes so let 's fire it up and see what it does which is why i like to use it to watch geoff farina play guitar one you watch closely you may have seen some of the eigenmodes but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire actually a lot of things are better with fire in my world but the fire 's just a foundation it shows very well that eyes can hear and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound such as the removal of time so here i 'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song smells like teen spirit in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition so if i show you another song off this album and another your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band nirvana and in the frequency distribution the colors you can see the sound that they are famous for and i remind you that this is smells like teen spirit you can probably correctly guess without listening to any music at all that the song a die hard nirvana fan would enjoy is this song i and this is mabel davis skate park texas and the sounds you 're hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park and it sounds like chaos but actually all the tricks start with a very distinct whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park so if we were to render these sounds visually we might end up with something like this and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a and if you look really closely we can tease out traffic patterns you see the skaters often trick in this direction this kid shows up all the rest of the skaters turn their lines ninety degrees to stay out of his way you see there 's a subtle etiquette in the skate park led by key influencers and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks or wear red pants and on this day the mics picked that up and i wanted to use all eight hours of his cambridge lecture series to create an homage now in this series he 's speaking with the aid of a computer which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy a steering algorithm it listens to the lecture and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x axis and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y axis so there 's a lot of sentences so a lot of stars and after rendering all of the audio this is what we get this is stephen hawking 's universe it 's and the way i did that is i used their position in time in the lecture to place these stars into 3d space and with some custom software and a kinect i can walk right into the lecture i 'm going to wave through the kinect here and take control and now i 'm going to reach out and i 'm going to touch a star and when i do it will play the sentence that generated that star stephen hawking there is one and let me close with a work in progress i think after thirty years the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning all seen a lot of tedtalks online so let 's watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on and then applause starts it sometimes you get a little star applause and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath and let 's watch this clip again this time i 'm not going to talk at all there 's still going to be no audio but what i am going to do is i 'm going to render the sound so watch closely and see what your eyes can hear but on repeated views your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information you can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech things that you can 't get out of closed captioning that famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up from behind is something you can see and i believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all and i speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences i don 't know it 's a theory right now actually it 's all just an idea"
