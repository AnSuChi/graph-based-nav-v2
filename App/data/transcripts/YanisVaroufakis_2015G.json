  "transcript": "in the west we make a colossal mistake we see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is but we see it as part of our society 's furniture we mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy it doesn 't singapore 's lee kuan yew and his great imitators in beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism while politics remains while i was representing greece the newly elected greek government in the eurogroup as its finance minister i was told in no uncertain terms that our nation 's democratic process our elections could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in greece at that moment i felt that there could be no greater vindication of lee kuan yew or the chinese communist party indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything i want to present to you i want to ask you to join me in believing again that lee kuan yew the chinese communist party and indeed the eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy that we need an authentic boisterous democracy and without democracy our societies will be nastier our future bleak allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak i call it the twin peaks paradox one peak you understand you know it you recognize it is the mountain of debts that has been casting the whole world we all recognize the mountain of debts but few people discern its twin a mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts three point four trillion dollars on all the and so on and so forth $ three point four trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $ five point one trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries in our financial institutions doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices so a mountain of debt the result is stagnant wages more than a quarter of 25 to low aggregate demand which in a never ending cycle reinforces the pessimism of the investors reproduce it by not investing exactly like oedipus ' father his son would kill him this is my quarrel with capitalism its gross wastefulness all this idle cash should be energized to improve lives to develop human talents and indeed to finance all these technologies green technologies which are absolutely essential for saving planet earth aristotle defined democracy as the constitution now of course athenian democracy excluded but it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient athenian democracy on the basis of whom what was more pertinent and continues to be so about ancient athenian democracy who not only crucially they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight of state now of course athenian democracy didn 't last long our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient athens they have their roots in the magna carta in the one thousand six whereas athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor and indeed liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the leaving the economic sphere the corporate world if you want as now in our democracies today this separation of the economic from the political sphere the moment it started happening it gave rise to an inexorable epic struggle between the two with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere eating into its power have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be it 's not because their dna has degenerated it is rather because one can be in government today and not in power because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere which is separate i spoke about my quarrel with capitalism if you think about it it is a little bit like a population of predators that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on similarly the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself causing economic crisis corporate power is inequality is rising aggregate demand is falling and ceos of corporations are too scared so the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control like in ancient athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants this is not an original idea the marxist left had that idea one hundred years ago and it didn 't go very well did it the lesson that we learned from the soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be eliminate the working poor capitalism 's doing it by replacing automation including soon we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres but we 'd better do it lest we end up with a the technological innovations it is spawning the more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a matrix dystopia or something much closer to a star trek like society where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient i think we can afford but what would it take what would it look like in practical terms allow me to share just briefly a couple of examples at the level of the enterprise imagine a capital market where you earn capital as you work and where your capital follows you from one job to another from one company to another and the company whichever one you happen to work at at that time is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment then all income stems from capital from profits and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete no more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company no more investment and saving indeed no towering twin peaks at the level of the global political economy imagine for a moment with a universal digital currency one that is issued by the international monetary fund and imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency let 's call it the cosmos in units of cosmos with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country 's trade deficit or indeed to a country 's trade surplus especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce this is not a new idea it 's what effectively john maynard keynes proposed in the bretton woods conference especially in the context of a reunified sphere the world that i am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian in that it prioritizes empowered since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor will such a world dawn the answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively it is our choice and we 'd better make it democratically then marx is relevant because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand what larry summers refers to as secular stagnation with this crisis migrating from one part of the world as it is now it will destabilize not only our democracies so if this analysis holds water then marx is absolutely relevant but so is hayek that 's why i 'm a libertarian marxist and so is keynes so that 's why i 'm totally confused greek philosopher kind of thing to say yv that was einstein actually bg during your talk you mentioned singapore and china and last night at the speaker dinner you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the west looks at china in our liberal democracies we have a semblance of democracy it 's because we have confined as i was saying in my talk democracy to the political sphere while leaving the one sphere where all the action is the economic sphere a completely john stuart mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process so what you are seeing now in china is a very similar process to the one that we had in in britain during the industrial revolution especially the transition from the first to the second and to be castigating china for doing that which the west did in the i am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the finance minister of greece earlier this year yv i knew this was coming bg yes bg six months after how do you look back at the first half of the year yv and very disappointing because we had an opportunity to move away from which is threatening massively the whole of the european union process we had an opportunity on the basis of the greek program which by the way was the first program to manifest that denial in the eurogroup this is the experience of the soviet union when you try to to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive through political will and through authoritarianism you may succeed in prolonging it but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically bg what kind of change are you foreseeing yv well there 's no doubt that if we don 't change the architecture of the eurozone the eurozone has no future bg did you make any mistakes when you were finance minister anything else for that matter who tells you after six months in a job especially i was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground and there wasn 't they were simply and because they didn 't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in greece we lost one third of our nominal gdp this is worse than the great depression and no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say a colossal mistake bg despite all this and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion you seem to be remaining quite pro european yv absolutely look my criticism of the european union and the eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes europe my greatest fear is that the eurozone will not survive because if it doesn 't the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic and they will destroy the european union and that will be catastrophic not just for europe but for the whole global economy we are probably the largest economy and if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern one thousand nine hundred and thirty 's which seems to me to be what we are doing then that will be detrimental to the future of europeans and bg we definitely hope you are wrong on that point yanis thank you for coming to ted"
