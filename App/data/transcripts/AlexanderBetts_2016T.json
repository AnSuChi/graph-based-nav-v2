  "transcript": "never before has the phrase i am british elicited so much pity we tend to have historically imposed change on others but done much less of it ourselves so it came as an immense shock to me when i woke up on the morning of june twenty four to discover that my country had voted to leave the european union my prime minister had resigned and it was an immense shock for many people created a complete political meltdown in my country we could ask the opposition for a replay the educated blamed the less well educated that complete meltdown was made even worse by the most tragic element of levels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of britain at a level that i have never seen before in my lifetime or as one of my colleagues put it whether we 're about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park floating in the atlantic ocean but my question is really should we have the degree of shock that we 've experienced since but for all hindsight is a wonderful thing it highlights in ways that we seem embarrassingly unaware of how divided our societies are the vote split along lines of age young people didn 't turn out to vote in great numbers but those that did wanted to remain older people while in other parts of the country there was very the fault line of contemporary politics is between those that and these represent a desire for people to take back control of their own lives and the feeling that they are but those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation they represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders what i want to suggest is the picture is more complicated than that that liberal the blue areas show remain and the red areas leave when i looked at this what personally struck me was the very little time in my life i 've actually spent in many of the red i suddenly realized that looking at the top fifty areas in the uk that have the strongest leave vote i 've spent a combined total of four days of my life in those areas and it suggested that people like me who think of ourselves open and tolerant perhaps don 't know our own countries and societies nearly as well as we like to believe and the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way to narrate globalization to those people that don 't get opportunities to travel they may be unpersuaded by the narrative that we find persuasive in our often liberal bubbles it means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand in the leave vote a minority have peddled the politics of fear and hatred when the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration from outside the european this was a protest vote for many and so they rejected that political establishment this replicates around europe and much of the liberal orbn in hungary so the question i think we need to ask is my second question which is how should we collectively respond for all of us who care about creating liberal open tolerant societies we urgently need a new vision that vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization but globalization also has redistributive effects it creates winners and that importantly low skilled immigration can lead to a reduction in wages for the most impoverished in our societies and also put pressure but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them bigotry and ignorance are the ugly face of exclusionary and antagonistic globalization that idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in two thousand and eight in a conference on progressive governance involving many but amid austerity and the financial crisis of two thousand and eight the concept disappeared almost without a trace globalization has been taken to support it 's perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all so the question is how can we achieve that goal how can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation while on the other hand refusing vehemently to give in to xenophobia and nationalism that is the question for all of us and i think as a social that social science offers some places to start it 's been suggested that we 've moved and lies have equal status to the clarity of evidence so how can we but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps in two thousand although it obviously didn 't unpack causality because this could equally be to do not so much with numbers but the political and media narrative around it about the nature of immigration the public believed that levels of asylum were a greater proportion of immigration than they were but they also believed the levels of educational migration were far lower as a proportion of overall migration than they actually are so we have to address this misinformation the gap between perception and reality on key aspects of globalization the second thing that i think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage london and the southeast have the highest numbers of we need to encourage even on a local and national level more movement more participation more interaction with people who we don 't know and whose views we might not necessarily agree with and this is really fundamental it shows tragically that those people who voted to leave the european union were those who actually benefited the most materially from trade with the european union but the problem is that those people in those areas didn 't perceive themselves to be beneficiaries they didn 't believe that they were actually getting access to material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world we can 't just benefit the refugee populations we also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas health furthermore if we 're going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they too have to take people with them the fourth and final idea i want to put forward is an idea that we need more responsible politics what we can see is there 's huge variation across different countries and time periods in those countries for attitudes and like migration and mobility on the one hand and free trade on the other but one hypothesis that i think emerges from a cursory look at that data is the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization it 's the societies like sweden in the past like canada where there is a centrist politics where right and left work together that we encourage supportive attitudes towards globalization and what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization a failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics and a gap in terms of that liberal center ground that can encourage communication and a shared understanding but at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media to drop a language of fear and be far more tolerant of one another and that 's in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project i am still am still european i am still a global citizen for those of us who believe that our identities are not mutually exclusive we have to all work together only then will we truly reconcile"
