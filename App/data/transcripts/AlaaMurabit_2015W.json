  "transcript": "the passenger next to me and i had a very interesting conversation he told me it seems like the united states has run out of tornado chaser a couple of seconds later he asked me so what do you do and because of my work i recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion now this matter is vitally important to me as a young muslim woman i am very proud of my faith but i can 't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion the misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture has influenced our social and cultural norms our laws our daily lives to a point where we sometimes don 't recognize it my parents moved from libya north africa to canada in the early but growing up i saw my parents but among others they were kind and funny the kind of patience that having eleven kids forces you to have and they were fair i was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens i i was never taught that god judged differently based on gender and my parents ' understanding of god as a merciful and beneficial friend and provider shaped the way i looked at the world of course my upbringing had additional benefits being one of eleven children is diplomacy one hundred and one to this day i am asked where i went to school like did you go to kennedy school of government and i look at them and i 'm like no i went to the murabit school of international affairs it 's extremely exclusive you would have to talk to my mom to get in lucky for you she 's here you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace but the most important lesson i learned growing up i had to be there when she was trying to find out how and by who because i had to defend myself i am not speaking from experience of course i completed high school and i moved from canada saskatoon i very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect of religion the words haram meaning religiously prohibited meaning culturally inappropriate were exchanged carelessly and even and it surprised me how easy it was to find women in my so why weren 't we learning about her why weren 't we learning about these women why were women being relegated to positions and why if we are equal in the eyes of god are we not equal in the eyes of men to me it all came back to the lessons i had learned as a child and unfortunately in every single are not women then we can 't realistically expect to have full economic and political participation of women our foundation is broken my mom actually says you can 't build a straight house on a crooked foundation and it was the first time that i felt it was not only acceptable for me to be involved but it was encouraged it was demanded we weren 't holding hands or turns out that 's not that easy it only took a few weeks before the women that i had previously worked with were returning back to their previous roles and most of them were driven by words of encouragement from religious and political leaders most of whom cited religious scripture as their defense it 's how they gained popular support for their opinions so initially i focused on the economic and political empowerment of women i thought that but not a lot and i began to cite and highlight islamic scripture as well in two thousand and twelve and two thousand and thirteen my organization we entered homes and schools and universities even mosques i used scripture i used verses from the quran and sayings of the prophet hadiths his sayings which are for example the best of you is the best to their family do not let your brother oppress another for the first time friday sermons led by local community imams promoted the rights of women they discussed taboo issues like violence policies were changed in certain communities we actually had to go as far so really the united nations just copied us it 's not liberals i 've heard everything from your parents must be extremely ashamed of you false they 're my biggest fans and i remain but we have we have to stop giving up our position because by remaining silent we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide we completely challenging distorted religious messaging not for us but for societies that would be transformed with the participation of women thank you"
