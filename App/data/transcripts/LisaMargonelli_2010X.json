  "transcript": "oily hot summer and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted but before i talk about the political chemistry this is a photograph from when i visited prudhoe bay in alaska in two thousand and two to watch the minerals management service testing and what you see here is you see a little bit of crude oil you see some ice cubes and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm the and the thing is is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the american consumer we 're four percent of the world until you check out its molecules and you don 't really understand that until you see this stuff i highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday because you will never need to hear another oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules it starts of with the very small ones which are one carbon four hydrogen that 's methane it just floats off then there 's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon you 've probably heard of benzene rings they 're very those are called the asphaltenes they 're an ingredient in asphalt they 're very important in oil spills let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water it is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous oil doesn 't sink and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water it spreads out to be really thin so you have a hard time corralling it the next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate and some of the toxic things float into the water column and and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that and shrimp and then the asphaltenes and this is the crucial thing the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion and it makes it very hard to handle it also makes it very viscous when the prestige sank off the coast of spain there were big floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil with the consistency or the viscosity of chewing gum it 's incredibly hard to clean up and every single oil is different when it hits water american consumers will kind of see the oil they have a eureka moment when we suddenly understand oil in a different context nobody gets up in the morning and thinks wow i 'm going to go buy some molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work no they think ugh i have to go buy gas i 'm so angry about it the oil companies are ripping me off they set the prices and i don 't even know i am helpless over this and this is what happens to us at the gas pump and actually gas you might notice that many gas pumps including this one are designed to look like atms i 've talked to engineers that 's specifically to diffuse our anger because supposedly we feel good about atms that shows you how bad it is but actually i mean this feeling of helplessness comes in because most americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy not of of the vicissitudes of the world it 's much more important to have a car that runs to have a job and keep a job than to have a ged and that 's actually very perverse now there 's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas which is that we 'd rather be doing anything this is bp 's gas station in downtown los angeles it is green it is a shrine to greenishness now you think why would something so lame work on people so smart well the reason is is because when we 're buying and we get kind of in on our own con funny it looks funny here but in fact that 's why the slogan beyond petroleum worked but and so cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil and it 's really important to dealing with this oil spill the oil industry is like a huge gigantic octopus of of engineering but we actually see it in very moral terms this is an early on photograph you can see we had these gushers long before it became funny and then of course there was john d rockefeller and the thing about john d is that he went into this chaotic wild east of oil industry and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company a multinational it was terrifying you think walmart is a terrifying business model now imagine what this looked like in the and it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy but what 's really amazing is that ida tarbell the journalist went in and did a big expos of rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place but in many ways image of the conspiracy still sticks with us and here 's one of the things that that ida tarbell said she said he has a thin nose like a thorn there were no lips there were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them laughter okay so that guy is actually still with us so you might be wondering why it is that every time we have high oil prices or an oil and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them and so i 'm not saying these guys aren 't liable to answer questions i 'm just saying that when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards you don 't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate or you 're going to get around to but it makes for good theater and it 's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week i mean these pictures this is from the santa barbara spill you have these pictures of birds they really influence people when the santa barbara spill happened it also the clean air act the clean water act everything that we are really stemmed from this period i think it 's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us here we are normally we 're standing at the gas pump and we 're feeling kind of helpless we look at these pictures and we understand for the first time our role in this supply chain we connect the dots in the supply chain and we have this but it 's also really important that we don 't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it we actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem one of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms we were very reactive as opposed to being proactive about what happened and so what we did was actually we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling we stopped drilling in anwr but we didn 't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed in fact it 's continued to increase the only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices as you can see our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out we only have two percent of the world 's oil reserves since one thousand nine the country of nigeria or the part of nigeria that pumps oil which is the delta which is two times the size of maryland has had thousands of oil spills a year i mean we 've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations but in fact these guys actually live in a war zone there 's a thousand battle related deaths a year in this area twice the size of of maryland and it 's all related to the oil and these if they were in the u s they might be actually here in this room they have degrees in political science degrees in business they 're entrepreneurs they don 't actually want to be doing what they 're doing and it 's sort of one of the other the other groups of people who pay a price for us the other thing that we 've done as we 've continued to increase demand is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs one of the places we put in a big oil project in chad with exxon so the u s taxpayer paid for it the world bank exxon paid for it we put it in there was a tremendous banditry problem i was there in two thousand and three we were driving along this dark and the guy in the green stepped out and i was just like ahhh this is it and then the guy in the in the exxon uniform stepped out and we realized it was okay they have their own private sort of army around them at the oil but at the same time chad has become much more unstable and we are not paying for that price at the pump we pay for it in our taxes on april 15th we do the same thing with the price of of policing the persian gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open this is one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight we actually bombed two iranian oil platforms that year that was the beginning of an escalating u s involvement there that we do not pay for at we pay for it on april 15th and we can 't even calculate the cost of this involvement the other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the gulf of mexico which was not part of the moratoriums now it doesn 't have the same resonance for us that the arctic national wildlife refuge has but it should i mean it 's a bird sanctuary also every time you buy gasoline in the united states half of it is actually being refined along the coast because the gulf actually has about fifty percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work generally in a fairly crummy car if you look at people who make $ fifty thousand a year they have two kids gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the american economy but they 're also a drain on individual families and it 's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher so what i 'm going to talk to you about now is what do we have to do this time what are the laws what do we have to do to keep ourselves focused one thing is we need to stay away from the theater we need to stay one of the things that we also need to do is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world before you reduce the amount of oil that we use we what you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in and the un useful stuff which is called the rejected energy the waste goes up to the top now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount and one of the things that we need to do is not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient but we also need to fix the economy in general we need to remove the perverse incentives to we actually encourage people to drive more we have policies that reward sprawl we have all kinds of policies we need to have more mobility choices whether that 's getting a much more efficient car and and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road this is where we need to be and you can find more about this policy it 's called strong which is secure transportation at newamerica net what 's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump to actually being active i actually i agree that a dollar nine cents the following year all the way up to thirty cents by two thousand and twenty that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption and at the same time we would give people time to prepare time to hypothetically for a year from now the first thing that you have on the tax is you have a tax for a stronger america thirty three cents so you 're not helpless at the pump and the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack and what it says is the national academy of sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates the hope is that you you start to be connected to the whole greater system and at the same time you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting or a different kind of car or whatever it is you 're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence but in order to do this one of the things we really need to do is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get thank you"
