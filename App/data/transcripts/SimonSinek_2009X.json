  "transcript": "or better how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions for example why is apple so innovative year after year after year they 're more innovative than all their competition they have the same access to the same talent the same agencies the same consultants the same media then why is it that they seem to have something different why is it that martin luther king he wasn 't the only man who suffered in and why is it that the wright brothers were able to figure out controlled powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified better funded and they didn 't achieve powered man flight and the wright brothers beat them to it there there 's something else at play here and this discovery profoundly changed my view as it turns out there 's a pattern as it turns out all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world whether it 's apple or martin luther king or the wright brothers they all think and it 's the complete opposite to everyone else and it 's probably the world 's simplest idea i call it the golden circle this little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren 't let me define the terms really quickly one hundred percent whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your usp but very very few people organizations know why they do what they do why does your organization exist and why should anyone care but the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations regardless of their size regardless of their industry all think act and communicate from the inside out let me give you an example i use apple because they 're easy to understand and everybody gets it if apple were like everyone else a marketing message from them might sound like this want to buy one meh that 's how most of us communicate that 's how most marketing and sales are done that 's how we communicate interpersonally we say what we do we say how we 're different or better and we expect some sort a purchase a vote something like that here 's our new law firm it gets great gas mileage it has but it 's uninspiring here 's how apple actually communicates everything we do we believe in challenging the status quo we believe in thinking differently the way we challenge the status want to buy one people buy why you do it room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from apple but we 're also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from apple or a phone from apple or a dvr from apple gateway came out with flat screen monitors for years nobody bought one dell came out with mp3 players and pdas well designed products and nobody bought one in fact talking about it now we can 't even imagine buying an but we do it every day people don 't buy what you do they buy why you do it the goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have it 's all grounded in the tenets of biology from the top down the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle our newest brain our homo sapien brain our neocortex corresponds with the what level the neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language middle two sections make up our limbic brains and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings like trust all decision making and it has no capacity for language in other words when we communicate from the outside in yes people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures when we can communicate from the inside out we 're talking directly to the part of the brain this is where gut decisions come from sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures and they say i know what all the facts and details say but it just doesn 't feel right why would we use that verb it doesn 't the best we can muster up is i don 't know it just doesn 't feel right or sometimes you say you 're leading with your heart or soul i hate to break it to you those aren 't it 's all happening here in your limbic brain the part of the brain that controls decision making and not language and people then how will you ever get people to to vote for you or buy something from you or more importantly be loyal the goal is not just to hire people i always say that you know if you hire people just because they can do a job they 'll work for your money but if they believe what you believe they 'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears nowhere else is there a better example than with the wright brothers and back in the early the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day everybody was trying it and samuel pierpont langley had what we assume to be the recipe for success even now you ask people why did your product or why did your company fail and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things under capitalized the wrong people bad market conditions it 's always the same three things so let 's explore that samuel pierpont langley was given fifty thousand dollars by the war department to figure out this flying machine money was no problem the new york times followed him around orville and wilbur wright they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success they had no money they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop not a single person on the wright brothers ' team had a college education not even orville or the difference was orville and wilbur were driven by a cause by a purpose by a belief they believed that if they could figure out this flying machine it he was in pursuit of the result he was in pursuit of the and lo and behold look what happened the people who believed the others just worked for the paycheck they tell stories of how every time the wright brothers went out they would have to take five sets of parts because that 's how many times they would crash before supper and eventually on december 17th one thousand nine hundred and three the wright he could have said that 's an amazing discovery guys and i will improve upon your technology he didn 't get famous so he quit if you talk about what you something called the law of diffusion of innovation if you don 't know the law you know the terminology the first two point five % of our population are our innovators the next the next thirty four % are your early majority your late majority and your laggards the only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can 't buy rotary phones anymore we all sit at various places at various times on this scale but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass market success or acceptance of an idea you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between fifteen and eighteen percent market penetration and then the system tips i love asking businesses what 's your conversion on new business they love to tell you it 's about ten percent proudly well you can trip over ten % of the customers we all have about ten % who just get it that 's how we describe them right that 's like that gut feeling oh they just get it the problem is how do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who don 't get it so it 's this here this little gap that you have to close as jeffrey moore calls it crossing the chasm because you see the early majority will not try something until someone else they 're comfortable making those gut they 're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available these are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iphone when they first came out when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week these are the people who spent forty thousand dollars on flat screen tvs when they first came out even though the technology was substandard by the way they didn 't do it because the technology was so great it 's because they wanted to be first people don 't buy what you do they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe in line for six hours they were first so let me give you a famous example a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation first the famous failure it as we said before the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions you should have success then they are the single i mean we use tivo as verb i tivo stuff on my piece of junk time warner dvr all the time but tivo 's a commercial they 've never made money and when they went ipo their stock was at about thirty or forty dollars and then plummeted and it 's never traded above ten in fact i don 't think it 's even traded above six except for a couple of little spikes because you see when tivo launched their product they told us all what they had rewinds live tv and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking we don 't like it you 're scaring us what if they had said if you 're the kind of person boy do we have a product for you it pauses live tv skips commercials memorizes your viewing habits people don 't buy what you do they buy why you do it and what you do simply serves as the proof now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation in the summer of one thousand nine two hundred and fifty thousand people showed up on the mall in washington to they sent out no invitations and there was no website to check the date how do you do that well but he had a gift he didn 't go around telling people what needed to change in america he went around and told people what he believed i believe i believe he told people and people who believed what he believed took his cause and they made it their own and they told people and some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people two hundred and fifty thousand people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak how many of them showed up for him it 's what they believed and it wasn 't about black versus white twenty five % of the audience was white dr king believed that there are two types of laws in this world those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men and not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world by the way he gave listen to politicians now with their comprehensive 12 point plans they 're not inspiring anybody but those who lead whether they 're individuals or and it 's those who start with why that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them thank you very much"
