  "transcript": "of the ted audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective intelligent intellectual however i i also have reason to believe that many if not most of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly now what was for me a very expensive pair of shoes but those shoes came with round nylon laces and i couldn 't keep them tied so i went back to the store and said to the owner i love the shoes but i hate the laces a look and said oh you 're tying them wrong i would have thought that by age fifty one of the life skills that i had really nailed was tying my shoes but not so let me demonstrate this is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes as it turns out thank you wait there 's more as it turns out you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe if we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow and if you pull the cords under the knot you will see that this is a stronger knot it will come untied less often it will let you down less and not only that it looks better we do this one more time start as usual go the other way around the loop this is a little hard for children but i think you can handle it pull the knot there it is the strong form of the shoe knot now in keeping with today 's theme"
