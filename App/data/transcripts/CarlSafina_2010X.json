  "transcript": "this is the ocean as i used to know it and i find that since i 've been in the gulf a couple of times i really kind of am traumatized because whenever i look at the ocean now no matter where i am even where i know that none of the oil has gone i sort of see slicks and i 'm finding that i 'm very much haunted but what i want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context not just about the oil eruption but what it means and why it has happened and now i mainly write books about how the ocean is changing and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly now we saw this graphic earlier on that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to you would get that little sphere of gas on the right so we live on the most fragile little soap bubble you can imagine a very sacred soap bubble but one that is very very easy to and all the burning of oil and coal and gas so the blowout in the gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization now in the laboratory if you take a clam and you put it in the ph that is not eight point one which is the normal ph of seawater but seven point five if you take a sea urchin larva from eight point one put it in a ph of seven point seven not a huge change already commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem so this really matters now let 's take a little tour around the gulf a little bit things that really impresses me about the people in the gulf they are really really aquatic people and they can handle water they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes when the water goes down they know what to do they don 't have many options in fact those entire communities really don 't have many options they don 't have another thing they can do they can 't go and work in the local hotel business because there if you go to the it looks pretty unbelievable it looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car and you just dumped in the ocean and one of the really most incredible things i think is that there 's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic it 's really messy if you go to the places where it 's just and they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach they 're not allowed to put more than ten pounds of sand in a 50 gallon plastic bag they have thousands and thousands of plastic bags i don 't know what they 'll do with all that stuff meanwhile there are still people trying to use the beach they don they 're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals it 's a mess if you go to where the they go to work they always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the gulf they 're finding that their world is really collapsing and so you can see literally signs of signs of their anger and signs of their grief these are the things that you can see there underwater well some people say there are oil plumes some people say there are not oil plumes going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes and i created a little oil spill in the gulf of mexico and then and you add a little and you get a big mess a big mess that you can 't clean you can 't touch you can 't extract and i think most importantly this is what i think i think but as many people have said 's a large attempt to suppress what 's going on personally i think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene and then it is attacked because they don 't want the evidence in we heard that bacteria eat oil so do sea turtles when it breaks up it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria i heard the most incredible story today when i was on the train coming here a writer named ted williams he was asking me a couple of questions about what i saw because he 's writing an article for audubon magazine he said that he had been in the gulf a little while ago like about a week ago and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what 's going on that guide 's entire calendar year is everybody wanted their deposit back everybody is fleeing that 's the story of thousands of people but he told ted that on the last day he went out a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat and he and he knew that the dolphins scare fish so he moved away from it turned around a few minutes later it was right next to the side of the boat again he said that in thirty years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that and he felt that he felt that it was coming to ask for help sorry now in the exxon valdez spill about thirty percent of the killer whales died in so the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable it 's going to take the other thing about the gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the the gulf is a really important piece of water more important than a similar volume of water in the open atlantic ocean you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the slick they 're probably having at the very least a catastrophic spawning season this year i 'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water i don 't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills i don 't know if it 'll affect the adults if it 's not it 's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae i would certainly think but if you look at that graph that goes the leak the eruption is a catastrophe i think it 's important to keep in mind that we 've done a lot to affect what 's in the ocean for a very very long time it 's not like we 're starting with starting with something that 's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with and they populate much larger areas for instance most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds they were all on the gulf in may while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places down on the lower i saw birds that breed in greenland so this is a hemispheric issue the economic effects go at least nationally in many ways i think that this is one of the most absolutely examples of total unpreparedness that i can even think of even when the japanese bombed pearl harbor at least they shot back and we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do there was nothing and you know as we can see by what they 're doing mainly what they 're doing is booms and dispersants the booms are absolutely not made for open water they don 't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated they get near shore look at these two boats that one on the right is called and i think you know that 's a great name for boats that think that they 're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the gulf right now with oil at the surface the dispersants so it 's just you can see easily 's adjacent shoreline that doesn 't have any booms there is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them and that lower photo well and that and that booming a bird colony these birds make a living by diving into the water in fact really what i think they should do if anything they 're trying so hard to protect those nests actually if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds and that would be better for them this year as far as cleaning them but really where are those birds going to get released to it 's like taking somebody out of a burning building them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building because the oil is still gushing i think that this is the result of gross negligence not just bp bp operated and they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that is supposed to be our government protecting us and you have to really wonder who are the laws made for and who has gotten above the laws and there are things that we can do in the future we could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need it would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making thirty thousand holes in the sea floor of the gulf of mexico looking for oil oil might start coming out of one of them and you 'd have some idea of what to do that 's certainly one of the things we need to do but i think we have to understand where this leak really started from it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it 's our government meant to protect the larger public interest so i think that the oil blowout we still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people and even though the police can be a little annoying at times giving us tickets and stuff like that nobody says that we should just get rid of them but in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least thirty years there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from buying the government out from under us this has been a problem for a very very long time you can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of america and even thomas jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country they would tell these corporations to go to hell so what we really need to do is regain the idea that it 's our government safeguarding our interests and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost i think there are signs of hope we seem to be waking up a little bit the glass steagall act which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts that was put in effect in one thousand nine was systematically destroyed now there 's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place but the are already there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed so it 's a continued fight it 's a historic moment right now we 're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe or we will make the moment we need out of this as many people have noted today there 's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this we 've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling the first offshore wells were called whales the first offshore drills were called harpoons we emptied the ocean of the whales at that time we lit something on fire and that is still what we 're doing we 're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy and people say we can 't have clean energy because it 's too expensive and people saying the economy cannot withstand thank you very much"
