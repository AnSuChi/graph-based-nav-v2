  "transcript": "so what does it mean for a machine to we will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism and the research to achieve it with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters or quads for short quads have been around for a long time they 're so popular these days because they 're mechanically simple yaw and accelerate along their common orientation on board are also a battery a computer various sensors and wireless radios how did it just do that it 's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them which is also running estimation and control algorithms so how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete we use something broadly called model based design we first capture the physics with a mathematical model we then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them we then manipulate these equations let me demonstrate the strength of this approach suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole with a little bit it becomes a little bit more difficult notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top you can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced once we have a model of the combined we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it here you see that it 's stable and it goes back using this made out of reflective markers i can point to where i want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me the key to these acrobatic maneuvers is designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory let 's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop and i will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world notice how the quad lost altitude when i put this glass of water on it unlike the balancing pole i did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system in fact the system doesn 't even know that the glass is there like before i could use the pointer to tell the quad where i want it to be in space why doesn 't the water fall out of the glass the first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way the second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass pointing up the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects which at these speeds are negligible that 's why you don 't need to model the glass it naturally doesn 't spill no matter what the quad does high performance tasks are easier than others and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard in this instance carrying a glass of water is easy balancing a pole is hard we 've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured can a machine also perform because there are four degrees of freedom to control but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs if we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working we discover that there 's an unconventional way to fly it but roll pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible in this instance this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures we can 't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver diver somersaulting into the water or when a vaulter is twisting in the air the ground fast approaching suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started instead what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly observe how it finishes similar to the diver and the vaulter it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports how do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort this quad has a racket strapped onto its head we first figure out where the ball we then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from third a trajectory is planned the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball they can do it collectively these three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net an extremely dynamic and notice that at full extension these quads are vertical in fact when fully extended this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch the algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me mathematical models are used to continuously re plan a cooperative strategy fifty times per second everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities what happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being what i have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor we now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures it 's trying to stay at a fixed point in space and moves back to where it wants to be we can use mathematical models to estimate the force that i 'm applying to the quad once we know this force we can also change the laws of physics as far as the quad is concerned of course we now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine i will use this new capability to position this camera carrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this demonstration so we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics okay here goes why exactly are they building machine athletes others think that it has more of a social role that it 's used to bind the group we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits what impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life like all our past creations and innovations they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused this is not a technical choice we are faced with it 's a social one let 's make the right choice that brings out the best in the future of machines just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain they 're the current members of the flying machine arena research team mark muller and robin ritz look out for them they 're destined for great things thank you"
