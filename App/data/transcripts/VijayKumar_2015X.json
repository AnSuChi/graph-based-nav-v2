  "transcript": "we build autonomous aerial robots like the one you see flying here so without gps it 's hard for robots like this to determine their position cameras and laser scanners to scan the environment it detects features from allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision free manner what i want to show you next so here you 'll see on the top right what the robot sees with the which is recognizable by the clutter that you see but the main point i want to convey to you is that these robots are capable of building at five centimeters resolution allowing somebody who is outside the lab or outside the building to deploy these the second problem is that these robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive a laser scanner a camera and the processors that drives up the cost of this robot so we asked ourselves a question what consumer product can you buy in an electronics store that is inexpensive that 's lightweight that has sensing onboard and computation and we invented the flying phone so this robot uses a samsung galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf looking at the corners of the flying autonomously that joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy giuseppe can kill it in addition to building these small robots pitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction the main point is we can have gracefully coordinating its wings its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water can go fishing too in this case this is a philly cheesesteak hoagie that it 's grabbing out of thin air so which is faster than walking speed coordinating its arms its claws split second timing to achieve this maneuver experiment i want to show you how the robot adapts its flight so in order to accomplish this it actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude and swing the payload through so if you look at honeybees and this is a slowed down video they 're so small the inertia is so lightweight that they don 't care they bounce off my hand for example this is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior and smaller is better because along with the small size you get lower inertia along with lower inertia and that makes you more robust so if i normalize that to its size it 's like a boeing seven hundred and eighty seven traveling ten times the speed of sound and i want to show you an example and this illustrates in my lab as we developed these robots we start off with these big robots and then now we 're down to these small robots and if you plot a histogram of the number of band aids we 've ordered in the past that sort of tailed off now because these robots are really safe and nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages and this is quite challenging because now you have to think about networks of robots and within each robot you have to think about the interplay of sensing communication computation they need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors so this video illustrates the basic idea you have four robots one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator literally they essentially follow and here there 's a single person able to lead this network of followers so again it 's not because all the robots know where they 're supposed to go it 's because they 're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors and this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity key idea is that and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation or how many robots you pull out it 's aware of the fact that it needs to to form the circular shape but collaborating with its neighbors it forms the shape without central coordination and you 'll see these robots start from a circular formation let me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in the first one has to do with agriculture which is probably the biggest problem that we 're facing worldwide and that 's mostly because of water shortage crop diseases climate change so what can robots do well we adopt an approach that 's called precision farming in the community and the basic idea is that we fly aerial robots so just like personalized medicine while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient what we 'd like to do is build models of individual plants fertilizer and pesticide here you 'll see robots traveling through an apple orchard and in a minute you 'll see two of its companions doing the same thing on the left side within the map is a map of every plant in this orchard is an infrared camera and on the bottom left is a thermal camera and on the main panel you reconstruction of every tree in the orchard as the sensors fly right past the trees the first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple count the number of fruits on every tree by doing this you tell the farmer how many fruits she has in every tree and allow her to estimate the yield in the orchard so if you know this leaf area you essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant which again tells you how healthy each plant is by combining visual and infrared information we can also compute indices such as ndvi and in this particular case you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops this is easily discernible not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery but robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously and then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem in this section of the orchard and we 're projecting yields lastly i want you to applaud the people who actually create the future yash loianno who are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw"
