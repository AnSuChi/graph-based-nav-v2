  "transcript": "so here is a complete picture of the universe about 14 odd billion years ago all energy is concentrated into a single point of energy for some reason it explodes and you begin to get and these things expand and expand and expand into these giant galaxies and you get trillions of them and i want you to pay particular attention to the three little prongs in the center of this picture if you take a close up of those they and what you 're looking at is columns of dust where there 's so much dust by the way the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles and what 's happening is there 's so much dust it comes together and it fuses and so what you 're watching is the birth of stars these are stars being born out of here when enough stars come out they create a galaxy this one happens to be a particularly important galaxy because you are here laughter and as you take a close up of this galaxy you find a relatively normal not particularly interesting star and then what happens is there 's enough dust left over that it doesn 't ignite into a star it becomes a and this is about a and that creates life and life starts to expand and expand and expand until it and we don 't appear until about ninety nine point nine six percent of the time so within that context there 's two theories of the case as to why we 're all here the first theory of the case is that 's all she wrote under that theory we are the be all and end all of all and the reason for trillions of galaxies sextillions of planets is to create something that looks like that and something that looks like that and then it flat lines it doesn 't get any better the only question you might want to ask yourself is could that be just mildly arrogant and if it is and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction there were only about two thousand of our species left a few more weeks without rain we would have never seen any of these so maybe you have to think about a second theory if the first one isn 't good enough second theory is could we upgrade well why would one ask a question like that because there have been at least twenty nine upgrades so far of we found this one last year wouldn 't it be really odd if you went to africa and asia and antarctica and found exactly the same bird and if that is the normal of affairs then you might ask yourself all right so if we want to create something else how big does a mutation have to be well svante paabo has the answer the difference between humans and neanderthal is zero point zero zero four percent of gene code that 's how big the difference is one species to another this explains most contemporary political debates but as you 're thinking about this one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place and those are the specific genes we 're continuing to mutate so about ten thousand years ago by the black sea we had one mutation in one gene and this is continuing and continuing and continuing and as it continues one of the things that 's going to happen this year is we 're going to discover the first ten thousand human genomes because it 's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing and when we find these we may find differences and by the way this is not a debate that we 're ready for because we have really misused the science in this in the 1920s we thought there were major differences between people american neurological association took this really far that got exported and was really misused in fact it led to some absolutely horrendous and as we think about that we 're actually beginning to find things like do you have an ace gene why would that matter because nobody 's ever climbed an that doesn 't have an ace gene and if you want to get more specific how about well it turns out that every male olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants do you want the olympics to be a showcase for really hardworking mutants option number two because you have one and you don 't have one i 'll give you a tenth of a second head start version number three because this is a naturally occurring gene and you 've got it and you didn 't pick the right parents you get the right to upgrade if these differences are the difference between an olympic medal and a non olympic medal we human beings today 's corrections deletions augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child 's play but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print and as these technologies go you keep seeing this you keep seeing this you keep seeing things two thousand human genome sequence and as you 're thinking about these two guys sequencing a human genome in two thousand and the public project sequencing the human genome in two thousand then you don 't hear a lot until you hear about an experiment last year in china where they take skin cells from this mouse put four chemicals on it let the stem cells grow and create a full copy of that mouse that 's a big deal and then it gets so crowded after sixteen divisions and as they pick that and these become macrophages and these become t cells but it 's really hard once you ski down to get back up and what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part and as you think of that what it means is potentially you can rebuild a full copy of any organism out of any one of its cells but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells and then what they did in october is they took skin cells turned them into stem cells maybe you also want to take your mind and one of the things you saw at ted about a year and a half ago was this guy but in essence what he said is you can take retroviruses which get inside brain cells of mice you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them and you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees then you can take a fiber optic cable you can image it in two colors which means you can download this information as binary code directly into a computer so what 's the bottom line on that well it 's and this might have just one or two small ethical political moral implications here 's the kind of questions that are becoming interesting questions for philosophers for governing people for and as you think about it let me close with an example of the brain both because of the inputs which are becoming massive and because of the plasticity of the organ is the brain here 's what it looks like in two thousand here 's what it looks like in two thousand and two and we still don 't know why this is happening what we do know is potentially the brain is reacting in a hyperactive and this is only one of the conditions that 's out there you 've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart people who can remember everything they 've seen in their lives people who 've got synesthesia people who 've got but one question you might want to ask is are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data and as you 're thinking there really needs to be more research on this one option is the fast food fetish there 's beginning to be some evidence that obesity and diet have something to do with gene modifications which may or may not have an impact on how the brain of an infant works a second option is the sexy geek option these conditions are highly rare applause but what 's beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together because they are highly qualified for computer programming and it is so this is the assortative mating hypothesis of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures we 're trying to process so much stuff that some people get synesthetic and just have huge pipes that remember everything other people get amount of information other people react with various psychological conditions or reactions to this information or maybe it 's chemicals and it may be evolution in real time here 's the bottom line what i think and i didn 't think this when steve gullans and i started writing together i think we 're transitioning into homo evolutis that for better or worse is not just a hominid that 's conscious of his or her environment it 's a hominid that 's beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species of bacteria of plants of animals and i think that 's such an order of magnitude change that your grandkids or your may be a species very different from you thank you very much"
