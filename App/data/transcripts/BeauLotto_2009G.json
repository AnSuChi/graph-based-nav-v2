  "transcript": "and to win this game so we have two panels here of colored dots and one of those dots is the same now i narrowed it down to many people think it 's the orange one let 's find out what the reality is here is the orange one and here is the gray so this is pretty amazing isn 't it because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another so for us seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does and yet even at this most fundamental but why context is everything because it 's but first we have to ask another question which is what is color for and instead of telling you i 'll just show you and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect now can any of you see the predator that 's about to jump out at you and if you haven 't seen it yet you 're dead right but what you 've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible and the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world not only the color and you 'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye this is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real world sources okay and these are two projections from the world they 're identical in every single way identical in shape oriented facing the left viewed through sort of a bluish medium completely different meanings and yet it 's only the retinal information that we get so if you remember anything in this next eighteen minutes remember this that the light that falls onto your eye because it could mean literally anything and what 's true for sensory information is true for information generally there 's no inherent meaning in information it 's what we do with that information that matters so how do we see well we see by learning to see the brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns finding relationships in information and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning a significance by interacting with the world we i 'm going to give you some letter strings and i want you to read them out for me if you can so let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality even at the simplest thing the brain does which is color so if i could have the lights down up here and i want you to stare at that dot don 't look anywhere else we 're going to look at it for about thirty seconds which is a bit of a killer in an you to learn and i 'll tell you don 't look anywhere else i 'll tell you what 's happening in your head your brain is learning and it 's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination the left side of its visual field is under green illumination that 's what it 's learning when i tell you i want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes i take it from your response they don 't look the same anymore right why because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light and the left one is still under green light that 's your new normal okay so what does this mean for context it means i can what 's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter it 's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past and the same thing over on the right but i 'm not going to change anything within those boxes except and see what happens to your perception notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite one very white and one very dark and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions this is one i made a few years ago and you 'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top and a bright orange tile at the side here you see four gray tiles on your left seven gray tiles on the right i and see what happens to your perception the seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray what 's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion so here we and i 'm going to spin it now i want you to keep looking at it yes raise your hand if so i can ask you which direction is it rotating how do you know your brain doesn 't know because both are equally likely so depending on where it looks it flips between the two possibilities even the beautiful with its mere one million brain cells which is two hundred and fifty times fewer cells than you have in one retina sees illusions does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can 't do so in my lab we work on bumblebees because we can completely control their experience and see how it alters the architecture of their brain we do this in what we call the bee matrix here you have the hive you can see the queen bee the large bee in the middle those are her they go back and forth between this hive and the arena via this tube you 'll see one of the bees come out here you see how she has a little number on her there 's another one coming out she also has a number on her we pull them out put them in the fridge and they fall asleep then you can superglue little numbers on them and now in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers then fly and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue but to go where the other bees go so they copy each other they can count to now remember and the answer to the question is no those are actually blue which is exactly what we do illusions are often used especially in art in the words of a more contemporary artist to demonstrate the fragility of our senses okay this is complete rubbish the senses aren 't fragile and if they were we wouldn 't be here color tells us something completely different that the brain didn 't actually evolve to see the world the way it is so how can we take this incredible capacity of of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently well one of the ways we do lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world and they can navigate the world using their ears here 's david on the right and he 's holding a camera on the left is what his camera sees and you 'll see there 's a faint line going across that and now he 's going to turn around close his eyes and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed thinking about and this is a six year old child composing a we 're not defined by our central properties by the bits that make us up we 're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment by our ecology historical and empirical so what i 'd like to finish with is this over here because what i 've been trying to do is really so if we have the lights down and what we have here can everyone see so now what i want to do i 'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them now you can see that changes the light that 's coming through there right because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter i 'm going to do the opposite on the left i 'm going to put the middle nine some of you will have noticed or your left is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on now remember no the question is is that an illusion and i 'll leave you with that so thank you very much"
