  "transcript": "and i returned to the medical university where i studied i saw real patients and i wore the white coat for the first time in seventeen years in fact since i became a management consultant there were two things that surprised me during the month i spent the first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting former friends from medical school who i knew to be some of the smartest most motivated engaged and passionate people i 'd ever met or had distanced themselves from hospital management so with this focus on cost cutting i asked myself are we forgetting the patient many countries that you represent and where i come from struggle with the cost of it 's a big part of the national budgets and many different reforms aim at holding back this growth in some countries we have long waiting times for patients for surgery in other countries new drugs are not being reimbursed and therefore don 't reach patients doctors and nurses are the targets to some extent for the governments after all the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses you choose to operate on an old and frail patient so by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians this is a way to hold costs down so no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated and so we took a step back we 're aiming at improving health for the patients and we need to do so at a limited or affordable cost we call this value based healthcare on the screen behind me you see what we mean by value outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend this was described beautifully in a book in two thousand and six by michael porter and elizabeth teisberg on this we decided not to look so much at the costs but to look at the quality instead and in the research one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw you compare hospitals in a country you 'll find some that are extremely good but you 'll find now living in europe he can choose to go to germany that has a healthcare system if he goes there and goes to the average hospital he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about fifty percent so he would have to start wearing diapers fifty percent risk that 's quite a lot and to a clinic called the martini klinik the risk would be only one in twenty when we look at many hospitals for many different diseases we see these huge there is hope and they were discussing the different procedures they used we probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what 's best so they in fact spent two years debating so what is quality in hip surgery oh and once they had agreed they started measuring very quickly they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in it actually lasted a lot longer re operated on in their lifetime once a year they publish the league table who 's best who 's at the bottom and they visit each other to try to learn so a continuous cycle of improvement for many years swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world at least for those who actually were measuring and many were not now i found this principle really exciting so the physicians get together they agree on what quality is they start measuring now that 's not the only exciting part that 's exciting in itself but if you bring back the cost side of the equation they actually also have the lowest costs although that 's not been the purpose in the first place they looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year we did a study where we looked at oecd data does every so often look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries the actually a quality which is below the average in it would save the american people five hundred billion u s dollars a year that 's twenty percent and i would argue that the agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system in i meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare the one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients physicians are like most of you in the audience very competitive we were always best in class and if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no they actually thrive from peer recognition they will share the information on how to improve we 're creating a global be able to measure and compare what we achieve together with two academic institutions bcg has formed something we call ichom but it 's not a sneeze it 's an acronym it stands for the international consortium we 're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss disease by disease what is really quality what should we measure and to make those standards global heart attack and prostate cancer the four groups will publish their data in november of this year the year after sixteen in three years ' time we plan to have covered forty percent of the disease burden apples to apples who 's better why is that five months ago and she has a vision i want to manage my big institution much more we sat in in a workshop together with physicians nurses and other staff discussing leukemia in children the group discussed how do we measure quality today can we measure it better than we do we discussed how do we treat these kids what are important improvements there was an enormous energy in the room there were so many ideas so much enthusiasm the chairman of the department he stood up he looked over the group and he said clenched his fist and then he said to the group we 're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution i believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution and i 'm convinced thank you"
