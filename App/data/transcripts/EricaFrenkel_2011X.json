  "transcript": "i 'm going to talk to you today about the design of medical technology for almost across the board is access to safe and the safety of those surgeries that do happen is anesthesia and actually it 's the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments here we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the us or any other developed country in the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia it needs an extremely it 's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms and it needs special care it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities can fix it can source the parts and keep it saving lives it 's a pretty expensive machine it needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of fifty one hundred thousand and perhaps most obviously but also most importantly and the path to concepts that we 've heard about kind of illustrates this it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity of compressed oxygen and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning this is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural malawi in this hospital there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia and she 's qualified because she has twelve maybe eighteen months of training in anesthesia in the hospital and in the entire region there 's not a single biomedical engineer so when this machine breaks the machines that they have to work with break they 've got to try and figure it out but most of the time that 's the end of the road those machines go the proverbial and the price tag of the machine that i mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital and finally i think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong this hospital is connected to a very weak power grid one that goes down frequently so it runs frequently the entire hospital just on a generator and you can imagine the generator breaks down or runs out of fuel and the world bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low income country can expect up to eighteen power outages per month so it seems crazy but the model we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that i showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment it 's not just inappropriate it becomes really unsafe one of our partners at johns hopkins was observing and the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical and everything began pretty auspiciously the surgeon was on call and scrubbed in and everything began well until the power went out and now in the middle of this surgery the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case which he can do he 's got a headlamp but the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient to keep her patient asleep because her machine doesn 't work when there 's no power and what 's so frustrating is this is not a singular event this happens across the my colleague dr paul fenton was living this reality he was the chief of anesthesiology in a hospital in malawi a teaching hospital he went to work every day in an operating theater like this one trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable and frankly unsafe in his hospital and after umpteen surgeries and you can imagine really unspeakable tragedy he just said that 's it i 'm done that 's enough there has to be something better he took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them i think that 's the scientific term and he started tinkering he took one part from here and another from there and he tried to come up with a machine that would work in the reality that he was facing the prototype for the universal anesthesia machine here it is back at home at that same hospital developed a little further twelve years later working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics let me show you a little bit about how this machine works everything in this machine begins essentially to deliver anesthesia you want as pure oxygen as possible because eventually you 're going to dilute with the gas and but so in here when there 's electricity the oxygen concentrator takes in room air now we know room air is gloriously free it is abundant and it 's already twenty one percent oxygen so all this concentrator does is take that room air in filter it and send ninety five percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent now before that mixture hits the patient 's lungs it 's going to pass by here you can 't see it but there 's an oxygen sensor here that 's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered now if you don 't have this machine transitions automatically without even having to touch it to drawing in room air from this inlet everything else is the same the only difference is that now you 're only working with twenty one percent oxygen now that used to be a dangerous guessing game because you only knew if you gave too little oxygen once something bad happened but we 've put a long life battery backup on here this is the only part that 's battery backed up but this gives control to the provider whether there 's power or not because they can adjust the flows based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they 're giving the patient in both cases whether you have power and so we 've just added this manual bellows we 've seen surgeries for three or four hours to ventilate the patient on this so it 's a straightforward machine i shudder to say simple it 's straightforward and it 's by design you do not need to be a highly trained specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine which is good because in these rural district hospitals you 're not going to get that level of training it 's also designed for the environment that it will be used in this is an incredibly rugged machine it has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts and so it 's affordable this machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that i showed you earlier so in other words what we have here is a machine can enable surgery and save lives because it was designed for its environment just like the first machine i showed you and since two thousand and so we 're thrilled this really seems like a but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals so to do that we 've launched a number of partnerships with ngos and universities to gather data on the user interface on the types of surgeries it 's appropriate for and ways we can enhance the device itself one of those partnerships is with johns hopkins just here in baltimore they have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in baltimore so we 're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it 's intended for and in a contained safe environment evaluating its effectiveness we 're then able to compare the results from that study so i 've talked a lot about anesthesia and i tend to do that i think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health and it really seems peripheral we never think about it until we don 't have access to it and then it becomes a gatekeeper who gets surgery and who doesn 't who gets safe surgery and who doesn 't but you know it 's just one of so many ways that design appropriate design can have an impact on health outcomes low income countries could start their design process their solution search from outside of that proverbial box and inside of the hospital in other words if we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world rather than the one that we wished existed thank you very much"
