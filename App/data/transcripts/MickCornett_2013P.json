  "transcript": "most of you let me give you a little bit of background oklahoma city started in the most unique way imaginable back on a spring day in one thousand eight hundred and eighty nine the federal government held what they called a land run the population of oklahoma city had gone from zero to ten thousand and our planning department is still paying for that and then they shot him that 's not really all that funny but it allows me to see what type of audience i 'm dealing with so i appreciate the feedback 20th century was fairly kind to oklahoma city our economy was based on commodities so the price of cotton or the price of wheat and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas the shopping cart was you 're welcome having an economy though that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs and that was certainly the case in oklahoma city 's history and then in the early 1980s it cratered quickly our banks began to fail before the end of the decade one hundred banks had failed in the state of oklahoma our commercial real estate industry were all but along at the end of the ' 80s came an enterprising businessman who became mayor named ron norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development wasn 't incentivizing companies up front it was about creating a place where businesses to locate and so he pushed an initiative called maps that basically was a penny on the dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff it built a new sports arena a new canal downtown it fixed up our performing arts center a new baseball stadium downtown a lot of things to improve the quality of life and the economy indeed seemed to start showing some signs of life the next mayor came along and then in two thousand and four in this rare collective lack of judgment bordering on civil disobedience the citizens elected me mayor now the city i inherited and for the very first time we started showing up on the lists now you know the lists i 'm talking about the media and the internet love to rank cities and in oklahoma never really been on lists before best downtown and then came the list of the most obese cities in the country there we were now i like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places dallas and houston and new orleans and atlanta and miami you know these are cities that typically you 're not embarrassed to be associated with i didn 't like being on the list i got on the scales and i typed in my height i typed in my weight and it came back and said obese and i noticed this pattern and i could only wear a third of it at any one time i finally decided i needed to lose weight and i knew i could because i 'd done it so many times before so i simply stopped eating as much i had always exercised that really wasn 't the part of the equation that i needed to work on but i had been eating three thousand calories a day and i cut it to two thousand calories a day and the weight came off i lost about a pound a week for about forty weeks trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity and i came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car laughter but if you happen to be a person you are combatting the car seemingly at every no traffic congestion in oklahoma city to speak of six hundred and twenty square miles but fifteen miles is less than fifteen minutes and as a result people tend to spread out land 's cheap we had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments for a long long time we had fixed that but it had been relatively recently and there were literally one hundred thousand or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had virtually no level of walkability how we might deal with obesity and was taking all of these elements into my mind i decided that the first thing we need to do and so and i said and we 're going to lose a million pounds well that 's when all hell broke loose and they really could have gone with it one of two ways they could have said this city is so fat that the mayor had to put them on a diet the consensus was look this is a problem in a lot of places this is a city that 's wanting to do something about it now the web address was and so the pounds started to add up and the conversation that i thought was so important to have was starting to take place it was taking place inside the it was taking place in churches and the large companies they typically have wonderful wellness programs but the medium sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others and then came the next stage of the equation it was time to push what i called maps three now maps three like the other two programs had had an economic development motive behind it we 're building a downtown streetcar to try and help the walkability formula for people who choose to live in the inner city and help us create the density there and wellness centers throughout the community we hosted the olympic trials last spring we have olympic caliber events coming to athletes from all over the world moving in we also with another initiative that was passed are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks throughout the metro area we 're even going back into some inner city situations where we had built neighborhoods and we had built schools but we had not connected the two we 're completing our bicycle trail master plan we 'll have over one hundred miles when we 're and lo and behold the demographic highly educated twentysomethings are moving to oklahoma city from all over the region and indeed even from further away in california i flew to new york with some and then that afternoon i did a round of media in new york pushing and i went into the lobby of men 's fitness magazine the same magazine that had put us on that list and i pick it up and i look at the headline across the top and it says america 's fattest cities do you live in one and we weren 't on it and we were on that list we have a long way to go health is still not something that we should be proud of in oklahoma city but we seem to have turned the cultural shift and if you 're like me at some point in your educational career you were asked to read a book called the grapes of wrath oklahomans leaving for california in large numbers for a better future when we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west it appears that what we 're seeing now is the wrath of grapes the grandchildren are coming home you 've been a great audience and very attentive thank you very much for having"
