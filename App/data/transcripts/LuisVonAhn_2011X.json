  "transcript": "had to fill out some sort of web form where you 've been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this how many of you found it really really annoying okay outstanding so i invented that or and the reason it is there is to make sure you the entity filling out the form are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times the reason it works is because humans at least non visually impaired humans have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters whereas computer programs simply can 't do it as well yet the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions two at a time so this is an example from the yahoo registration page the random characters that happened to be shown to the user were w a i t which of course spell a word but the best part is the captcha project is something that we did here at carnegie melllon over ten years ago and it 's been used everywhere and then about a year and a half so let me tell you what this project started so this project started from the following realization it turns out that approximately two hundred million captchas are typed everyday by people around the world but then i started feeling bad see here 's the thing each time you type a so then i started feeling bad but then i started thinking is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity so see here 's the thing while you 're typing a captcha during those ten seconds your brain is doing something amazing your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do so can we get you to do useful work for those ten seconds another way of putting it is is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve yet we can split into tiny 10 second chunks so what you may not know is that nowadays while you 're typing a captcha not only are you authenticating yourself as a human to digitize books google has one the internet archive has one amazon now with the kindle is trying to digitize books basically the way this works is you start with an old book you 've seen those things right like a book so and then you scan it scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book it gives you an image for every page of the book this is an image with text for every page of the book the next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image that 's using a technology called ocr for optical character recognition which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there ocr is not perfect especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow ocr cannot recognize a lot of the words for example so what we 're doing now is we 're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we 're getting people to read them for us while they 're typing a captcha on the internet so the next time you type a captcha these words that you 're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize it cannot grade it for you so what we do is we give you another word one for which the system does know the answer and if we repeat this process to like ten different people and all so this is how the system works and basically since we released it about three or four years ago a lot of websites have started switching from you help to digitize a book twitter and about three hundred and fifty thousand which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year and this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing captchas on the internet we 're doing so many words per day funny things can happen and this is especially true because now we 're giving people two randomly chosen english words next to each other bad things can happen showed this actually happened to be called the embassy of the kingdom of god oops laughter here 's another really bad one since we 're presenting two randomly chosen words interesting things can happen so this actually has given rise to here 's how it works imagine you 're using the internet and you see a captcha that you think is somewhat but then first you take a screen shot and then you draw something that is related to it there are tens of thousands of these some of them are very cute and some of them like paleontological shvisle they contain snoop dogg so this is the favorite thing that i like about this whole project seven hundred and fifty million and it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda so the question that motivates my research is the following building the pyramids of egypt or the panama canal or putting a man on the moon there is a curious fact about them they were all done with about one hundred thousand people coordinating more than one hundred thousand people let alone paying them so the question that motivates my research is if we can put a man on the moon with one hundred thousand what can we do with one hundred million so based on this question we 've had a lot of different projects that we 've been working on let me tell you about one that i 'm most excited about this is something that we 've been since it hasn 't been launched shhhhh yeah i can trust you 'll okay that 's severin hacker so i posed this question to him how can we get one hundred million people translating the web into every major language for free okay so there 's a lot of things to say about this question first of all translating or at least most of the web into every major language so well the problem with that is that it since it makes so many mistakes you don 't know whether to trust it or not it was translated from japanese 'll just let you read this person starts apologizing for the fact that it 's remember it 's a question about javascript and then comes the ending which is my favorite part of the whole thing we could do that spanish but it 's very small compared to the size of english it 's about twenty percent of the size of english we wanted to translate the other eighty percent it would cost at least fifty million dollars and this is at even the most exploited outsourcing country out there so it would be very expensive so what we want to do is we want to get one hundred million people translating the web into every major language for free now if this is what you want to do you pretty quickly realize you 're going to run into two pretty big the first one is a lack of bilinguals so i don 't even know if there exists one hundred million people out there using the web who are bilingual enough to help us translate that 's a big problem the other problem you 're going to run into is a lack of motivation now when we were starting to think about this we were blocked by these two things but then we realized there 's actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution there 's a way to kill two birds with one stone and that is language education people really really want to learn a foreign language and it 's not just because they 're being so we give you very very simple sentences along with what each word means and as you translate them and as you see how other people translate them you start learning the language and as you as you get more and more advanced we give you more and more complex sentences to translate but at all times you 're learning by doing now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works first of all people are really really learning a language we 're mostly done building it and now we 're testing it people really can learn a language with it but actually it 's way more interesting because you see with duolingo people are actually learning with real content as opposed to learning with made up sentences people are learning with real content which is inherently interesting even though they 're just beginners the top is the german the middle is an english translation that was done by somebody who was a professional english translator who we paid twenty cents a word for this translation and the bottom is a translation by users of duolingo of whom knew any german before they started using the site you now of course we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators we combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator now even though we 're combining the translations remember this is fifty million dollars worth of value and we could do it in about eighty hours with a million active users since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users we 're hopeful that we 'll be able to translate extremely fast so here 's the thing the current business model for language education is the student pays and in particular the student pays rosetta stone five hundred dollars that 's so because while you learn you 're actually creating value so this is how we could monetize this since people are creating value while they 're learning they don 't have to pay their money they pay with their time but the magical thing here is that they 're paying with their time but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language so the nice thing about duolingo is i think it provides a fair business model one that doesn 't discriminate against poor people so here 's the site thank you applause so here 's the site we haven 't yet launched you can sign up to be part of our private beta which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks we haven 't yet launched this duolingo by the way talking here but actually duolingo is the work of a really awesome team some of whom are here so thank you"
