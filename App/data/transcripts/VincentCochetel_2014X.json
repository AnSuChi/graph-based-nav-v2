  "transcript": "their names were aslan the list is longer has been reduced to coldly recorded as security incidents for me they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers tried to bring a bit of comfort to the victims of the wars in chechnya in the ' 90s interpreters they were murdered their families torn apart they live in me somehow as humanitarian aid workers they made the choice to be at the side of the victim to provide some assistance some comfort some protection it hostage executed how did we become so indifferent to these crimes we also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives we also need to demand justice when in ' ninety six i was sent by the united nations high commissioner for refugees to the north caucasus i knew some of the yet on a cold winter night of january blindfolded when it happens to you there is no time for thinking no time for praying but had ordered my kidnapping i was kept in an underground and then the guards would come normally two they would bring a big piece of bread a bowl of soup and a candle fifteen minutes of precious light and then they would take i could do only four small steps i always dreamt of the fifth one and no tv no radio no newspaper no one to talk to no toilet paper just two metal buckets open one for water one waste can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe how do you describe nothing there are no words for the depths of loneliness i reached in that very thin border between sanity and madness in the darkness sometimes i played i would start with the black play with the white back to the black trying to trick the other side i don 't play checkers anymore i was tormented by the thoughts of my family and my colleague the guard edik i didn 't know what had happened to him i i tried to pray i tried all sorts of memorization games but darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal one part of your brain wants you to resist to shout to cry and the other part of the brain orders you to once a guard came to me very aggressively and he told me today you 're going to kneel and beg for your food i insulted his mother i insulted his ancestors the consequence was moderate he threw the food into my waste the day after he came back with the same demand which had four days later the body was full of pain i didn 't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little so when the guards came down i begged for my food the only way for me to make it to another candle after my kidnapping i was transferred from north ossetia to chechnya and upon arrival i was interrogated for eleven days by a guy called ruslan the routine was always the same a bit more light he would beat me i 'll spare you the details there are many questions i could not understand and there are some questions i did not want to understand i would always long for the last song i don 't know what it was i heard a child crying above my head people running he was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life i kept talking about ngos supplying medicines to local clinics that may help his son to get better and we talked about we talked about families i talked to him about my daughters and then he 'd talk about guns about cars about women and i had to talk about guns about cars about women ruslan was the most brutal man i ever met two very close it was quite unusual and he said with a very soft like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby dagestan it took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier he made me question everything we did until then i had assumed that they know why we are there and what we are doing one cannot assume this we sometimes that 's the only difference you make one individual one family a small group of individuals when you have a tsunami an earthquake or a typhoon you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the searching for survivors for weeks why nobody questions this every life matters or every life should matter i know many people when they are confronted by we have to we can 't do otherwise it 's what makes us feel i don 't know simply human months after my release i met the then french prime minister the second thing he told me you were totally irresponsible to go to the north caucasus you don 't know how many problems you 've created for us it was a short meeting i think helping people in danger is responsible in that war it was making a real difference for the people why could he not understand this we have a responsibility to try you 've heard about that concept responsibility to protect outcomes may depend on various parameters we may even fail but there is worse than failing it 's not even trying when we can well if you are met this way if you sign up for this sort of job your life is going to be full of joy and sadness because there are a lot of people we cannot help a lot of people we cannot protect a lot of people we i call them my ghost and by having witnessed their suffering from close you take a bit of that suffering on yourself but they are powerless to bring any change they have to learn to accept it but for those who do there is no other job like this you can see the difference you make every day humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in the sanctity of our life is fading do you know that since the millennium the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers has tripled two thousand and until the beginning of the civil war in somalia in the late ' 80s humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims of what we call collateral damages but by and large we were not the target of these attacks gone are the days when a u n blue flag criminal groups and some over the last twenty years and they 've created these sort of hybrids with whom we have no way of communicating we have abandoned the search for justice there seems to be no consequence whatsoever for attacks against humanitarian but this was the exception there was the same all over the world this is unacceptable this is inexcusable we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself that makes me furious i know i 'm very lucky i don 't know what it is to lose the protection of my country four days before my eventful four hostages were beheaded why am i here today no easy answer i was received with a lot of support that i got from my relatives from colleagues from friends from people i didn 't know they have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness not everyone was treated with the same attention how many of my colleagues after a traumatic incident own life how many of my difficult divorce after a traumatic experience because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse i 've lost that count there is a price for this type of life in russia all no one is forgotten nothing is forgotten i call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better we should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off why do you have to go back to it if i had quit they would have taken my soul and my humanity"
