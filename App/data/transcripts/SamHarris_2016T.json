  "transcript": "a failure of intuition that many of us suffer from it 's really a failure to detect a certain kind of danger i 'm going to describe a scenario that i think is both and yet rather than be scared most of you will feel that what i 'm talking about is kind of cool i 'm going to describe how the gains we make in artificial intelligence could ultimately destroy us and in fact i think it 's very difficult to see how they won 't destroy us and yet if you 're find that it 's fun to think about these things and that that response is part of the problem ok that response should worry you and if i were to convince you in this talk and that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are very likely to live like this i like this ted talk and one of the things that worries me most about the development of ai at this point is that we seem unable to marshal an appropriate emotional response to the dangers that lie ahead i am unable to marshal this response and i 'm giving this talk it 's as though we stand before two doors now take a moment to consider why this might happen i mean we will continue to improve our technology if we are at all able to what could stop us from doing this a global pandemic an asteroid impact justin bieber becoming president of the united states laughter the point is something would have to destroy civilization as we know it you have to imagine how bad it would have to be to prevent us from making improvements in our technology permanently generation after generation almost by definition this is the worst thing that 's ever happened in human history and this is what lies behind door number two is that we continue to improve our intelligent machines we will build machines that are smarter than we are and once we have machines that are smarter than we are and then we risk what the mathematician ij good called an intelligence explosion that the process could get away from us now this is often caricatured as i have here as a fear that armies of malicious robots will attack us but that isn 't the most likely scenario not that our machines will become spontaneously malevolent the concern is really that we will build machines that are so much more competent than we are that the slightest divergence between their goals and our own could destroy us just think about how we relate to ants but whenever their presence seriously conflicts the concern is that we will one day build machines that whether they 're conscious or not could treat us with similar disregard now i suspect this seems far fetched to many of you i bet there are those of you who doubt that and there are only three of them intelligence is a matter of information processing in physical systems actually this is a little bit more than an assumption we have already built narrow intelligence into our and we know that mere matter because our brains have managed it right i there 's just atoms in here and as long as we continue to we will eventually unless we are interrupted we will eventually it 's crucial to realize that that the rate of progress doesn 't matter because any progress is enough to get us into the end zone we don 't need moore 's law to continue we don 't need exponential progress we will continue and given the value of intelligence i mean intelligence is either the source of everything we value we want to cure diseases like alzheimer 's and cancer so we will do this if we can the train is already out of the station and there 's no brake to pull we don 't stand on a peak of intelligence and this is what what makes our intuitions about risk so unreliable now just consider the smartest person who has ever lived on almost everyone 's shortlist here is john von neumann i and this included the greatest mathematicians and physicists of his time is fairly so consider the spectrum of intelligence here we have john von neumann and then we have a chicken sorry a chicken there 's no reason for me to make this talk more depressing than it needs to and if we build machines that are more intelligent than we are they will very likely explore this spectrum in ways that we can 't imagine and exceed us in ways that we can 't imagine and it 's important to recognize that this is true by virtue of speed electronic circuits function about a million times faster than biochemical ones so this machine should think about a million times faster than the minds that built it and it will perform twenty thousand years of human level intellectual work week after week after week week how could we even understand much less constrain a mind making this sort of progress the other thing that 's worrying frankly is so imagine we we hit upon a design of superintelligent ai that has no safety concerns we have the perfect design the first time around powered by sunlight more or less for the cost of raw materials so what would apes well we 'd be free to play frisbee and give each other massages add some lsd and some questionable wardrobe choices and the whole world could be like burning man it seems likely that we would witness a level of wealth inequality and unemployment that we have never seen before absent a willingness to immediately put this new wealth to the service of all humanity and what would the russians or the chinese do if they heard that some company in silicon valley was about to whether terrestrial or cyber with unprecedented power this is a winner take all scenario to be six months ahead of the competition here is to be five hundred thousand years ahead at a minimum so it seems even mere rumors of this kind of breakthrough could cause our species to go berserk now one of the most frightening things in my view at this moment are the kinds of things that ai researchers say and the most common reason we 're told not to worry is time this is all a long way off don 't you know this is probably fifty or one hundred years away one researcher has said worrying about ai safety is like worrying about overpopulation on mars this is the silicon valley version of don 't worry your pretty little head about it laughter no one seems to notice that referencing the time horizon is a total non sequitur we will produce some form of superintelligence and we have no idea how long it will take us to create the conditions to do that safely let we have no idea this is how long we 've had the fifty years is not that much time to meet one of the greatest challenges our species will ever face we seem to be failing to have an appropriate emotional response to what we have every reason to believe is coming the computer scientist stuart russell has a nice analogy here he said imagine that we received a message from an alien civilization which read we will arrive on your planet in fifty years get ready we would feel a little more urgency than we do another reason we 're told not to worry is that these machines can 't help but share our values because they will be literally extensions of ourselves they 'll be grafted onto our brains and we 'll essentially become their limbic systems now take a moment to consider that the safest and only prudent path forward recommended is to implant this technology directly into our brains now this may in fact be the safest and only prudent path forward but usually one 's safety concerns about a technology have to be pretty much worked out before you stick it inside your head the deeper problem is that superintelligent ai on its own seems likely to be easier than building superintelligent ai and having the completed neuroscience that allows us to seamlessly integrate our minds with it and given that the companies and governments doing this work are likely to perceive themselves as being in a race against all others that to win this race is to win the world provided you don 't destroy it in the next moment then it seems likely that whatever is easier to do will get done first now unfortunately i don 't have a solution to this problem apart from recommending that more of us think about it i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence not to build it because i think we 'll inevitably do that but to to understand how to avoid an arms race and to build it in a way that is aligned with our interests when you 're talking about superintelligent ai that can make changes to itself but the moment we admit that information processing is the source of intelligence that some appropriate computational system is what and we admit that the horizon of cognition very likely far exceeds what we currently know then we have to admit that we are in the process of building some sort of god now would be a good time to make sure it 's a god we can live with thank you very much"
