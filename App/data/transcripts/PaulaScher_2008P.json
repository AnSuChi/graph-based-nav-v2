  "transcript": "and i play when i design i even looked it up in the dictionary to make sure that i actually do that and the definition of play number one was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor and number two was gambling realize i do both when i 'm designing i 'm and i think that if you 're not there 's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you 're in if you 're a designer but the serious part is what threw me and i couldn 't quite get a handle and it 's an essay i read thirty and i 'm going to read you this essay or an excerpt from it because it it really hit home for me being solemn is easy being serious is hard the rare candidate who is serious like adlai stevenson is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn like eisenhower washington d c is solemn new york is serious going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the taking a long walk by yourself during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing tiffany 's is serious now when i apply russell baker 's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design it doesn 't necessarily make any particular point about quality and is accepted by appropriate designers and all the clients are striving for serious design serious play is something else accidentally or incidentally it can be achieved out of innocence or arrogance or out of selfishness sometimes out of carelessness but mostly it 's achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don 't really make any sense serious design imperfect it 's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind serious design is also often quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view if you look at the staircase you 'll see that in your 20s the risers are very high and the steps are very short and you make huge discoveries you sort of the risers get shallower and the steps get wider and as you get older and more decrepit you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase leading you into oblivion i 'm hired to be but i find more and more that i 'm solemn when i don 't have to be designing record covers for cbs records and i had no idea what a great job i had i thought everybody had a job like that and what way i looked at design and the way i looked at the world was what was going on around me and the things that came at the time i walked into design were the enemy i thought the typeface helvetica was the cleanest most boring most fascistic really repressive typeface and i hated everything that was designed in helvetica when i was in my college days this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular this is actually quite a lovely book jacket by rudy de harak but i just hated it because it was designed with helvetica and i made parodies about it i just thought it was you know completely boring and what i responded to was you know and i taught myself design this way and this was sort of my early years and i used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design i wasn 't educated i just sort of put these things together i mixed up victorian very elaborate record covers not because i was being a or a historicist because i didn 't know what those things were i just hated helvetica and that kind of passion a kind of play i could never do now because i 'm too well educated and there 's something wonderful about and be and then accomplish things by the end of the ' 70s actually the stuff became known i mean these covers appeared all over the world and they started winning awards and people knew and i was suddenly a turning out these sorts of designs that i was expected to do because that 's who i was and i was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead and getting rediscovered all over again so here was the second condition for which i but it 's a beaut and in the movie he plays and he 's and in the depth of despair in the midst of the movie when it looks like he can 't pull this thing off and he needs this case he needs to win this case so badly there this is the case there are no other cases and in that moment moment of desire and focus and i had that moment in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four when i met a theater director named george wolfe who was going to have me and i began getting this is what was in the newspapers and in the new york times so this is sort of a comment on the time and the public theater actually had much better advertising than this they had no logo and no identity but they had these very iconic posters painted by paul davis and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive so drawing on my love of typography i immersed myself into this project and what was different about it was the totality of it was that i really became the voice the visual voice of a place in a way i had never done before where every aspect the smallest ad the ticket whatever it was was designed by me there was no format there was no in house department that these things were pushed to i literally for three years made everything and it was the only job even though i was doing other jobs i lived and breathed it in a way i haven 't with a client since but when you get it and you have this opportunity it 's the moment of serious play and the high point of the public two years after i designed it which was the bring in ' da noise bring in ' da funk campaign that was all over new york ate my identity because people began to copy it here 's an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called mind games which meant i had to change it and i continued to do these but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual and they didn 't have that heft of everything being the same thing now and i think and i don 't think i ever i ever grasped that seriousness again i do them for very big important institutions in new york the best way to accomplish serious design which i think we all have the opportunity to do is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job that doesn 't happen very often but it happened to me in the year two thousand when for some reason or another a whole pile of different architects to ask me to design where i would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings i 'd never done this kind of work before i didn 't know how to read and i really couldn 't handle the fact that a job a single job could go on for four years because i was used to immediacy in graphic design and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me but i fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture 90th street and broadway and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics extruded typography that 's backlit with neon things i never did before i think my favorite of these was this little job in newark new jersey it 's a if we give you one hundred thousand dollars what can you do with it and and we did i hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building and they loved it they got into it they took the job incredibly seriously they used to climb up on the building call me and tell me that they had to correct my typography that my spacing was wrong and they moved it and they did wonderful things with it they were pretty serious too it was quite wonderful by the time i i did bloomberg 's headquarters and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular this is a current project where i got to be goofy i was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood called the north side so i had to actually give a presentation to to a city council and neighborhood constituents and i went to pittsburgh and i said you know really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town don 't you celebrate them and make the underpasses landmarks so i began doing this crazy presentation of these installations potential installations on but i was so utterly unqualified for this project and so utterly ridiculous and ignored the brief so desperately that i think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness just completely because it was so goofy to begin with and this is the bridge they 're actually painting up and preparing as we speak it will change every six months and it will become an art installation in the north side of john hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with citibank that is now a 10 year relationship and i still work with them and i actually am amused by them and like them and think that as a very very very very very big corporation they actually and then i spent trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the to the point of tears i thought i was going to go crazy at the end of this year we made idiotic presentations showing how the citi logo made sense and how it was really derived from an umbrella and we made animations of these things and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and but for me it was actually a very very depressing year as a matter of fact they actually never bought onto the logo until fallon put it on its very good live richly campaign and then everybody accepted it all and i was up in my country house and for some reason i began painting these very big very involved laborious complicated maps and going and cooper hewitt and people walked up to it and they would point to a part of the map and they 'd say oh i 've been here and i was totally and completely at play one of my favorites was this painting i did of florida after the two thousand election that has the election results rolling around in the water i keep that for evidence and i had a first show about two and a half years ago and i showed these paintings that that i 'm showing you now and then a funny thing happened they sold and they they sold quickly and this is manhattan and they started selling too so the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years which meant that i really had to paint these paintings much faster than i had ever done them and i they started to become more political and i and i began doing these things and then this funny thing happened i found that i was no longer at play i was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show which is not where i started and that 's a terrifying factor when you start something and it turns that way because it means that all that 's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can invent that you can be ignorant about that you can be arrogant about and that you can be a fool with because in the end that 's how you grow and that 's all that matters"
