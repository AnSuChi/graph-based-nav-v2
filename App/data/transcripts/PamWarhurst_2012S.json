  "transcript": "to live life differently can start in some of the most unusual places this is where i fairly normal market town we call it propaganda gardening corner row railway station car park front of a health center people 's front gardens and even in front of the police station and we 've got sprouting cemeteries the soil is extremely good and believe it or not people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds even when there 's not much growing but it starts a conversation 're not doing it because we 're bored we 're doing it we tried to answer this simple question can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living think about the resources they use differently can we replicate those actions and the language would appear to be food so three and a half years ago a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing we came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting we did not consult we did not write a report enough of all that let 's imagine that our town is focused around three plates a community plate the way we live our everyday lives a learning plate what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support now let 's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food and then and we 've done it all without a flipping strategy document we 've not asked anybody 's permission to do this we 're just doing it and we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start and most importantly of all we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say these small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow 's problems because i have seen the power of small actions and it is awesome so back to the public meeting and it 's been the same in every single room in every town that we 've ever told our story people are ready and respond to the story of food they want positive actions they can engage in and in their bones and since we had that meeting three and a half years ago it 's been a heck of a and we turned it into a and we made vegetable beds for everybody to share and pick from themselves it has been surrounded by prickly plants so we went to the doctors said would you mind us taking them up they said absolutely fine provided you get planning permission and you do it in latin and you do it in triplicate so we did and now there are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and vegetables around but it isn 't just about growing because we all are part of this jigsaw it 's about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what 's growing there because there 's so many people that don 't really recognize a vegetable unless it 's in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on designed these things if it looks like this please don 't pick it but if it looks like this help yourself this is about sharing and investing in kindness or in the pub or in the church or wherever people are living their lives this is about us going to the people we are all part of the local food jigsaw we are all part of a solution and then because we know we 've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they 're absolutely fantastic we thought what could we do to give them an even better experience so we invented without asking of course the incredible edible green route and edible towpaths and and it 's a route that we designed that takes people through the whole of our town past our cafes and our small shops through our market and then there 's the second plate we are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school like you do and because the community was really keen on working with the high school the high school is now teaching how can we give them some more experience it was really quite muddy but in a truly incredible way totally voluntary led and because we were doing that some local academics said you know we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you because if you walk through an edible landscape and if you 're learning new skills and if you start to get interested in what 's growing seasonally you might just want to spend more of your own money in support of local producers but then we 're just a community group and they scribbled on and then we had a chat with the farmers and we said we 're really serious about this but okay so we launched a campaign because it just amuses me called every egg matters and what we did was we put people on our egg map it 's a stylized map of togmorden and we 've now got sixty four on and the result of that was that people were then going into shops asking for a local todmorden egg and the result of that was some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds and then they went on to meat birds and although these are really really small steps that increasing local economic confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways and we now have farmers doing cheese and they 've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs they 're doing pasties and pies and things that they would have never done before we 've got increasing market stalls selling local food and in a survey that local students did for us forty nine percent of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing and we 're just volunteers and it 's only an experiment but it is joined and it is inclusive if you eat you 're in 's been really quite a roller coaster experience but going back to that first question that we asked is whichever way they want to do it of their own volition they 're trying to make their own lives differently and worldwide we 've got communities across america and japan it 's incredible america and japan and new zealand people after the earthquake in new zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of christchurch and none of this takes more money but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that and there 's some great ideas already in our patch our local authority has decided to make everywhere and then they 've said to every and help them to maintain their spaces and there 's lots more you could do i mean just to list a few one please stop putting prickly plants around public buildings it 's a waste of space please create edible landscapes so that our children start to walk past their food day in day out on our high streets in our parks wherever that might be inspire local planners to put the if we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow then please let us say to every school create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment local food and soils put that at the heart of your school culture and you will create a different generation the power of small actions"
