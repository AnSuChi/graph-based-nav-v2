  "transcript": "falling inexorably towards each other three suns ' worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second it was a very all that energy was pumped making the universe explode in gravitational waves let me give you a sense of the timescale earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life people and even god save us the internet and about twenty five years ago kip thorne and ronald drever at caltech decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes most people thought they were nuts so construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work they built their detector the laser interferometer observatory it 's now called advanced ligo as a result in early september of two thousand and on september fourteen just days after the detector had gone live the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the earth and they passed through you and me and they passed through the detector the other is when i had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill everything i 'd been working on it 's no longer science fiction allan so that 's my very good friend and collaborator scott hughes a theoretical physicist at mit who so let me take a moment to tell you what i mean by a gravitational wave a gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time as the wave passes by stretches space and everything in it in one direction and compresses it in the other this has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity it stretches and expands it stretches and expands for example the waves that hit every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave when the waves hit they stretched the average person by one part in ten to the twenty one that 's a decimal place twenty zeroes and a one that 's why everyone thought the ligo people were nuts even with a laser detector five kilometers long and that 's already crazy they would have to measure the length of those detectors so towards the end of his classic text on gravity the hunt for gravitational waves as follows he said the technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors but physicists are ingenious and with the support of a broad lay public all obstacles will surely be overcome coming back to ligo scott likes to say that ligo acts like visible light has a wavelength a size that 's much smaller than the things around you the features on people 's and that 's really useful because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you sound is different audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to fifty feet long and that makes it really difficult in fact in practical purposes impossible to make an image of something you really care about your child 's we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds that 's alice talking that 's bob interrupting silly bob but by listening to changes in the the frequencies that it can hear so if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air into sound we can literally hear the universe speaking to us listening to gravity something my colleague scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about sh if the two black holes are non spinning you get a very simple chirp whoop but with a modulation on top of it so it kind of goes it 's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform so on september fourteen two thousand and fifteen a date that 's definitely going to live in my memory ligo heard this [ whirring sound ] so if you know how to listen that is the sound of sh two black holes each of about thirty solar masses that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender aa it 's worth pausing here to think about what that means twenty nine suns and one with a mass of thirty six suns whirling around each other one hundred times per second before they collide just imagine the power of that it and we know it because we heard it that 's the lasting importance of ligo it it 's a way that lets us hear the universe and hear the invisible so supernova the problem is all the interesting physics happens in the core and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon we 'll never see through it it 's opaque to light gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass i would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the universe because i 'm positive that there are things out there that we 've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven 't even imagined ligo found things addressing exactly that so it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what 's out there in the universe and how the stars came to be our job is to dream up and build new observatories a whole new generation of observatories on the ground in space i mean dream with us thank you"
