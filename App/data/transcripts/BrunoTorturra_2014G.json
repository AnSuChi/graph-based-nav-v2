  "transcript": "tear gas anyone i 'm sorry to hear that so you might know that it 's a very toxic substance but you might not know that it 's a very simple molecule with an unpronouncable name it 's called i made it it but it 's becoming very trendy among police forces around the planet lately it seems and according to my experience as a non voluntary breather of it it can really burn your eyes and two it can also help you to open them tear gas definitely helped to open mine to something that i want to share with you this afternoon that the power of independent broadcasts through the web can be and as i see it in the political that idea started to dawn on me in early two thousand and eleven when i was it was the marijuana march a gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis and then the gas but to make a long story short i had entered that protest as the i left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways of sharing the raw experience of what like to i was back in the streets i was there as an independent livestreamer i had a very simple camera that could be shared through social media could be put in any website and that time the protest went along fine there was no violence there was no action scenes but there was something really exciting because i could see at a distance the tv channels covering because and i got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me basically how did i do it how it was possible to do such a thing and i learned something else that that was actually the first time that somebody had ever done a livestreaming in a street and all the equipment needed was already there was easily available and i realized that we had a frontier here a very important one that it was just a matter of changing the perspective and anyone with very basic i started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways not only in the streets but mostly in studios and ninja is an acronym that stands for we were not planning to make money out of this which was wise because you shouldn 't try to make money out of journalism now but we had a very solid and clear conviction that we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media could maybe allow us to consolidate a network of experimental journalists throughout the but then something happened something that wasn 't street protests started to erupt in so paulo they began as very local and specific they were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city this is a bus it 's written there theft but but there was another conflict the one i believe that 's more important here to make my point that there was this mainstream media version of the facts that anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge if they presented their own vision of what was actually happening there and it was this clash of visions this clash of narratives that i think turned those protests into a long period in the country of political reckoning where hundreds of thousands of people it was about everything the people 's demands their expectations the reasons why they were on the streets could be as diverse as if you could read it you would understand me was in this environment of political catharsis that the country was going through indeed but it had to do also with a new way of organizing through a new way of communicating it was in that environment that mdia ninja emerged from almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon but it allowed us to do something else to show what it was like to be in the people at home a subjective because we are not behaving as a media outlet we are trying to encourage people to invite people and to actually teach people how to do this how they also and that was crucial to turn mdia ninja from so in a matter of a week or two as the protests kept happening we were covering more than fifty cities at the same time that 's something that no tv channel could ever do so we had a couple of thousands of followers on our facebook page and soon we had a quarter of a million followers our posts and our videos were being seen by more than it became almost like a public service to the citizen to the protester to the activist because they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool to confront both police and media authority many of our images started to be used in regular tv channels our livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular televisions when things got really rough some our images were responsible but that was also useful because we were still at the web so that helped to trigger an important debate in the country on the role of the media itself and the state of the freedom of the press in the country so mdia ninja now evolved and finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it it would become a national network of hundreds of young people what i started to do in the beginning of this year as mdia ninja is already a dedicating myself to another project it 's called fluxo which is portuguese for it 's a journalism studio in so paulo downtown where i used livestream to experiment with what i call but i 'm also trying to come up with ways to finance independent because now i really want to try to make a living out of my tear gas because after watching people using it not only to cover things but to express to organize themselves politically i believe livestream can turn cyberspace because livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast and it empowers the citizen through this direct and power of exchanging experiences and dialogue empowers them to and i believe it does something else that might be even more important that the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity in a very political way as i see it because it really helps so it helps the citizen but most of all thank you very much it was an honor"
