  "transcript": "the night before i was heading for scotland i was invited to host the final of china 's got talent show in shanghai susan boyle and i told her i 'm going to scotland the next day and she even managed to say a few words in chinese was a line from our chinese parallel susan boyle a but she didn 't understand any english or french or italian so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in chinese and the last sentence of nessun dorma that she was singing in the stadium was green onion for free so i guess both susan boyle and this vegetable vendor in shanghai belonged to yet their courage and talent brought them through and a show and a platform we are all different from different perspectives but i think being different is good because you present a different point of view you may have the chance to make a difference my generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of china that has made so many changes in the past twenty thirty years i was applying for a job in the sales department of the first hotel in beijing great wall sheraton it 's still there he finally said so miss yang do you have any questions to ask me i summoned my courage and poise and said yes but could you let me actually do you sell around the same time i was going through an audition the first ever open audition by national television in china innocent and beautiful fresh face innocent why can 't they have their own ideas and their own voice i thought i kind of offended them but actually they were impressed i was the last one to survive it so i was on a national television prime time show and believe it or not that was the first show on chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own which was unthought of so we do a lot of things i 've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past and sometimes i have young people approaching me say lan you changed my life and i feel proud of that but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country i was in beijing 's bidding for the olympic games i was representing the shanghai expo i saw china embracing the world and vice versa sometimes i 'm thinking what are today 's young generation up to so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social well this is a girl called guo meimei twenty years old beautiful she showed off her expensive bags clothes and car against the credibility of red cross the controversy was so heated that the red cross had to open a press conference to clarify it and the investigation is going on so far as of today we know that she herself made up that title probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity all those expensive items but anyway the public still doesn 't buy it it is still boiling it shows us a general mistrust of and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog microblog boomed in the year of two thousand and ten with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled a major news portal alone has more than one hundred and forty million two hundred million the most popular blogger it 's not me and because as you know the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government social media to let the steam out a little bit so how are they different first of all most of them were born in the now we have ended up with thirty million more young men than women that could pose a potential most have fairly good education the illiteracy rate in china among this generation is under one percent sixty five years old coming up with seven point some percent this year and about to be fifteen percent by the year of two thousand and thirty and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially and taking so it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy years old so making a living is not that easy for young people college graduates are not in short supply in urban areas college graduates find the starting salary is about four hundred u s dollars a month while the average rent so what do they do they have to share space squeezed in in very limited space to save money and they call themselves tribe of ants they figured out they have to work for thirty to forty years to afford their first apartment that ratio in america would only cost a couple five years to earn but in china it 's thirty to forty years with the skyrocketing real estate price they find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas most of them don 't want to go back but they don 't have the sense of belonging they work less social welfare and tightening loans from banks appreciation of the renminbi or decline of demand from europe or america for the products they produce appalling incident in a southern oem 20s committed suicide just one by one like causing but they died because of all different personal reasons but this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation both physical and mental of these migrant workers for those who do return back to the countryside they find themselves very welcome locally because with the knowledge skills and networks they 're able to create more jobs upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market so for the past few years the coastal areas they found themselves in a shortage of labor these diagrams show a more general social background the first one is the engels coefficient which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade but then in the two years it goes up again to thirty nine percent indicating a rising living cost the gini coefficient and so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of so any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand for the past decade or so a massive urbanization and development and it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation sometimes people get so when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the internet people cry for the government to take actions to stop this so the good news is that earlier this year the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition similarly many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the internet they have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a and then lately people are very concerned about cooking oil because thousands of people have been found [ so all these things have aroused a huge while young people seem to be very sure about their participation in but sometimes they 're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life china is soon to pass the u s as the number one market for luxury brands but you know what half of those consumers are earning a but of course we do have young people who would still prefer to smile whether in a bmw or [ on ] a bicycle the next picture you see a very popular phenomenon called naked wedding or naked marriage it does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding and also people are doing good through social media and the first picture showed us that a truck caging five hundred homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing people were donating money dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck and after hours of negotiation five hundred dogs were rescued and here also people are helping to find missing children a father posted his son so happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years but also it 's about the environment and also how capable is the to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time i guess these are the questions people are going to answer and our younger generation are going to transform this country thank you very much"
