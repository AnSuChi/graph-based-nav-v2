  "transcript": "i used to climb trees for fun all the time and now as a grown up i have made my profession the most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy and dr terry erwin in called the canopy the last biotic frontier i 'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy and share with you what canopy researchers are asking let 's start because of the overhanging leaves and branches you 'll notice that the understory is very dark it 's very still but rather showing you a very short clip from a national geographic film heroes of the high frontier this was filmed in monteverde costa rica and i think it gives us the best impression of what it 's like to climb a giant strangler fig but i 'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity and tell you about the there are ten thousand species of ants that taxonomists people who describe and name animals have named four thousand of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy he promised to name an ant after me which he did procryptocerus nalini a canopy ant we 've had two children august andrew and erika and actually he named ants after them so we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us but my passion in addition to jack and my children but rather it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog both in the temperate zone and in the tropics and these mosses generated by decomposing like peat moss in your garden they have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water one of the surprising things i discovered is that if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes what you 'll find underneath them are connections networks of what we call canopy roots these are not epiphyte roots these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves and so those epiphytes are actually paying landlord a bit of rent in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor we 've done stripping experiments where we 've removed mats of epiphytes and and looked we had predicted that they would grow back very quickly and that they would come in encroaching from the side what we found however was that they took an extremely long time over twenty years to regenerate starting from the bottom and growing up and even now after twenty five years they 're not up there they have not recolonized if it 's gone it 's gone and if you 're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom is really very slow these canopy communities are fragile well when we look out you and i over that canopy of the intact primary forest what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon one of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered we know it 's a lot but we do not yet know and by what processes carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere held in its in its biomass and moving on through the ecosystem so i hope i 've showed you that canopy dwellers are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy that tarzan and jane were interested in but rather that they foster biodiversity contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles and they also help to keep our global climate stable you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems you would also see scenes like this scenes of forest destruction forest harvesting and forest fragmentation thereby making i 've also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives people who grew up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees and forests as i did when i was a young girl this troubles me gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer i really have to ask myself what can i do about this how can i reconnect people with trees i know that as a scientist i have information and as a human being i can communicate with anybody and so we 're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy we also recognize forth you know they don 't reach everybody and so we 've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to treetop barbie we dress her in clothes that have been made and i 'd like to just tell you one of our projects which and we look at nature we and we communicate and exchange and express what we see together joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in costa rica they made a fabulous they danced in the forest and we are taking this dance my scientific outreach we had wooden flutists we had oboists we had opera singers we had guitar players and we had rap singers and i brought a little segment to give you of duke brady 's canopy rap experience of working with duke also led me to i saw the power of duke 's song with urban youth an audience you know i as a middle aged professor i don 't have a hope of getting to in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands we went out to they thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium there 's a whole industry of if you remember that bald guy you 'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the pacific northwest old growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back so this whole industry is unsustainable and i thought if i had some partners that could help me with they were very enthusiastic and i 've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been because the prison i brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners water catchment with a grant from the department of corrections at washington state they 've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons and our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in washington state and oregon so they will raise them in captivity of course from they will have the pleasure many of them of seeing those frogs that they 've raised from eggs and helped develop helped nurture move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild and so i think for many reasons ecological social economic and perhaps even spiritual this has been a tremendous project and i 'm really looking forward to my students doing it but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this as many of you are aware the world of academia is a rather inward looking one i 'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships and so i 'm hoping that my husband jack the ant taxonomist can perhaps work with mattel to make taxonomist ken perhaps ben zander and given the duress that we 're feeling environmentally in these times it is time for scientists to reach outward and i started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science by making these partnerships that i described to you i have really opened my mind and i have to say my heart to have a greater understanding to make other discoveries about nature i see trees this is actually an image of a real heart when we come to understand nature we are touching the most deep the most important parts of our self i have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into finally as a scientist and as a person i feel that i have better tools to go out to trees to go out to forests to go out to nature to make new discoveries about nature and about humans ' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are thank you very much"
