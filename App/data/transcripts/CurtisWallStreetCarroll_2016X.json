  "transcript": "i was fourteen years old and upon exiting the building a security guard grabbed my arm so i ran i ran down the street and i next time you little punks steal something you can carry laughter i was taken to juvenile hall and when i was released into the custody of my mother the first words my uncle said was how 'd you get caught were small what am i supposed to do i grew up in oakland california with my mother and members of my immediate family addicted to crack cocaine my environment consisted of friends and homeless shelters dinner was served in breadlines and soup kitchens the big homey told me this money rules the world i committed my first and it was the first time that i was told that i had potential and felt like somebody believed in me and then one day and we did it the reality was while i watched my mother stand in line at a blood bank so i never so i got mine by any means necessary i got mine financial literacy really did rule the world and i was a child slave to it following the bad guy at seventeen years old i was arrested for robbery and murder so i wanted in one day i rushed to grab the sports page of the newspaper so my cellie could read it to me and i accidentally picked up the business section hey youngster you pick stocks and i said what 's that he said that 's the place where white folks keep all their money and it was the first time he gave me this brief description of what fighting for freedom i never had i was lost the homeys it was rough man it was but little did i know i was receiving the greatest gifts i had ever dreamed of self worth candy wrappers clothing logos street signs everything and then at i picked up the business section of the newspaper i wanted to find these rich white folks true and i had to own up to that i had to take responsibility for that and i did i was building a curriculum that could teach incarcerated men how to manage money through prison employments properly managing our lifestyle would provide transferrable tools that we can use to manage money when we reenter society like the majority of people did who didn 't commit crimes then i discovered that according to marketwatch sixty percent of the american population has under one thousand dollars in savings what the hell you mean to tell me that people worked their whole lives buying and material stuff but were living check to check how in the world were members of society going to help incarcerated individuals back into society if they couldn 't manage they own stuff we screwed so i now had an obligation to meet those on the path and it was crazy because financial illiteracy is a disease that has crippled minorities and the lower class in our society for generations and generations and we should be furious about that ask yourselves this how can fifty percent our access to justice our social status living conditions transportation and food are all dependent on money that most people can 't manage it 's crazy it according to the extortion and the list goes on check this out a typical incarcerated person would enter the california prison system earn thirty cents an hour over eight hundred dollars a year with no real expenses and save no money upon his parole he will be given two hundred dollars gate money and told hey good luck stay out of trouble don 't come back to prison what does he do at sixty get a good job or go back to the very criminal behavior that led him to prison in the first place so how do we cure this disease i cofounded a program that we call financial empowerment emotional literacy we call and it teaches how do you separate your emotional decisions from your financial decisions control your cost of living borrow money effectively and diversify your finances by allowing your money to work for you instead of you working for it incarcerated people need these life skills before we reenter society you can 't have full rehabilitation without these life skills and whoever told you that is lying a professional is a person who knows his craft better than most and nobody knows how much money you need have or want better than you which means you are the professional financial literacy is not a skill ladies and gentlemen it 's a lifestyle financial stability is a byproduct of a proper lifestyle a financially sound incarcerated person can become a taxpaying citizen and a financially sound taxpaying citizen can remain one this allows us to create a bridge between those people and let 's get to the heart of what 's been crippling our society from taking care of your responsibility to be better life managers and let 's provide a simple and easy to use curriculum that gets to the heart the heart of what financial empowerment and emotional literacy really is"
