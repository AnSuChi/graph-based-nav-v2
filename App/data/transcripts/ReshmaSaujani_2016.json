  "transcript": "i did something really brave or some would say really stupid i ran for congress for years i had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser as an organizer i always wanted to run this was my way to make a difference to disrupt the i swore i had the endorsement from the new york daily and i only got nineteen percent of the vote and the same papers that said i was a rising political star now said i wasted one point three million dollars on six thousand three hundred and twenty one votes don 't do the math it was humiliating i tell you the story of how i ran for congress because i was thirty three years old and it was the first time in my entire life where i didn 't worry about being perfect and so many women i talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they 're going to be great in that they know they 're going to be perfect in and it 's no wonder why most girls we 're taught to smile pretty play it safe get all a 's crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off whether they 're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on take risk after risk they 're rewarded for it it 's often said in silicon valley no one even takes you seriously unless you 've had two failed start ups and we 're raising our boys to be brave some people worry about our federal deficit but i i worry about our bravery deficit our economy our society we 're just losing out the bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in stem in c suites in boardrooms in congress and pretty much everywhere you look psychologist carol dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them they found it energizing they were more likely to redouble their efforts what 's going on including math and science so it 's not a question of ability and it doesn 't just end in fifth grade an hp report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only sixty percent of the qualifications but women women will apply only if they meet one hundred percent of the qualifications one hundred percent this study is usually invoked as evidence that well but i think it 's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection and they 're overly cautious when we 're ambitious even when we 're leaning in that socialization of perfection has caused us to take less risks in our careers and so those six hundred thousand jobs that are open right now in computing and tech women are being left behind and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect so in two thousand and twelve i started a company to teach girls to code and what i found is that by teaching them to code i had socialized them to be it 's an endless process of trial and error of trying to get the right command in the right place with sometimes just a semicolon and it often takes many many tries until that magical moment when what you 're trying to build comes to life during the first week when the girls are learning how to code a student will call her over and she 'll say i don 't know what code to write and she 'll see a blank text editor but if she presses undo a few times she 'll see that her student wrote code but she didn 't get it exactly right instead of showing the progress that she made she 'd rather show nothing at all perfection or bust it turns out that our girls are really good but it 's not enough just to teach them to code my friend lev brie who is a professor at the university of columbia and teaches intro to java tells me about his office hours with computer science students when the guys are struggling with an assignment they 'll come in and professor there 's something wrong with my code the girls will come in and say professor there 's something wrong with me because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system i 'm afraid to ask a question because i don 't want to be the only one who doesn 't understand the only one who is struggling when we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on and i see this take for instance two of our high school students who built a game called tampon run yes tampon run to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming or the syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help americans get to the polls or girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy 's life because he has cancer these are just three examples of and whether they become coders or the next hillary clinton or beyonc they will not defer their dreams and those dreams have never been more important we cannot leave behind and we 've got to do it we have to teach them to be brave in schools and early in their careers when it has the most potential to impact their lives and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect and so i need each of you to tell every young woman you know your sister your niece your employee your colleague because when we teach girls to be and we help them leverage it we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us thank you it 's such a powerful vision you have you have a vision we taught twenty girls this year we 'll teach forty thousand in all fifty states and that number is really powerful because last year we we only graduated seven thousand five hundred women in computer science like the problem is so bad that we can make that type of change quickly ca and you 're working with some of the companies in this room even who are welcoming graduates from your program rs yeah we have about eighty partners from twitter to facebook to microsoft to pixar to disney i mean every single company out there and if you 're not signed up i 'm going to find you because we need every single tech company to embed a girls who code classroom in their office ca and you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in i mean i think that it 's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now eighty five percent of all consumer purchases are made by they build awesome things and we see it every day ca reshma this whole community is cheering you on more power to"
