  "transcript": "it is are not that many things on earth that are almost everything productivity is the principal driver so we have a problem in the largest european economies productivity used to the same profile in the us despite a momentary rebound fifteen years ago the information the new information and communication technologies every generation is twice as smaller roofs or perhaps no roof at all less access to education think of all chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis because the basic tenets about efficiency effectiveness in organizations in management everywhere in public services in companies in the way we work the way we innovate invest try to learn to work better there are two ways to look at it to prove it the one i prefer is rigorous it 's a bit more animated more visual and also faster hopefully it 's faster notably if you compare them to an average team say the french team individual times of the us runners they arrive at the finish line three point two meters they arrive based on the data we are going at some point you will see towards the end that torri edwards the fourth us runner is ahead not surprising this year she got the gold medal in the the second runner in the three point five billion women on earth and the two other runners on the us team are not bad either the average team is trying to catch up let 's watch the race so what happened the fastest team did not win the slower one did by the way i hope you appreciate the deep historical research i did to make the french look good but why because of cooperation when you hear this sentence thanks to cooperation the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts those who carry the baton are but their baton is faster it multiplies energy intelligence in human efforts it is the essence of human efforts how we work together how what happens to cooperation when the holy grail measurement accountability appears compliance audits it is as though the runners on the team were saying let 's be clear am i supposed to run for to take it or not we need somebody accountable since passing the baton is so important now we will have a new dedicated athlete and we will have at least two we will know who to blame if you think about it we pay more attention to knowing who to blame than to creating the conditions to succeed we are creating organizations able to fail and we are quite effective at that you have to do it at the right time in the right hand at the right speed but to do that you have to put energy in your arm it will come at the expense of your measurable speed and you have to shout loud so you have to recognize the voice of your colleague you cannot say is it you too late now and concentrate on the third runner look at where she allocates her efforts her energy her attention arm eye brain that makes a difference in whose legs but when the next runner runs or because of the way the third runner passed the baton there is no metric on earth that will give us the answer it is how you allocate your effort it is to take a risk sacrifice the ultimate protection granted by objectively measurable individual performance it is you know measurement to build advantage on a global scale to create value measurement we multiply structures processes systems you know this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a counterproductive and the more complicated the organization proxies reports key performance indicators metrics so people put their energy in what can get measured we add even more structure process systems people spend their time in meetings based on our analysis but working harder and harder longer and longer on less and less value adding activities our organizations are wasting human don 't blame their mindsets their mentalities their personality look at the work situations is when we blame personalities the measurement remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance speed the what look at cooperation am i putting my energy in what can get measured my legs my speed you as managers are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate our societies thank you"
