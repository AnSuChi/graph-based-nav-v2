  "transcript": "but music is even more powerful if you don 't just listen to it but you make it yourself so that and we all know about the mozart effect the idea that 's been around for the last five to ten years that just by listening to music but it doesn 't work at all but everybody each of us everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way and that 's one of the main parts of my work we 've been engaged in a field called active music what are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience not just listening but making music and we started by making instruments for some of the world 's greatest performers we call these hyperinstruments for yo yo ma peter gabriel prince orchestras rock bands instruments where they 're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument so the instrument knows how it 's being played it 's a whole orchestra of about one hundred instruments all designed for touch a special surface to and when we make the brain opera we invite the public to come in to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the brain opera we toured that guitar hero came out of our lab and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the mit media lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface because my second idea is that it 's not enough just to want to make music in something like guitar hero it 's very very important music can change your life more than almost anything it can change the way you communicate with others it can change your body it can change your mind so we 're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like guitar hero we are very involved in education we have a long term project called toy symphony want to spend their time doing it and then will demand to know how it works how to make more how to create so we make squeezy instruments like these music shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms they gather your rhythm and like hot potato you send your rhythm to your friends who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite so we 've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative creative activities in a much broader context for all kinds of people who don 't usually have the opportunity to make music so one of the growing fields that we 're working on at the media lab right now is music mind and health it 's a great book if you haven 't seen it it 's worth reading he 's a pianist himself and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples ' lives in unusual situations maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones you can find somebody who can 't recognize their face in the mirror or can 't tell anyone in their family but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing and with that you can bring back parts of people 's memories and personalities music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes movement to people with and we do this in many ways we work with many different hospitals one of them is right near boston called tewksbury hospital it 's a long term state hospital where several years ago we started working with hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities this has become a central part of the treatment at tewksbury hospital so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities it 's the activity that seems to accelerate people 's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community i wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before i go on the manipulating each other 's rhythms but to train your musical memory and and playing music in a group to get their hands on music to shape it everybody can experience music in a profound way we just have to make different tools the third idea i want to share with you is that i think even more than words is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are i love giving talks strangely i feel more nervous giving talks than playing music if i were here playing cello or playing on a synth or sharing my music with you i think that 's true for for many of us and i want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have from ourselves to the outside world and it 's a big opera one of the larger opera he downloads himself into his environment the main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage it becomes his legacy and the opera is about what we can share what we can pass on to others to the people we love and what we can 't every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument like this chandelier it takes up the whole stage it looks like a chandelier but it 's actually a robotic music instrument so as you can see in this each string is controlled with a little robotic element either little bows that stroke the strings acoustic signals that vibrate the strings we also have an army of robots on stage these robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character simon powers and his family there we 've designed these square robots that we 're testing right now at mit called operabots these operabots follow my music they go off on their own and then they can also when you snap line up exactly the way you 'd like to even though they 're cubes they actually have a lot of personality the largest set piece in the opera is called the system it 's every single book is robotic so they all move they all make sound but the whole physical environment the books also have on the spines so it 's all display here 's the great baritone james maddalena as he enters the system this premieres in monaco it 's in september two thousand and nine another idea with this project here 's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form through music and through the environment but we 're also making this available both online and in public spaces as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love so instead of being grand opera this opera will turn into what we 're thinking of as personal opera and if you 're going to make a personal opera what about a personal instrument everything i 've shown you so far whether it 's a hyper cello for yo yo ma or squeezy toy for a child but what if i could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way i i think that this is the future of interface it 's the future of of music the future of instruments and i 'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage so that i can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like so can you give a hand to adam boulanger and dan ellsey dan thanks to ted and to bombardier flexjet dan is here with us today all the way from tewksbury he 's a resident at tewksbury hospital this is by far the farthest he 's strayed from tewksbury hospital i can tell you that because he 's motivated to meet with you today and show you i have always loved music and i am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software to have you here really dan so we met dan and it turned out he was really fantastic at it he 's a born composer he 's very shy too actually he is quite well known in the boston area mentors people at the hospital and children in how to make their own music and i 'll let adam tell you so adam is a ph d student at mit an expert in music technology and medicine and adam and dan have become close collaborators what adam 's been working on for but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument so you want to say a little bit about how you guys work adam boulanger yes and so we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance with precision with control and despite his physical disability to be able to do that to be able to perform his piece of music process and the technology basically first we needed an engineering solution so you know we have a firewire camera it looked at an infrared pointer we went with the type of with his speaking controller and this was actually the least interesting part of the work you know the design process we needed an input we needed continuous tracking in the software we look at the types of shapes he 's making following the engineering part where basically we 're coding over dan 's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out you know how does dan move what 's useful to him as an expressive motion you know what 's his metaphor for performance what types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music so all the parameter fitting and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just dan and you know i think this is a perspective shift it 's not that our technologies but what about expression what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work you know do our technologies allow us to express do they provide structure for us to do that and you know that 's a personal relationship to expression dan we needed a new design process a new engineering process to sort of so dan do you want to he 's incredibly fast at it too faster than i am in fact you start out by making melodies and rhythms he can place those exactly where he wants each one gets a color he goes back into the composition window draws the lines places everything the way he wants to looking at the hyperscore you can see it also you can see where the sections are something might continue for a while change get really crazy and then end up with a with a big bang at the end we then figured out the best way to have him analyze his movements it 's going to let dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to and you 're also going to notice a visual on the screen we asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement i think it gives an understanding of how we 're picking out movement from what dan 's doing but i think it will also show you if you look at that movement that when dan makes music his motions are very purposeful very precise very disciplined and they 're also very beautiful so in hearing this piece as i mentioned before the most important thing is the music 's great and it 'll show you who dan is so the ok the the"
