  "transcript": "this is this is a tapir now this this is a baby tapir the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom far there is no competition here i 've been thinking really really hard about the impact of i 've been questioning myself about the real contributions i have made for the conservation of these animals i love so much am i being effective in safeguarding their survival i guess the big question here is am i studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation or am i just documenting we all know that it 's all over the news every day tropical forests and other ecosystems are climate change so many species on the brink of extinction adults can weigh up to three hundred kilos that 's half the size of a horse they 're gorgeous and they absolutely need large patches of habitat in order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution and you see this is very very unfortunate because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found they 're herbivores fifty percent which they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces they play this major major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest and for that reason tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest isn 't that amazing if you think about it the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect biodiversity as a whole and it was a pioneer research and conservation program at that point we had nearly zero information about tapirs mostly because they 're so difficult to study they 're nocturnal long term datasets to support conservation action and i told you tapirs are very hard to study so we have to on indirect methods to study them we have to capture and anesthetize them so that we can install gps collars around their necks and follow their movements and then we can gather information about how they use space how they move through the landscape what are their priority habitats and so much more we must disseminate what we learn we have to educate people about tapirs and how important these animals are and it 's amazing how many people around the world do not know what a tapir is in fact many people think this is a tapir let me tell you this is not a tapir this is a giant anteater tapirs do not eat ants and then next we have to provide training capacity building it is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future and they need the passion to do that ultimately we conservationists we must be able to apply our data to apply our accumulated knowledge to support actual conservation action one of the most threatened biomes in the world the destruction of the atlantic forest began in the early the portuguese first arrived in brazil agriculture cattle ranching and the construction of cities and today only seven percent of the atlantic forest is still left standing and tapirs are found in very very small in the atlantic forest we found out that tapirs move through open areas of pastureland and agriculture going from one patch of forest to patch of forest so our main approach in this region was to use our tapir data to identify the potential places for the establishment establishment of wildlife corridors in between those patches of forest reconnecting the habitat so that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely and working in the pantanal has been extremely refreshing and we have been able to study tapirs in the most natural conditions we 'll ever find very much free of threats in the pantanal besides the gps collars we are using another technique camera traps this camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you 're trying to develop those conservation strategies today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country where natural habitat and wildlife populations are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats and somehow tapirs are still there but i have to say that starting this new program in the cerrado was a bit of a slap in the face when you drive around and you find dead tapirs along the highways and signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations where they shouldn 't be and you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes because their families poach and eat them it really breaks your heart i am swimming against the tide it made me realize that despite and you know what we really came to a point in the conservation world where we have to think out of the box we 'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now and i told you roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the cerrado so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers on the gps collars we put on the tapirs these are the same stickers used on big trucks to avoid collision tapirs cross the highways after dark so the stickers will hopefully and maybe they will slow down a little bit and although i 'm struggling with all these questions in my i have a pact with tapirs i know in my heart that tapir conservation is my cause this is my passion i have this huge network of supporters behind me and there is no way i 'm ever going to stop i will continue doing this most probably for the rest of my life doing this for patrcia my namesake one of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the atlantic forest many many years ago for rita and her baby vincent in the pantanal and i 'll keep doing this for ted a baby tapir we captured in december last year also and i will keep doing this for the hundreds of tapirs that i 've had the pleasure to meet over the years and the many others i know i will encounter in the future these animals deserve to be cared for we human beings deserve to live in a world where we can get out there and see and benefit from not only tapirs thank you so much"
