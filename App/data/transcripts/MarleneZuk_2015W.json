  "transcript": "people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying at least according to a one thousand nine hundred and seventy three book of lists survey which which preceded all those online best worst funniest lists that you only heights and public speaking exceeded now i am not one of those really love insects i think they 're interesting and beautiful and sometimes even cute and i 'm not alone for centuries some of the greatest minds in science from charles darwin to e o wilson have drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on earth well why is that what is that keeps us coming back to insects maybe as many as ten million this means that you could have an and not have to reuse a species for over eighty thousand years take that pandas and kittens more seriously insects are essential we need them scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure but what i love most about insects is what they can tell us about our own behavior insects seem like they do everything that people do they meet they mate they fight they break up and they do so with what looks like love or but what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own and that difference can be really illuminating now i will maintain and i think i can defend what may seem like a surprising statement i think sex in insects is more interesting and the wild variety that we see makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female of course to start with virgin birth right there on your rose bushes when they do have sex even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm there are some kinds of fruit flies and that 's important because the males use their sperm to compete dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like swiss army knives with all of the attachments pulled out they use these formidable devices like scoops to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with so what given this is probably just as well but what i think insects do is break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles so people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version of what males and females are like so that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive and females are passive and coy 's own body and they 're interesting a lot of insects supposed to be dominant and i really love"
