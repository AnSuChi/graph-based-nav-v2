  "transcript": "i headed back to the corner and i had been blind for about a year things were going pretty well and waited my turn as it went off i took off i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me so slid the chair now i was getting a little anxious i now i was officially freaking out so i yelled who the hell 's out there what 's going on just then over my shout i heard something else a familiar rattle it and i reached out with my left hand as my fingers brushed against something perhaps a golden retriever maybe she was volunteering for service laughter but that little story is really about the the fears and misconceptions that come along seemingly oblivious so let me step back and set the stage a little bit on i reported reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor it was gone i was struck by an incredible sense of fear of confusion of vulnerability like anybody would but as i had time to stop and think i actually started to realize i had a lot to be grateful for who had passed away from complications i was seven at the time so although i had every reason i knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have active life i left with a mission a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as i could and get on to rebuilding my life within six months i had returned to work my training had started i even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies and was commuting to work on it was a lot of hard work but what i didn 't anticipate through that that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time outsights ranged from the the trival to the profound from the mundane to the humorous as an architect that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city paramount amongst those and then i was also surprised by the city 's propensity for kindness and care and then i started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is is learning to rely things that you would otherwise maybe ignore it 's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you i was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are just through the grip of the cane you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you 're headed similarly just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment some districts and cities have their own smell as do places and things around you and if you 're lucky you can even follow your nose to that new bakery because i started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi sensory than my sighted experience ever was what struck me also was how much the city was changing around me and i don 't know who 's watching who but i have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me and i 'm not paranoid but everywhere i go i 'm getting all sorts of advice go here move there watch out for this a lot of the information is good some of it 's helpful a lot 's kind of reversed you 've got to figure out what they actually meant but it 's and came to a corner i was waiting for an an audible pedestrian signal and as it went off i was just about to step out into the street when all of a sudden my and yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street speaking to me in mandarin it 's so it 's kind of nice to say hello first would you like some help but i 've really been struck by how much the city it was fine it 's a perfectly great city but once i lost my sight and was walking i was blessed every block of the way and often it 's thought that that 's an emotion that comes up out of pity and i think it 's pretty cool in fact if i 'm feeling down i just go to broadway in downtown oakland i go for a walk and i feel better like that in no time at all economic lines everybody 's welcome i 've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people because it is certainly far more inclusive than the so my final takeaway for you is that and i 'm so sure of that that i want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast it 's too late walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous the space between buildings will be if you 're blind you don 't drive they don 't like it when you drive accessible well connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around lots of jobs blind people want to work too they want to earn a living i hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive a more equitable a more just city for all and based on my prior sighted experience it sounds like a pretty cool city whether you 're blind whether you have a disability or you haven 't quite found yours yet"
