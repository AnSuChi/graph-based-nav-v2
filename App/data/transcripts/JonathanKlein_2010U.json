  "transcript": "we 're naive we 're but we 're also aware so let 's begin with a group of images perhaps they 're cliches in fact they 're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form we 're looking for something more we 're looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues images that transcend borders that transcend religions images that provoke us to step up and do something in other words to act well this image you 've all seen it changed our view of the physical world we had never seen our planet from this perspective before many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time forty years later this group more than most are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment and at last we appear to be doing something about it this destructive power takes many different forms for example these images taken by brent stirton in the congo and unsurprisingly they sparked international outrage we 've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in haiti what is far worse samuel pisar an auschwitz survivor said and i 'll quote him the holocaust teaches us that nature even in its cruelest moments is benign in comparison with man when he loses his moral compass and his reason there 's another kind of crucifixion the horrifying images from abu ghraib some would argue furthermore those moral high ground of the occupying forces let 's go back a little in the 1960s and 1970s the vietnam war was basically shown in america 's living rooms day in day out news photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war a little girl burned by napalm a student killed by the national guard at kent state university in ohio during a protest now images have power to and in particular i 've given a lot of talks on this but i 'll just show one image the issue of hiv aids hundred and touching an hiv aids infected baby better than most knew the power of an image we all have a choice we can look away or we can address the image thankfully when these photos appeared in the guardian in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight they put a lot of focus images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other and i think it 's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of americans when they went to vote in november two thousand and eight images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them i but images don 't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war john moore set up this photo at arlington cemetery after all the tense moments of conflict there 's one photograph from a much quieter place ansel adams said and i 'm going to disagree with him you don 't take a photograph you make it in my view it 's not the photographer who makes the photo it 's you we bring to each image our own values our own belief systems and as a result of that the image resonates with us my company has seventy million images i have one image in my office here it is and thank you to all the photographers"
