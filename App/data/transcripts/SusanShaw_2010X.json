  "transcript": "i am a marine toxicologist and i 've been very very concerned about the gulf particularly about the massive applications of the toxic dispersants the corexits i 've been working on ocean pollution for quite a long time the impacts on marine life and particularly the impacts on marine mammals as it turns out marine mammals are at the top of this food chain that we 're pouring millions of i 'm sorry to have a sad slide like this but not everything is all that happy especially in my work they are and they 're dying off rather regularly tens of thousands around the world it 's predicted they may go extinct about a third of them so my project is along the northwest atlantic it 's called seals as sentinels we 're tracking pollution at the top of the food web in marine mammals and fish it 's a investigation we 're looking at a lot of compounds but recently been quite interested in the flame retardants the brominated flame retardants that are in many many things that we use in our everyday so we are tracking how do these things get from the products into the ocean which is the final sink for them and there 's quite a complicated pathway for that they get concentrated they wind up in waste water treatment plants e waste dumps and all that gets into surface waters eventually reaching the ocean the final sink we did find quite high levels as we expected of these flame retardants in the harbor seals ' bodies and we reported this it led to a ban of this neuro toxic flame retardant called deca in maine where i am based and also then so then i got really curious myself as a toxicologist and i donated some blood to my lab and said okay let 's do it well we detected one hundred and and i must say if any of you would have this done you 'd probably find a similar profile or cocktail as they call it but i was the recipient of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason and just to point out the levels americans have ten to forty times higher levels of these compounds in our bodies but then i thought well in case of a fire i might be the last one to ignite so anyway here 's the problem and it is a problem that we 're looking at in the gulf today we 're not regulating chemicals in this country properly we 're hardly regulating them at all and jackie savitz spoke this morning about big oil and the propaganda and how we 're all brainwashed with lies plus they don 't give health and safety data so so it 's a case of the burden of proof is not on the producer so i then was invited to go to the gulf in may i went down there on a preliminary investigation to look into dispersants and how they 're going into the water column and so forth and and we dove in the slick without even hazmat gear and i did get sick i got a ferocious sore throat two days later i felt like my throat was on fire and what i did see in the water as we went down what really shocked me and it 's haunted me ever since because i could see the droplets of oil and as you go down they 're catching all kinds of plankton bumping into little wisps of life that are the food for the planktivores the herring kind of fish and you could just see the web of death we got into this in the beginning and i didn 't agree with that decision at the time i still don 't and as you know there 's been a very weak response up until recently to actually collect the oil it 's gotten much more aggressive this is an exxon slide showing what happens the scenario and the trade off but it is not harming the corals or the sea grass right so here we have the but you 're saving the mangrove so this to me is like going to the eye doctor okay is it better with one or two the problem is that we have released so darn much of this stuff we 're climbing up to two million gallons very quickly it turns out there are plumes and actually one of our federal officials said that it was probably heat stress been in that water which has solvent in it so it so what do we have the bp show is going on our officials complained about corexit which is the most toxic line of dispersants but and they used the most toxic one the nine thousand five hundred and twenty seven until they ran out of supplies thousand five hundred nine thousand five so what we 're doing we 're putting and i want to show you this cute little thing that happens here it 's a micelle micelles form around the oil and what happens first is the solvents break into the oil they let the surfactants in there the surfactants which are like things we use on fast food wrappers they grab around the droplets of oil and they make little tiny droplets with nice little surfactant the thing to remember about the micelles so from a toxicology perspective this is really awful because and usually the exposure is a combined exposure so they break down lipid membranes so it actually hastens oil getting into the body easily and readily oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds and other compounds that are toxic to every organ in the body and so with the dispersants combined you have this very synergistic combined toxicity which is a national group of and what is it doing and what are the interactions so we did find that corexit nine thousand five hundred contains heavy metals arsenic and chromium arsenic at at high this is what we have to look at these you know ridiculous safety data sheets which have nothing on them much and now they were forced to release the ultimate list of everything that 's in corexit these are whole big groups of and then you get down to the petroleum distillates which are the solvents hundreds of them and why trade secrets again bp 's running the show this is all they have to do so far these ingredients have not been released and toxicologists are actually going nuts because we cannot predict with certainty what the interactions and toxic results are going to be but we do have quite a lot at risk down there as we all know the so much and then part of this is just part of my and i appreciate being able to and this is a study that was done on the australian coast the coast of tasmania you know the home to about a quarter of all marine species and with the corexit percent fertilization so they 're a very sensitive species to this combo these are the little herring fish that go through the water column with their mouths open feeding indiscriminately and just lapping up this brown pudding of toxic and we do know from other studies that this is a highly toxic mixture see the oil and corexit is causing death at that 's probably as far as what we do know about toxic effects but the cobia the respiratory system is very sensitive think about it with the corexit hitting the membranes and it will clog up the gills and then these animals are going to be something like what you call chemical pneumonia trying to aspirate the compounds it also will cause internal bleeding i 'm very worried about the air breathing mammals because i study them but also the way their going to be exposed is every time they come to the surface to take a breath they 're going to inhale these volatile fumes and what does happen with that eventually is pneumonia and you 're having a lot of different unpleasant effects but burns to the eyes and mouth we started hypothesizing so our thought was and that 's about as far as we it turns out we 're not very good at figuring this stuff out this is what the exxon valdez scientists thought would happen this trophic cascade where you lose the kelp and the herring and other fishes and going up they thought that eventually the killer whale would be at the top of this much more specific actually the kelp and the barnacles attach to the rock were decimated by the combination of corexit and the oil they were replaced by invasive species which had less holding power to the rock so we are launching i mean independent in the sense of not tied to but we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts but we need lots and lots of partners to do this intelligently we have some of the partners lined up dave gallo signed on don 't we have the right to know surely we have the right to learn what loss we are are going through in the gulf and my wish would be for the the gulf prize would be that we have so i appreciate being here thank you"
