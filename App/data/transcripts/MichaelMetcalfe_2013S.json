  "transcript": "we 've hit a big the aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments which have fallen for two consecutive years my question is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help thanks to these as you 'll learn are very much at the heart of my talk on the left we have pia she lives in england she has two loving parents one of whom is standing right here dorothy on the right lives in rural kenya she 's one of thirteen thousand orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity that i support i do that deserves the best life chances that we can afford to give her you 'll all agree with me i 'm sure the agrees too their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all but and here 's that hurdle can we afford our aid aspirations set themselves a target to increase overseas aid payments to zero point seven percent of their national income as you can see a big gap opens up between actual aid and that target but then come the millennium development goals ambitious targets to be met by two thousand and fifteen if i tell you that just one of those targets is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty you get a sense of the ambition there 's also been the number of people living on less than $ one point two five a day has halved one in eight remain hungry in the context of this auditorium the front two rows aren 't going to get any food we can 't settle for that which is why the concern about the eighth goal which relates to funding beginning is falling is so troubling i work in financial markets not development i study the behavior of investors how they react to policy but it took an innocent question from my daughter to make me appreciate that pia and i were on the way to a local cafe and we passed a man collecting for charity i didn 't have any change and she was disappointed once in the cafe pia takes out her and she shows me a drawing of a five note to give to the man outside it 's so sweet and more generous than dad would have been so i launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money chasing a limited number of goods sends something about that exchange stuck with me not because of the look of relief on pia 's face when i finally finished but because it related to the sanctity of the money supply a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction of central banks to the financial crisis to reassure investors central banks began buying assets to try and encourage investors to do the same they funded these purchases with money they created themselves the money wasn 't actually but the amount created was the central banks of the and japan increased the stock of money in their economies by three point seven trillion dollars that 's three times yet it was accepted remarkably quickly but bonds they bought equities too for all the scare stories the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence that confidence after years of keeping inflation under control central banks were trusted secondly inflation as you can see in the united states inflation for most of this period remained below average so how does all this relate is where dorothy and the mango tree charity that supports her comes in i was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year and i was inspired to give a one off donation when i remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make so think of this instead of just being able to help dorothy and four of her classmates so following that conversation with my daughter and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time this made me wonder could we match but just on a much grander scale let 's call this and here 's how it might work provided it saw the central bank would be mandated to match the government 's overseas aid payments up to a certain limit governments have been aiming to get aid to zero point seven percent for years so let 's set the limit at half of that zero point three five percent of their income the central bank would simply top it up with a further zero point two percent so far so good well this involves the creation of money the first is that by definition this money printed would be spent so it 's not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing unless so let 's think of an example where print aid was in place in the payments made by those governments over the last four years print aid would have generated two hundred billion dollars ' worth of extra aid what would that look like in the context of the increase in the money stock that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system you read for this so what we 're saying here is that we took a $ three point seven trillion gamble to save our financial systems and you know what it paid off there was no inflation are we really saying that it 's not worth the risk to print an extra two hundred billion for aid would the risks really be that different to me it 's not that clear what is clear even though this is the printing of just three central banks the global aid that 's given over this period is up by almost forty percent aid as a proportion of national income all of a sudden is now we don 't get to zero point seven percent governments are still incentivized to give but you know what that 's the point of a matching scheme so i think what we 've learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme but the benefits we might be able to feed the front row apart from the fact that i 've run out of time is that the window of opportunity for this idea is a short one today today there are universally agreed aims for international aid that today might be the only time that these two things coincide such that afford the aid that we 've always aspired to give so i seriously believe the question should be why not"
