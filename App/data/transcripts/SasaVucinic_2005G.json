  "transcript": "but it 's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what 's going on sasha vucinic it 's a great clip isn 't it and i found that in twenty nine seconds it tells more about the power of and importance of independent media than i could say in so i thought that it will be good to start with it according to relevant researchers eighty three percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press think about that number eighty three percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries the information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information or colors that that is just to understand how big and important this problem is now those i think should enjoy it until enjoy it while it lasts because as we heard yesterday but they can also lose press freedom as i guess americans among us can tell so i can go back to my story my story starts the story i want to share starts in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one at that time i was running b92 the only independent and i guess we were sharing we had that operating in hostile environment where government really wants to make your life miserable and there are different ways yeah it was the usual cocktail a little bit of threats a little bit of friendly advice a little bit of financial police a little bit of text control so you always have somebody who never leaves your office but what they really do which is very powerful and that is what governments in the late market forces are actually you know destroyed and the advertisers do not want to come and you have a problem making ends meet that time at the beginning of the ' 90s we had that problem which was you know survival below one side but what was really painful for me was remember the beginning of the ' 90s yugoslavia is falling apart we were sitting over there had all of that on tapes we had the ability to understand what was going on we were actually recording history the problem was that we had to re tape that history a week later because if we did not we could not afford so if i gave you that picture i don 't want to go too long on that in that context a gentleman came to my office at that time it was still and what did i know at that time about media systems i would think media systems were organizations which means so i prepared two plans for that meeting two strategic plans the small one and the big so we can keep that archive for the next fifty years the big plan was because i thought i and i thought that b92 will survive which turned out to be true it 's now probably either the and i thought that the only thing that we needed at that time loan to take us through those hard times to make a long story short the gentleman comes into the office great suit and tie i gave him what i thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be anyway after that whole big long explanation the only question he had for me and this is not a joke is are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of michael jackson that was really the only question he had left and i remember being being actually very angry at myself because i thought there must be an institution in the world somebody must have started something like that and i thought i 'm just dumb and i cannot find it in my defense there was no google at that time you could not just google in ' now we go from here fast forward to trying for the third time to convince him that foundation should invest in something that should operate like you know forget about charity it doesn 't work forget about handouts twenty thousand dollars do not what you should do is you should treat media companies as a business you will never see your money back but my foundations will put five hundred thousand dollars so you can he said i 'll give you a rope to hang yourself i knew two things after that meeting first under no circumstances i want to hang myself and second that i have no idea how to make it work you but it 's one thing to have a concept it 's a totally separate thing to had the wrong idea i thought that we can be a bank you see banks i don 't know if there are any bankers over here i apologize in advance but it 's the best job in the world you know you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money you give them more money they repay you that over a time why don 't we get into that business so here we are having our first client so here 's the daily newspaper that has to be printed four hundred kilometers away from the capital it it 's a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper and we said that 's fine let 's meet you 'll bring us your business plan i get these two pieces of paper not like this a4 format so it 's much bigger and that 's the best they could do we were the best that they could do so that is how we understood what our method is it 's not a bank we had actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them by establishing management systems by providing all that knowledge how do you run a business on one side while they all know how to run how to create content forty million dollars average interest rate five percent to lately we are going wild charging seven percent from time to time return rate the one that soros percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time what do we typically finance we finance anything that a media company would need from printing presses to what is most important is lease whatever is appropriate for we believe that in the last ten years companies that we 've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world and i could spend hours talking about them because they 're all kind of and i can but i 'll give you just maybe one and depending on time i may give you two examples who we work with you see we started working in eastern and central europe and moved to russia our first loan in russia was in chelyabinsk i 'll bet half of you have never heard of that place in the south of russia there 's a guy called boris nikolayevich kirshin who is running an independent newspaper there the city was closed of all things they were producing glass for tupolev planes anyway he 's running independent newspaper there after two years working with us he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place boris nikolayevich i understand you are doing a great job and because i have elections there are elections coming up in nine months i will not run but it 's very important for me who is going to succeed me so give me the paper for nine months i 'll give it back to you i have no boris nikolayevich says it 's not for sale the governor says we will close you boris nikolayevich says no you cannot do it six months later the newspaper was closed luckily we had enough time to help boris nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one to get all the subscription lists but that is what happens if you 're in business of independent media and if you are a banker for independent media so it somewhere down the road we opened a media management center we started our media lab sounds but there is a second second angle to that the second angle like in this clip if forty million dollars over ten years spread over seventeen countries that is not too much is it it 's actually just a drop in the sea because when you think about the importance some of the issues that we were talking about last night this last session we had about africa and his hypothetical fifty billion dollars destined for africa all of those not all half of those problems mentioned last night government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption giving voice to unheard to poor it 's why independent media is in business so from that perspective what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can we can now ours is just one story i 'm sure that in this room there are like fifteen other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work here is where the problem is to you as as well as i can imagine that this third of this room imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations now imagine that every second person over here is deaf and switch the lights off now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room so we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform to totally rethink instead of people running in this dark trying to find their own match who will be willing who has the same goals instead of all of that we thought there is something new needs to be and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds press freedom bonds if there are investors willing to finance u s why wouldn 't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit we will issue them probably in denominations of one thousand dollars i don 't want to advertise them too much that 's not the point but the point is if we ever survive to actually issue them find enough investors that this can be considered a success there 's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next iqbal quadir can issue his now we do daydreaming in eleven thirty but you can actually bring it to europe too you can once you have more than ten of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix what do investors get on one side financial on the other side social so that brings the idea of some kind of of rating agency now take it to the last step once you have all of that put together there 's not one reason why you couldn 't actually have a marketplace for all of that where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way and in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms no blind people running around to find each other"
