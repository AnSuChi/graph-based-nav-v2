  "transcript": "but how did they think one natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought our ability to imagine to be another possibility is that the social transformations that have shaped our culture but is this question even amenable to science here i 'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient greek cities looked just based on a few bricks that the writings of a culture doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient books of human culture julian jaynes came in the ' 70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis that only three thousand years ago humans were what today we would call schizophrenics and he made this claim based on the fact that the first humans described in these books behaved consistently in different traditions and in different places of the world as if they and obeying voices so jaynes 's theory is that consciousness at least in the way we perceive it today where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence so the question is whether the theory that introspection built up in human history only about three thousand years ago can be examined in a quantitative and objective manner and the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious it 's not like plato woke up one day and then he wrote hello i 'm plato and as of today i have a fully introspective consciousness the word introspection does not appear a single time so our way to solve this is to build the space of words this is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them indicative of how closely related they are another possibility is following the simple assumption that when two words are related they tend to appear in the same sentences in the same paragraphs in the same documents and this simple hypothesis turns out to be quite effective and just to give you a flavor of how well this works this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words the body parts the computer parts the scientific terms and so on so for instance you can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms and then there are very fine things for instance the word astronomy which seems a bit bizarre where it is is actually exactly where it should be between what it is the astronomical terms and we could go on and on with this actually if you stare at this for a while and you just build random trajectories and the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection or of the history of any concept which before could seem abstract and somehow vague becomes concrete becomes amenable to quantitative science and we take this stream of words as a trajectory and then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time and with this we could analyze the history of introspection in the ancient greek tradition for which we have the best available written record so what we did is we took all the books we just ordered them by time and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection and we just average that and then we ask whether as time goes on and this is exactly what happens but about four centuries before christ this starts ramping up very rapidly to an almost five fold increase of books getting closer and closer and closer to the concept of introspection and one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true in a different independent tradition and then we get the peak of introspection in the confessions of saint augustine about four centuries and this was very important so our algorithm which has the virtue and of course of being extremely fast it just runs in a fraction of a second can capture some of the most important conclusions which is that now this idea can be translated maybe the most challenging question we can pose to ourselves is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness to put it more precisely whether the words we say today can tell us something of where our our minds will be in a few days in a few months or a few years from now and in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate our respiration genes on the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases we tweet we email we write can tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong and with guillermo cecchi who has been my brother in this adventure we took on this task and we did so and then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict within a window of almost three years but despite our hopes we got failure after failure there was just not enough information in semantics to predict the future organization of the mind it was good enough to distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group but not to predict the future onset of psychosis but then we realized but how they were saying it and so we came up with this measure which we termed semantic coherence within one semantic category and it turned out to be that for this group of thirty four people the algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict with one hundred percent accuracy and this was something that could not be achieved not even close with all the remember vividly while i was working on this i was sitting at my computer and i saw a bunch of tweets by polo and there was something in this tweets i could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly but i got this strong hunch this strong intuition that something was going wrong and this simple fact that reading in between the lines his feelings was a simple but very effective way to help what i tell you today is that we 're getting close to understanding how we can convert this intuition that we quantitative and automated analysis of the words we write of the words we say"
