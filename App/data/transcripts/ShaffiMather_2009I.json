  "transcript": "anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year becoming a full time practicing lawyer my experiences over the last eighteen months as a lawyer has seeded in me a new so i share it with all of you here today though the idea itself is getting crystallized and i 'm still writing up the business plan of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed i 've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since one thousand nine hundred and ninety three along with my two brothers and then worked professionally with two of india 's biggest businessmen but in their startup enterprises i definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for profit solutions when life brought about a series of death and experiences within my close circle which highlighted the need founded ambulance access for all to promote life support ambulance services in india there is nothing absolutely nothing new in this idea providing world class life support ambulance service which is fully self sustainable from its own revenue streams irrespective of the capability to pay and has transported over one hundred thousand patients and victims since inception the service is fully self sustainable and the cross subsidy model actually works poor pays lower and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge the service responded effectively and efficiently during the unfortunate twenty six eleven mumbai terror attacks and as you can see from the visuals the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike we ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported one hundred and we have actually helped a pakistani ngo aman foundation to set up facilitated it 's a small message from us in our own small way to the enemies of humanity of islam irrespective of such and the other is moksha yug access which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of because diligent investors and venture funds have committed over seven point five million dollars in funding with the significance being now i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i 'm exploring corruption bribes and lack of transparency you may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless worsening the condition of the already worse off yet if you analyze the common man he or she does not wake up every day and say hmm let me see who i can pay a bribe to today or let me see who i can corrupt today often it is the constraining or the back to the wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe in the modern day world where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life now what do you do of course you can call the police but what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption expertise or wherewithal to fight this unfortunately and such a service simply do not exist one image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother seventy plus years being harassed by the bureaucrats yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe because i was busy building my real estate company i don 't want to be haunted by such images any more a group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address and in all forty two cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the right to information act audio or peer pressure we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe and with the cost of these tools being substantially lower than the bribe demanded i believe that these tools that worked in these forty two pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a bpo kind of environment and made available on web call center and franchise physical offices for a fee to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe or equal to india 's gdp and it is an absolutely virgin market i propose to explore this idea further to examine the potential of creating a corruption i do realize that the fight for justice against corruption through his charities i have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass and intimidation yet i believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place what gives us the courage as my close friend replied when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and trying to do an impossible task and an insane person does not know what an impossible task is somebody who the officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around three thousand rupees in bribes and and pushed back the officers when we kept pushing them back there was three kinds of reaction a set of people actually say just grant it to them and run away from it some people actually come back and say oh you want to screw me and then he relents by the what fee would you have to charge and can you actually make the business work sm well actually the cost that we incurred was less than two hundred rupees so it actually works ca that 's a high gross margin business i like thank you so much for sharing this idea"
