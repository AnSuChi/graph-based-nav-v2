  "transcript": "but i think robots can inspire us the home of bethlehem steel my father was an engineer like model rockets and slot cars and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were going to build a robot so i couldn 't wait to get they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals but it was so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and a few years later he was diagnosed with cancer and he died at the age of i was devastated by this and i never forgot the robot that he and i tried to build i decided to study engineering like him so what i 'd like to tell you about are four robot projects and how they how they 've inspired me to be a better human by one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i was a young professor at and this was the year the world wide web came out and we would we were just amazed we started playing with this we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the world and we called it the telegarden but we also set up some other software that lets you participate remotely and if you watered it a few times we 'd give you your own seed to plant now but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ars electronica museum in austria for almost nine years that robot was operated i got a call out of the blue who asked a very simple but profound question is the robot real because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot and the more i thought about it i couldn 't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference and i talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the skeptics and up through descartes the study of how do we know that something is true and we coined a new term telepistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the results are collected in this book from mit which is to always question assumptions as it was operating my students and i were very interested in how people were so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden like for example what if it could go to a dinner party because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface we decided that rather than have a robot replace the human we 'd have a human replace the robot we called it the tele actor someone who 's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet and the idea was that she could go so they could but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the so we got a chance to take the tele actor to the webby awards and that year sam donaldson was the host and people are watching her on their screens there 's cameras involved and and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that 's what i do and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips i asked how did the tele directors decide that they would give a kiss to sam donaldson and she said they hadn 't she when she was just about to walk onstage the tele directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural laughter so the success of the tele actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts improvise he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there 's a related treatment called as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all these needles are inserted in it 's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the needles so my students and i wondered what if we could modify so that the needles could come in so now we 're working with doctors at ucsf and engineers at johns hopkins and we 're building a robot and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets they 're aiming for when your path is blocked and this is and this is a commercially available device it 's being used in over two thousand hospitals around the world the idea is it allows many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and we 've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now has developed a new set of techniques so he 's gotten so we got one of these robots we started working with pieter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task with the robot so what we 're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so we record all these and then we apply kalman filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then what we do we observe the results adjust the controls again and here 's the result that 's the inferred task trajectory and here 's the robot moving at the and here 's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we 're able to get a robot to perform a delicate so this project if you want to do something well so these are four of the lessons that i 've learned from robots over the years but it 's very and now i have a daughter named odessa and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family laughter i wish she could meet my dad and i wonder what kind of lessons she 'll learn from them robots are the most human but i think they have something important to teach us i invite all of you to think about the innovations that you 're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what might be telling you because i have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans"
