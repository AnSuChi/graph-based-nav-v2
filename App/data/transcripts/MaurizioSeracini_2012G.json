  "transcript": "i met in florence a professor carlo pedretti my former and today a world renowned scholar he asked me if i could find some technological way to unfold a five centuries old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by leonardo da vinci the battle of anghiari which is supposed to be located and so i decided with some researchers from the united states and the university of florence to start probing the murals unfortunately at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking and it was only taken up in two thousand thanks to the and in order to do that we first created a and then with thermography we went on to discover hidden windows these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande and we managed to reconstruct therefore all the layout of this original hall including a staircase that that was very important in order to precisely place the battle of on a specific area who was commissioned to remodel the hall of the five hundred between one thousand five hundred and sixty we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap one that we [ see ] here masaccio the church of santa maria novella in florence so we just said well maybe visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci and so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for and we did find and well unfortunately in two thousand and four the project many political reasons so i decided to go back to my alma mater and the university of california san diego and i proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cisa3 as a research center for cultural heritage specifically art architecture and archaeology so students started to flow in and we started to build technologies because that 's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and go and do fieldwork we came back in the hall of the five hundred in two thousand and eleven and this time with a great group of students and my colleague professor falko kuester who is now the director at cisa3 and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish black color and there is some beige fragments that later on x ray diffraction and the results are very positive so far it seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before vasari came in about sixty years we are searching for the highest this is by far the most important commission that leonardo has ever had and for doing this great masterpiece he was named the number one artist influence at i had also had the privilege since the last thirty seven years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me but basically to do what well to assess for example the state of conservation see here the face of the madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another different lady aged lady i should rather say there is a lot of varnish still sitting there but if you take an x ray of the unicorn it with the scientific examination of this painting came out actually left the painting unfinished so all this writing about the the exotic symbol of the unicorn unfortunately is not very reliable just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art nice painting and just have an infrared camera peering through and luckily for art historians it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus it even says so that was a good result again authenticity and science could go together and change the way or i should rather say but i would say the discovery that really caught my imagination my admiration is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer brown layer of the adoration of the magi here you see a handmade setting xyz scanner with an infrared camera put on it and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath and they 're magnificent you see leonardo at work right finding i should rather say over seventy new images came out never seen for centuries we came to understand and to prove which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see so thanks only to if we all have this pleasure this privilege to see all this to find all these discoveries what about for everybody else so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet let me show you just in a museum environment so let 's say that we go to a museum with a tablet okay and we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see and now and so see we can as we said we can zoom in then we can scroll okay let 's go and all we need is one finger just wipe off and we see the elephant and then if we want we can continue the scroll to find out for example on the staircase the whole iconography is going to be changed and there are a lot of figures showing up see the meaning of the painting and we believe this is a cool way easy way that everybody could have access to to become more the protagonist of your own and not just be so passive about it as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums another concept is which sounds very and the technique materials and also if when and why we should restore or rather to intervene on on the environment our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance create a new discipline where engineering we definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work especially today"
