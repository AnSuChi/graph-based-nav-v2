  "transcript": "and if you 're in and the problem is this the numbers tell the story quite clearly one hundred and ninety heads of state nine are women thirteen percent are women in the corporate sector women at the top c level jobs board seats tops out at fifteen sixteen percent the numbers have not moved since two thousand and two and are going in the wrong direction and even in the non profit world a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women women at the top twenty percent which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment a recent study in the u s showed that of married senior managers two thirds of the married men had children and only one third of the married women had children a couple of years ago i and i realized he doesn 't know where the women 's room is in his office so i start looking around for moving boxes figuring they just moved in but i don 't see any and so i said did you just move into this office and he said no we 've been here about a year and i said are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year or maybe you 're the only one who had to go to the bathroom so the question is how are we going to fix this how do we change i want to start out by saying i talk about this about keeping women in the workforce because i really think that 's the answer in the high income part of our workforce in the people who end up at the top fortune five hundred ceo jobs or the equivalent in other industries the problem i am convinced is that women are dropping now people talk about this a lot and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women i want to talk about none of that today even though that 's all really important what are the messages we need to tell ourselves what are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us what are the messages we tell our daughters now at the outset i left san francisco where i live on monday and i was getting on the plane for this conference and my daughter who 's three when i dropped her off at preschool did that whole hugging the leg crying mommy don 't get on the plane thing whether they 're at home or whether they 're in the workforce who don 't feel that sometimes so i 'm not saying that staying in the workforce and i think there are three sit at the table two make your partner a real partner number one sit at the table just a couple weeks ago at facebook we hosted a very senior government official and he came in to meet with senior and i kind of said to them sit at the table and they sat on the side of the room when i was in college my senior year i took a course called european intellectual history don 't you love that kind of thing from college i and i took it with my roommate carrie who was then a brilliant literary student and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar and my brother smart guy but a marches and we sit there for three hours and our little blue notebooks we walk out we look at each other and we say how did you do and carrie says boy i feel like i didn 't really draw out the main point on the hegelian dialectic and i say god i really wish i had really connected john locke 's theory of property with the philosophers that follow and my brother says i got the top grade in the class you got the top grade in the class you don 't know anything the problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows women systematically underestimate their own abilities if you test men and women and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like gpas men get it wrong slightly high and women get it wrong slightly low women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce a study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that fifty seven percent of boys entering or men i guess are negotiating their first salary and only seven percent of women and most importantly if you ask men why they did a good job they 'll say because no one gets to the corner office and no one gets the i wish i could go tell all the young women i work for these fabulous women believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself own your own success i wish i could tell that to my daughter but it which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture he changed exactly one word thought heidi and howard were equally competent and that 's good the bad news was that everyone liked howard he 's a great guy you want to work for him you want to spend the day fishing with him but heidi not so sure she 's a little out for herself she 's a little political you 're not sure you 'd want to work for her this is the complication we have to tell our daughters and our colleagues we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the a to reach for the and we have to do it in a world where for them there are sacrifices they will make for that even though for their brothers there are not i gave this talk at facebook not so long ago to about one hundred employees and a couple hours later there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk i said okay and she sat down and we talked and she said i learned something today i learned that i need to keep my hand up what do you mean she said you 're giving this talk and you said you would take two more questions and i noticed all the women did the same and then you only from the men if it 's me who cares about this obviously giving this talk and during this talk i can 't even notice how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women we 've got to get women to sit at the table number two make your partner a real partner i 've become convinced that we 've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home the data shows this very clearly if a woman and a man work full time and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does so she 's got three jobs or two jobs and he 's got one who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more i think as a society because we have to make it as important a job because it 's the hardest job in the world studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility and if that wasn 't good enough motivation for everyone out there they also have more how shall i say this on this stage they know each other more in the biblical sense as well message number three don 't leave before you leave i think there 's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking and i see this all the time with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving and she starts thinking about having a child and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child she starts thinking about making room for that child how am i going to fit this into everything else i 'm doing and literally from that moment the problem is that let 's say she got pregnant that day that day nine months of pregnancy three months of maternity leave six months to catch your breath years more often and as i 've seen it women start thinking about this way earlier when they get engaged or married when they start thinking about having a child which can take a long time one woman came to see me about this she looked a little young and i said so are you and your husband thinking about having a baby and she said oh no i 'm not married she everyone who 's been through this and i 'm here to tell you once you have a child at home your job better be really good to go back because it 's hard to leave that kid at home your job needs to be challenging it needs to be rewarding and if two years ago you didn 't take a promotion and some guy next to you did if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities you 're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal don 't leave before you leave stay in keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day you need to particularly ones you 're not even conscious you 're making my generation really sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top they 're just not moving we are not going to get to where fifty percent of the population but i 'm hopeful that future generations can i think a world where half of our countries it 's not just because people would know where the women 's bathrooms are even though i want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home thank you"
