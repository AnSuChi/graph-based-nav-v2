  "transcript": "i 'm a cancer doctor and i walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital and so as a cancer doctor you look at this and you get a little bit downhearted but when you start to read the article by cliff who himself is a cancer survivor who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from new york city to upstate new york to get an and the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology in our view of cancer and this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that obviously we 've made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease and then go out of my comfort zone and tell you where i think it 's going where a new approach that we hope to because this is wrong they stick a needle in they way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern this is a normal cell there 's no fancy looking at the chromosomes this and how we do it we can prevent most cancers you know the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease we could do the same in cancer company called navigenics where if you spit into a tube and we can look look at thirty five or forty genetic all of which are delayable in many of the cancers you start to identify because the problem is when you have advanced cancer we can 't do that much today about it as the statistics allude to because evolution doesn 't care about us after we 've had our children see evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then after age thirty five or forty or forty five it said it doesn 't matter because they 've had their progeny so if you look at cancers it is very rare extremely rare to have cancer in a child and that 's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer but if we start to understand that cancer isn 't just a molecular defect it 's something more then we 'll get as i 'll show you so one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that right now we describe it by a number of adjectives you then have some anatomic descriptions you get that ct scan there 's a three centimeter mass in the liver you then have some body part descriptions it 's in the liver in the breast in the prostate and that 's about it so our dictionary for describing and they 've allocated another billion dollars to what we call the cancer genome atlas project so it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer and giving us a new lexicon they started to describe cancer by body part that hasn 't changed in over one hundred and fifty it is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate by breast so hopefully we will go from being the art of medicine and then say this antibiotic makes sense because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it when one is exposed to because we know what you have and we know how to treat it the cancer genome atlas is coming out now the first cancer was was done which was brain cancer you 'll see ovarian cancer and then lung cancer will come several months after but remember i 'm not pushing to be a reductionist and there 's a very important distinction there that we 'll get to we spend most of the dollars in terms of treating disease if you could start to move that to identify what you 're up against we can take it enormously the other direction and obviously that 's where we need to go going forward so the website of the national cancer institute says that cancer is a genetic disease and that is cancer it 's a liver with colon cancer in it and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded you see a ct scan where cancer is in the liver cancer is an interaction of a cell the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer and i think that 's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades is that we have strived to understand cancer the goal is to control cancer and that is a very different optimization scheme a very different strategy for all of us i got up at the american association of cancer research one of the big cancer research meetings with twenty thousand people there and i said we 've made a mistake we 've all made a mistake myself included by focusing down by being a reductionist we need to take a step back and believe it or not there were hisses in the audience people got upset but this is the only way we 're going to go forward you know i was very fortunate to meet and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other but people prevailed on us and we got together and it 's been transformative in what i do absolutely transformative we have designed and we have worked on the modeling and much of these ideas came from danny and from his team the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system the key is when you look at these variables and you look at this data you have to understand the data inputs you know if i measured your temperature i would say great so one of the problems the fundamental problems in medicine is that you we have discrete data elements we don 't have a time function on them but because it looks over and i didn 't realize that for three hours i 'm sitting at my desk and i 'm not moving at all and a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really if you think of cancer there 's an input and an output and a state the genetic mutations the output are our symptoms etc most of that state is hidden so what we do in our field is we change and input we give etc but when you start to put them together in a complex and that brain can create intelligence the good news is you can manipulate them you can try to control them without that fundamental understanding of every component pre menopausal with breast cancer so about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get and then they randomized them where half got placebo and half got a drug called zoledronic acid that they looked and in these one thousand eight hundred women given twice a year a drug that builds bone you reduce the recurrence of cancer by so the notion you change the soil but the doses if i give a woman with breast cancer a drug called taxol every three weeks which is the standard about forty percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug and a response is fifty percent shrinkage well remember that 's not even an order of magnitude but that 's a different i give them that same drug every week i give them that same drug over ninety six hours by continuous infusion another twenty or thirty percent will respond it 's not we have no idea the mechanism so the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence chemotherapy may work by that same exact way the wild thing about that trial the problem is yours and mine all of our systems are changing but if you start to look at it that red that dark color there more than seventy five percent of the population of those countries are obese look a decade markedly different which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this and each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified the power of these magnets the power of what we can do here is that we see an individual neutron with this technology so and we can start to look at that system like we never have before so instead of a reductionist view we 're taking a step back who had recurrent she had gotten carboplatin taxol carboplatin taxotere every drug we have she had gotten and that disease continued to grow she had three kids under the age of twelve and this is her ct scan and so what this is and you can see in the middle there is her heart and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her untreated in a matter of weeks she goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway and a month later pow that cancer 's gone but she got three years from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne that and we were a part of it would you want your mother your brother your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live and the answer obviously is not so it was done on this group of patients ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here how do i know patients actually benefited from the drug so the morning the fda was going to meet this was the editorial in the wall street journal and so what do you know that drug was approved the amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial where they gave half placebo and half the drug and we learned something important there what 's interesting is they did it in south america and canada where it 's more ethical to give placebos they had to give it also in the u s to get approval so i think there were three u s patients in upstate new york who were part of the trial but they did that and what they found is that seventy percent lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo the problem is that if did that drug help you or not that 's where these new technologies and so the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor 's office right the ultimate goal is is that you prevent any of these things from happening that is the most effective the way we 've approached the problem with technologies like this so there 's no technology in the world that can span eleven orders of earlier was talked about cross discipline and i think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in yesterday the national cancer institute announced a new program mathematicians are brought in to think about cancer people who never approached it before danny and i got sixteen million dollars they announced yesterday to try to attach this problem instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by to try to bring technology to get a picture of what 's actually happening just for two seconds how these technologies work because i think it 's important to understand it and then there 's a detector at the end when it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and so we can accurately if the magnet is big enough and your resolution is high enough you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding instead of having paper where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease and certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter we need to start to think differently and radically and so i implore everyone here here think differently come up with new ideas tell them to me or anyone else in our field you know andy grove stepped down as chairman of the board at intel and andy was one of my mentors tough individual when andy stepped down he said no technology will win technology itself will win and i 'm a firm believer in the field of medicine and especially cancer that it 's going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in
