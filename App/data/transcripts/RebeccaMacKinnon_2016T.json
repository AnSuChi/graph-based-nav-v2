  "transcript": "there 's a big question at the center of life in our democracies today how do we fight terror without destroying democracies without trampling human rights i 've spent much of my career working with journalists with bloggers with activists and i 've come to the conclusion that if our democratic societies do not double down radical extremist so five years later they 're struggling with serious terror attacks and rampant isis recruitment and many tunisians are calling on their government to do whatever it takes to keep them safe tunisian cartoonist nadia khiari i don 't give a damn about the revolution i just want to be safe satisfied asked his jailer you 're safe now if the tunisian people can figure out how to deal with their terrorism problem without ending up in but for all of us the reality is that civil society journalists and activists are coming under attack from extremist groups on the one hand and in many countries also from their own governments we 're seeing bloggers and journalists being jailed charged and intimidated by their own governments many of which are allies with the west in the war on terror just three examples a friend and former colleague of mine has been charged with threatening state security along with six other activists in morocco the saudi blogger raif badawi has been jailed and flogged for insulting islam and criticizing the because he and some other activists have been supporting kurdish media anti terror measures quickly turn into state repression without strong protection for minority communities and for peaceful debate this independent local media but while that 's not really happening washington is teaming up with silicon valley and with hollywood to pour millions hundreds of millions of dollars into what 's called a fancy word for to counter the terrorist propaganda spreading all over the internet monitoring and censorship completely fails to make up for the fact that the people social and political problems in their community that are causing people to to turn to extremism in the first place are being silenced by their own governments the human rights organization and this is not just because of the actions of authoritarian governments it 's also because democratic governments are increasingly cracking down un secretary general ban ki moon has warned that preventing extremism and promoting human rights go hand in hand it 's not to say that governments shouldn 't keep us safe of course they should transparency and accountability to the rule of law thirteen in bangladesh over a dozen secular bloggers and community activists have been literally slaughtered by extremists while the government has done very little ruqia hassan and naji jerf have been assassinated for their reporting out of yet authorities in countries like the united states the united kingdom and many other democracies are seeking to use the law to either weaken or outright ban strong because the bad guys are using it too kudos to the companies that are standing up for their users ' right to use encryption youtube and twitter are among the many companies who report having taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of content and deactivating accounts that are connected the problem is their enforcement mechanisms are a complete black box and there is collateral damage iyad last december a number of women named isis which also happens to be the name of an egyptian goddess had their accounts deactivated but that 's the thing she had to get media attention and journalists aren 't immune david thomson an expert on terrorism and reporter for radio france international had reports deleted from his facebook account and had his account deactivated for several days because they contained pictures of isis flags even though he was just reporting on isis not promoting it ahmed abdellahy who reported recently in an event in washington dc that some of his arguments with extremists he now spends his time on social media arguing with isis followers trying to get them to turn away some of his arguments with these extremists get deleted which he believes has the effect of shielding them from alternative points of view it 's unclear whether facebook even knows the extent of the collateral damage or the other they need to be held accountable they need to carry out impact assessment to identify and fix the problems that we 're clearly seeing they need to be more transparent about their enforcement mechanisms and they need to have clear appeal and grievance mechanisms so people can get their content reinstated now i 've been talking for the last ten minutes about how governments and companies are making it more difficult for people like these this is a picture of members of the citizen media network global voices that i helped to cofound over ten years ago with my friend ethan the data scientist gilad lotan and he found that many of these people served as key information nodes between activists and journalists throughout the tunisian and but are able to continue to thrive many of them are still active other than the ones who have gone to jail or have been driven into hiding or exile all around the world we 've got to do everything we can to push our governments and companies to do a also if you follow the news it 's pretty clear that that alone isn 't going to be enough we 've got to take personal responsibility by joining or at very least supporting we can overcome the digitally empowered networks of but we 've got to do this by really beefing up and taking personal risk for a future world that is more peaceful just open and free thanks very much for"
