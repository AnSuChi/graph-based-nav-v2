  "transcript": "what 's the fastest growing threat to americans ' health every sixty seven seconds someone in the united states is diagnosed with alzheimer 's will become an overwhelming societal challenge my family has experienced firsthand the struggles of caring for an alzheimer 's patient growing up in a family with three generations i 've always been very close to my grandfather it was one of the scariest moments i 've ever experienced but couldn 't find one i was looking after my grandfather and i saw him stepping out of the bed once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver so now i 'd like to perform a demonstration of this sock so once so this is a drawing of my preliminary design my desire to create a sensor based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology when i was six i became concerned about my own grandparents and decided to invent a smart bathroom system motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom but nonetheless my research experience really implanted in me a firm desire to use sensors to help the elderly people i really believe that sensors can improve the quality of life of the elderly creating a sensor second designing a circuit and third coding a smartphone app this made me realize that my project was actually much harder to realize i initially had thought it to be i decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive therefore i could design a circuit that would measure lastly i had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform the care giver 's smartphone into a remote monitor integrating these components i was able to successfully create two prototypes one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock last summer i was able to beta test my device at several residential care facilities in california and i 'm currently incorporating the feedback to further improve the device into a marketable product so sensor data collected on a vast number of patients can be useful for improving patient care and also leading to a cure for the disease possibly one thing i 'll never forget is when my device first caught my grandfather 's wandering out of bed at night at that moment i was really struck by the power of technology to change lives for the better people living happily and healthfully that 's the world that i imagine thank you very much"
