  "transcript": "sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages i am going to try to convince you in the fifteen minutes i have that microbes have a lot to say about questions such and they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system but also maybe beyond and this is why i am tracking them down in the most impossible places on earth in extreme environments where conditions are really pushing them to the brink of survival actually sometimes me too when i 'm trying to follow them too close but here 's the thing we are the only advanced civilization in the solar system but that doesn 't mean that there is no microbial life nearby in fact the planets and moons you see here could host life all of them and we know that and if we were going to find life on those moons and planets then we would answer questions such as are we alone in the solar system and we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution in our understanding of what a habitable planet is and today a habitable planet is a planet that has a zone where water can stay stable but to me this is a horizontal definition of habitability because it involves a distance to a star but there is another dimension to habitability and this is a vertical dimension think of it as conditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away which for some of them means food and a protection very far away deep in the ocean you have life thriving and it uses only chemistry so when you think of it and if you have been looking at the and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on enceladus our solar system is turning into a giant spa for anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that right but it might still be hiding underground so we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability but we also have been making progress in our understanding of what the signatures of life are on earth and you can have what we call organic and you can minerals biominerals which is due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks and of course you can have gases in the atmosphere and when you look at those tiny green algae on the right of the slide here and you know it 's getting worse because we won 't be able to find the physical evidence of where we are coming from on this and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone all record is gone erased by plate tectonics and erosion this is what i call the earth 's biological horizon beyond this horizon we don 't know where we are coming from so is everything lost well maybe not and we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place so clearly those two planets may have been seeded by the same material but that also means that we can go to mars and try to find traces of our own origin mars may hold that secret for us this is why mars is so special to us but for that to happen mars needed to be habitable at the time when conditions were right so was mars habitable we have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today and this picture tells us something not necessarily then everything went south for mars the atmosphere was stripped away so if we want to be able to understand if we want to be able to find those traces of the signatures of life at the surface of mars are there we need to understand what was the impact of each of these events on the preservation of its record only then will we be able to know where those signatures are hiding and only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places where we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something really important easy right well geologists are using it to go back in the past of our own planet i am using it a little bit differently i use planet earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of mars at the time when the climate changed and there i 'm trying to understand what happened what are the signatures of life what is left how are we going to find it so for one moment now i 'm going to take you with me on a trip into that time machine but in fact we are less than a billion years after the earth and mars formed minerals and the other thing about those sites is that exactly like on mars three and a half billion years ago the climate is changing very fast and water and ice are disappearing but we need to go back to that time when everything changed on mars and to do that we need to go higher basically you are getting to those conditions on mars so i was not promising anything about trip on the time machine you are not going to be sitting in that time machine you have to haul one thousand pounds of equipment to the summit of this 20 000 foot volcano in the andes here but when we get to the summit we actually find the lake we came for and now we have to change our voyage into an inner voyage inside that lake and to do that we have to remove our mountain gear and actually don suits and go for it and then we are going to get the answer came for but everything else this picture is very deceiving but like in many places on earth right now and due to climate change there is a huge loss in biodiversity in the samples that we took back home thirty six percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species and those three species are the ones that have survived so far right next the first one the red color you see here is not due to minerals it 's actually due to the presence of a tiny algae in this region during u v storms there the u v index reaches forty three spf thirty is not going to do anything to you over there and they go underground well they are actually living inside rocks and they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks to get the good part of the u v and discard the part that could and this is why we are taking our rover to train them to search for life on mars in these areas because if there was life on mars three and a half billion it had to use the same strategy to actually protect itself it is pretty obvious that going to extreme environments is helping us very much for the exploration of mars and to prepare missions but also its habitability our most recent rover on mars has discovered traces of organics yeah there are organics at the surface of mars and it also discovered traces of methane and we don 't know yet if the methane in question is really regardless what we know is that because of the discovery the hypothesis that there is still life present on mars today remains a viable one so by now i think i have convinced you but it would be a mistake to think that mars is the only place in the solar system that is interesting to find potential microbial life and the reason is because mars and the earth could have a common root to their it 's not that easy celestial mechanics is not making it so easy for an exchange of material between planets and so if we were to discover or it can be many trees of life in it is going to give us a standard by if somebody tells you that looking for alien microbes is not cool because you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them let me show you why and how you can tell them they 're wrong well organic material is going to tell you about environment about complexity and about or any information carrier is going to tell you about adaptation about evolution about survival about planetary changes and about the transfer of information all together they are telling us what started as a microbial pathway and why what started as a microbial pathway sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end but only one has achieved there is a very very powerful message microbes are and they are telling us about diversity they are telling us about abundance of life and they are telling us how this life has survived thus far to reach civilization intelligence"
