  "transcript": "one of the things i want to establish right from the start is that and i follow a long tradition neurosurgery comes from a long tradition it 's been around for about there used to be neurosurgery and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat and they were trying to they knew that the brain was involved in neurological and psychiatric disease they didn 't know exactly what they were doing not much has changed by the way they thought that if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit so if you are possessed by an evil spirit causing neurologic or psychiatric problems so this was the thinking back then and sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because you can tell that the holes are made partially and then i think there was some trepanation and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial there were some sites where one percent of all the skulls have these holes and so you can see that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common and it was also quite common now in the course of time we 've come to realize that and when things work well then the nervous system works well and everything functions but once in a while things don 't go so well and there 's trouble in these circuits and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring and causing trouble or sometimes they 're underactive and they 're not quite working as they should now the manifestation of this depends on where so what we 've been able to do is to pinpoint where these disturbances are in the and we 've been able to intervene within these circuits in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down so this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio so what i 'm going to tell you about is using so what we 're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain again we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime putting an electrode in and then this electrode is completely underneath the skin down to a pacemaker in the chest and with a remote control very much like a control we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain we can turn it up or down on or off so this looks something like this when it 's in the brain you see the electrode going through the skull into the brain and resting there and we can place this really anywhere in the brain i tell my friends that no neuron is safe from a neurosurgeon because we can really reach just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now now the first example i 'm going to show you is a patient with parkinson 's disease and this lady has parkinson 's disease and she has these electrodes in her brain so this looks something like this the electrodes are turned off now and you can see that she has tremor and the difference between shaking in this way and not the difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of twenty five thousand neurons in her subthalamic nucleus so in this case we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons so here he is first the right foot then the and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted progressively disabled and many of these children do not survive so he is one of five kids the only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this we did not know what operation to do where to go in the brain but on the basis of our results in parkinson 's disease we reasoned why don 't we try to suppress the same area in the brain that we suppressed in we did not know and here he is this boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life this has been one of the most satisfying cases that i have ever done in my entire career to restore movement and walking to this kind of we realized that perhaps we could use this technology not only in circuits that control your movement but also circuits that control other things and the next thing that we took on was circuits that control your mood and what we did was pet scans look at the blood flow of the brain and what we noticed is that in patients with depression compared to normals and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation in drive and decision making and indeed if you 're severely depressed as these patients were those are impaired you lack motivation and drive and the other areas of the brain involved in and the frontal lobes are shut down in we have a complete reversal of this we 're able to drive down area twenty five and this may become a new procedure if it 's safe and we find that it 's effective to treat patients with severe depression i 've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation to can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter laughter anybody interested in that we can right so what we 've decided to do is we 're going to try to turbocharge the memory circuits in the brain we now we 're not going to do this in normal which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory and whether that can in turn help these patients with alzheimer 's disease the brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose it uses twenty percent of all your even though it only weighs two percent it uses ten times more glucose than it should based on its weight twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose they shut down they turn off and indeed what we see is that these areas in red around the outside ribbon of the brain are progressively getting more and more blue until they shut down completely this is analogous to having a power failure in an area of the brain a regional power failure so the lights are out in parts of the brain in patients with alzheimer 's disease and indeed at the top you 'll see before the surgery we then put in the dbs electrodes and we wait for a month or a year and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization and indeed we are able to get these areas of the brain and we 're able to turn the power back we are going to operate on fifty patients with early alzheimer 's disease to see whether this is safe and effective whether we can improve their neurologic function there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states we are now learning to understand what are the circuits what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical we can graduate the activity of those circuits we can turn them the implications of this of course and this is something for the future to see if indeed so i envision that we 're going to see a great expansion of indications of this technique we one of the most exciting things about this is that indeed it involves work it involves the work of engineers of imaging scientists of basic scientists of neurologists psychiatrists neurosurgeons and certainly at the interface and the consequence of that of course will be that we will be able to help many more patients"
