  "transcript": "but regardless of the format two of my favorite materials glass depiction of a lotus blossom but a closer look at this lotus reveals each petal to be the cross section of a slave ship this iconic diagram was taken from a british slaving manual and later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery but by using this buddhist symbol i hope to universalize and transcend the history and trauma of black america and encourage discussions about our shared past to create lotus we carved over six thousand figures and this later led to a commission by the city of new york to create a 28 foot version in steel as a permanent installation at the eagle academy for young men a school for black and latino students the two groups most affected by this history i 've been collecting wooden african figures from tourist shops and flea markets around the only recently have i figured out how to use this in my own work gun since two thousand and twelve the world has witnessed the killings of who frequently walk away with no punishment at all i created this body of work simply entitled it was important to erase the identity of each of these figures to make them all look the same and easier to disregard to do this i dip them in a thick brown wax before taking them to a shooting range where i re sculpted them using bullets somehow feeling as if i would be shooting myself i then took the fragments of these and created molds and cast them first in wax when i showed this work recently in miami a woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul but she also felt that these artworks while showing in berlin last year a philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings i showed him a photo of a lynching postcard i hope my artwork creates a safe space for this type of honest exchange and an opportunity for people to engage one another in real and necessary conversation"
