  "transcript": "you might be wondering why i 'm wearing sunglasses so we all think we know what glamour is here it is it 's glamorous movie stars like marlene drive drink you know he drinks wine there actually is a little wine in there but i think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters but also comes in other forms a magazine this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand it 's all about sex tips bourke white 's one of her pictures she did fantastic glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places and there 's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur hewlett packard grand unification and this is very very because for centuries glamour had a very particular meaning and the word was actually used differently from the way we think it wasn 't glamour as a quality you cast a glamour glamour was a literal magic spell not a metaphorical one the way we use it today but celtic magic deception this definition for any artificial interest in or association with an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified glamour is an illusion glamour is a magic spell well of course in the 20th century glamour came to have this different meaning associated with hollywood and this is hedy lamarr hedy lamarr said anyone can look glamorous all you have to do is sit there and look stupid but in fact with all due respect to hedy about whom we 'll hear more later there 's a lot more to it there was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this hollywood glamour there were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make up experts you can go to the museum of hollywood history in hollywood and see max factor 's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up so you 've got this highly stylized portrait of something that glamour is a form but falsification to achieve a particular purpose it process of idealization glorification and dramatization and it 's not just the case for people glamour doesn 't have to be people architectural photography julius schulman who has talked about transfiguration took this it puts this is alex ross 's comic book art which appears to be extremely realistic as part of his style is he this is filippino lippi 's and i don 't know who she is either but this is the [ 16th ] century equivalent of a supermodel it 's a very glamorous portrait why is it glamorous because she is beautiful but that does not make you glamorous that only makes you beautiful she is graceful she is mysterious and she is transcendent and those are the central qualities of glamour you don 't see her eyes they 're looking downward she 's not looking away from you exactly but you have to mentally imagine her world she 's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture mel gibson 's passion mysterious a little bit distant that 's why often in these glamour shots the person is not looking at the audience it 's why so as i say in religious art you know god is not glamorous god cannot be glamorous because god is omnipotent omniscient too far above us and yet you will see in religious art saints or the virgin mary will often be portrayed not always in glamorous forms glamour does not have to be about people one thing about superman is he makes you believe that a man can and this is one reason that but you can 't do a glamorized picture of traffic you can do a glamorized picture of an the notion is that it 's going to transport you and the story is not about you know the guy in front of you in the airplane who has this nasty little kid or the big cough and this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling but because i happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because to me it captures the whole promise of the skylines are super glamorous the horizon the open road is very very glamorous there are few things more glamorous than the horizon except possibly you just see the possibilities in order to pull glamour off you need this renaissance quality of sprezzatura which is a term coined by castiglione in his it makes things look effortless you don 't think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress she just looks completely after the lara croft movies how angelina jolie would go home completely black and blue of course they covered that with make up because lara croft did all those same stunts but she doesn 't get black and blue because she has sprezzatura to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour glamour is about editing how do you create the sense of transcendence the sense of evoking a perfect world the sense of you know this is underneath jeff 's this is what the real world of computers lamps electrical appliances of all kinds looks like but if you look in a catalog particularly a catalog of modern beautiful but there 's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp you will live in a world without cords and the same thing is true of if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer and there she is grace this is the most glamorous picture i think ever part of the thing is that in rear window the question is is she too glamorous to live in his world and the answer is no but of course it 's really just a movie here 's hedy lamarr and you know this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because like sunglasses it conceals and reveals at the same time translucence is glamorous that 's why and i think if grace kelly is the most glamorous person maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous it has that sense of going and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were particularly going down and of course glass block has that sense of translucence translucence so this session 's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour 's really partly about meaning all individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized in reality they have contradictions they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other whatever it is and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals and the way we deal with that is we the perfect kitchen no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen you know you buy that viking range this is what your kitchen will look like the perfect love life symbolized by the perfect the perfect getaway in your perfect car this is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia the perfect office again no cords as far as i can tell and certainly no it doesn 't look a thing like my office i mean there 's no paper on the desk we want this golden world and some people get rich enough and if they have their ideals in a sort of domestic sense dean koontz built this fabulous home theater which is i don 't think accidentally in art deco style that symbolizes this sense because what is your perfect world what is your ideal and also what has been edited out is it something important it was criticized for glamorizing violence because look sunglasses and those long coats bourke white photo this is from soviet union attractive i mean look how happy the people are and because this is from triumph of the will brilliant editing to cut together things and the west and the world and ridding it of anything and there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it and that 's to take isaac mizrahi 's advice and confront the manipulation of it all and sort of admit that that manipulation is something that we enjoy but also enjoy how it happens and here 's hedy lamarr she 's very glamorous but you know she invented"
