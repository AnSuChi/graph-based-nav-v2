  "transcript": "i want to tell you the story about the time i almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red mazda miata it 's the day after graduating from design school and i 'm having a yard sale and this guy pulls up in this red mazda driving cross country on a road trip so i invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world i make the mistake of asking him so where are you staying tonight and he makes it worse by saying actually i don 't have a place he 's going to the peace corps but i don 't really know if he 's going to the peace corps and i don 't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a miata that 's a small trunk so then i hear myself saying hey i have an airbed you can stay on in my living room and the voice in my head goes wait what i 'm staring at the ceiling and thinking what have i done there 's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room what if he 's psychotic it turns out he was and it completely changed my perspective maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers the idea i brought the airbed with me and then the rent goes up and then i learn there 's a design conference coming to town and all the hotels are sold out and i 've always believed that turning fear into fun so here 's what i pitch my best friend and my new roommate brian chesky ha we built a basic website and airbed and breakfast was born three lucky guests got to stay on a the ham and swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests brian and i just stared at each other did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making the wheels had started to turn my old roommate nate blecharczyk joined co founder and we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business here 's what we pitched investors we want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces their bedrooms the bathrooms it 's going to be huge it did not no one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people 's homes when you 're faced with a problem you fall back on what you know and all we really knew was design we learned to do that for objects but here we were aiming to build olympic trust between people who had never met could design make that happen is it possible to design for trust i 've got a 30 second experiment that will push you past your comfort now that you have your phone out i 'd like you to unlock your phone now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left tiny sense of panic you 're feeling right now because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home people don 't just see your messages they see your bedroom your kitchen your toilet now how does it feel holding someone 's unlocked phone most of us feel really responsible that 's how most guests feel and it 's because of this that our company can even exist by the way who 's holding al gore 's phone would you tell twitter he 's running for president ok you can hand your phones back now i 'd love to share a few discoveries we 've made along the way imagine that they had one hundred and fifty reviews of people saying they 're great at holding unlocked phones and we didn 't actually get it right the first time we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them where we looked at people 's willingness to trust someone the research showed not surprisingly we prefer people who are like us the more different somebody is the less we trust them but if you 've got more than ten high reputation beats high similarity now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure this is what happens when a guest first messages a host if you share too little acceptance rates go down and if you share too much like i 'm having issues with my mother but there 's a zone that 's just right like love the artwork in your place coming for vacation with my family so how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing we bet our whole company what we didn 't realize is just how many people a graph that shows our rate of adoption the first an unbelievable amount of luck things have been going pretty well obviously there are times when things don 't work out guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes hosts have left guests stranded in the rain and it hurts to even think about them thankfully out of the one hundred and twenty three million nights we 've ever hosted turns out people are justified in their trust and when trust works out it can be absolutely magical the host rushed him to the hospital they donated their own blood for his operation let me read you his review excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial the area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals javier and alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you they will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you 're dying they don and they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you highly recommended but this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for but if you just called it the rental economy it would be incomplete the sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection people share a part of themselves i think of it like fast food what if anywhere you visited there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn 't even know existed or learning to cook from the chef of a five star restaurant what if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up what would that look like i see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection they 're connecting students who need a place to live with and they 've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start ups tonight just on our service seven hundred and eighty five thousand people in one hundred and clearly it 's not as crazy as we were taught hospitality has been around forever there 's been many other websites like ours so why did ours eventually take off i 've learned that you can take the components of trust and you can design for that and that 's amazing thank you"
