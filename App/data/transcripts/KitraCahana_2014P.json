  "transcript": "i know a man who soars above the city every night even a body as paralyzed as his own this man i walked into his room in the icu at the montreal neurological institute and found him lying deathly still tethered to a breathing machine and stopped he never lost consciousness he watched from within as his body shut down limb by limb muscle by muscle i began reciting the alphabet a then at t don 't cry this is a blessing there was no audible voice but my father called out my name powerfully despite his extreme physical state he was completely present with me and being my father as much if not more than ever before locked in syndrome is many people 's worst nightmare in french it 's sometimes called falling in love with life and body anew as a rabbi and spiritual man dangling between mind and body life and death the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him he realized he no longer needed to look beyond the corporeal world in order to find the divine understanding the deep human psychological fear of not being able to call out for help sisters brother and i spending hours each day reciting the alphabet it became our temple his bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel and through us my father was able to speak blink by blink everything in our world became slow and tender as the din drama and death of the hospital and ended it with the following lines when my nape exploded i entered another dimension i was brought so low but i felt the hand of my father around me and my father brought me back when we weren 't his voice we were his i remember i 'd hold his fingers near my face bending each joint to keep it soft and limber i 'd ask him again and again to visualize the motion to watch from within as the finger curled and to then one day from the corner of my eye i saw his body slither like a snake an involuntary spasm passing through the course of his limbs at first i thought it was my own hallucination having spent so much time tending to this one body so desperate to see anything react on its own sparks of electricity flickering on and off just beneath the surface of the skin the following week he began ever so slightly to show muscle resistance connections were being made body was slowly and gently reawakening limb by limb muscle by muscle twitch by twitch i photographed him taking his first unaided breath the celebratory moment after he showed muscle resistance for the very first time but my photographs only told the outside story i wasn 't able to portray his story from within and so i began to search for a new visual language one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience i want to share with you a video from a series that i 've been working on that tries to express i started recording his thoughts and so the voice that you hear in this video is his voice for most of us our muscles begin to twitch and move long before we are conscious but my father tells me his privilege is living on the far periphery of the human experience he wonders and watches as he takes his first breaths and dreams about crawling back home so begins life at a toddler has no attitude in its being few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has i know i frequently confront walls that feel completely he invites me into his space of co healing to give the very best of myself and for him to give the very best of himself to me paralysis was an opening for him it was an opportunity to emerge to rekindle life force to sit still long enough with himself so as to fall in love with the full continuum of creation today my father is no longer locked in breathes with his own lungs speaks slowly with his own quiet voice but the work will never be finished as he says i 'm living in a broken world and there is holy work to do"
