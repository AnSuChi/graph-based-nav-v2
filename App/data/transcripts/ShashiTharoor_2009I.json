  "transcript": "as a politician and a government minister i 've become rather concerned about the in fact the american the elephant the tiger and the cell phone added a gratuitous subtitle saying india the next 21st century power and i just don 't think that 's what india 's all about or should be all about what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic it 's redolent of james bond movies and kipling ballads after we will overtake china by two thousand and we know we have that the americans have even recognized it in an agreement we grew at six point seven none of that adds up to me to what i think and so i wondered could what the future beckons for india to be all about what in other words people like to call soft power soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic joseph nye a friend of mine it 's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture its political values its foreign policies lots of countries do this he was writing initially about the states we know the alliance francaise is all about french soft power the british council the beijing olympics were an exercise in chinese soft power americans have the voice of america and the fulbright scholarships but the fact is in fact so soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments but partly despite governments and in the information era we all live in today what we might call the ted age i 'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that 's been fed on an incessant diet of internet news of televised images of cellphone videos of email gossip in other words all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries whether or not the countries concerned in this age again countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage and of course they have more influence sometimes about how they 're seen india has more all news tv channels than any country in the world in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together but the fact still is that it 's not just that you have to be connected one might argue that india has become and that makes us larger than the u s as a those fifteen million cellphones are the most connections that any country including the u s and china has ever established in the history of telecommunications but what perhaps some of you don 't realize is how far we 've come to get there you know in fact they were so rare that elected members of parliament had the right to allocate fifteen telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed if you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist or a doctor or something you might have a telephone and we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer but half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces there would be no dial tone the odds were two in three you wouldn 't get the number you were intending to reach in waiting for it to come through but lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days so it was in fact so woeful was our telephone service that a member of parliament stood up and complained about this and the then communications minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury not a right that the government had no obligation to provide better service and if the honorable member wasn 't satisfied with his telephone could he please return it since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in india now fast forward to today and this is what you see the fifteen million cell phones a month if you visit friends in the suburbs of delhi on the side streets wielding a but he 's carrying a 21st century instrument 's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free and that 's how he gets orders from the neighborhood to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed and it was a hot day and he said hey would you like some fresh coconut water and it 's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics so i said sure and he whipped out his cellphone dialed the number and a voice said i 'm up here and right on top of the nearest coconut tree with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other was a local toddy tapper who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones when they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open if the market was on whether the product they 'd harvested could be sold what price they 'd fetch they 'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back then they 'd load the cart today they 're saving half a day 's labor with a two minute phone call so this empowerment of the underclass and that transformation is part of where india is heading today mr shekhar kapur forgive me and the first goat chewing away says you know this film is not bad and the second goat says better having said that the fact is that bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of indian ness and indian culture around the globe not just in the indian diaspora in the i 've met a young man in new york whose illiterate mother in a village in senegal but these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps and she has a great time in the song and the action she goes away with stars in her eyes about india as a result and this is happening more and more we know what a serious security problem afghanistan is for so many of us in the world india doesn 't have a military mission there you know what was india 's biggest asset in afghanistan in the last seven years why because that was the moment when the indian television soap opera kyunki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi dubbed into dari was telecast on tolo t v and it was the most popular television show in afghan history crime went up at eight i have read a reuters dispatch so this is not indian propaganda a british news agency about how robbers in the town of musarri sharif * stripped a vehicle because the watchmen were busy watching the t v rather than minding the store and they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show 's heroine its own entertainment industry the same is true of course we don 't have time for too many more examples but it 's true of our of our music of our dance of our art yoga ayurveda even indian cuisine i mean the proliferation proliferation of indian restaurants since i first went abroad as a student in the mid ' 70s and what i see today you can 't go to europe or north america and not find an indian restaurant it may not be a very good one but today in britain for example so the empire can strike back tales like afghanistan comes it 's the country that tells a better story that prevails and india is and must remain in my view the land of the better having gone to the u s as a student in the mid ' 70s i knew what the image of india was then if there was an image at all today people in silicon valley and elsewhere speak of the iits the indian institutes of technology with the same reverence they used to accord to mit who was accosted at schiphol airport in amsterdam by an anxiously perspiring european saying you 're indian 're indian can you help me fix my laptop we 've gone from the image of india as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails and snake charmers with the indian rope trick but that too is transforming the indian story around the world but it 's a civilizational story to begin with because india has been an open society for millennia india gave refuge to the jews fleeing landed on the shores of kerala my home state somewhere around fifty two a d he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing jewish girl and to this day remains the only jewish diaspora in the history of the jewish people which has never encountered a single incident of slightly more differently complicated history in the north but all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in india you the fact is the last elections five years ago gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader who then made way for a sikh mohan singh to be sworn in as prime minister by a muslim president abdul kalam in a country eighty one percent hindu and of course it 's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn 't white male or christian so maybe oh sorry he is christian i beg your pardon and he is male but he isn 't white all the others have been all those three all his predecessors have been all those three and that 's the point i was trying to make but the issue is that when i talked about that example it 's not just about talking about india it 's not propaganda because ultimately and ultimately it seems to me governments aren 't very good at telling stories but people see a society for what it is and that it seems to me is what ultimately will make a difference in today 's so india now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion because we have every ethnicity known to mankind practically we 've every religion know to mankind with the possible exception of shintoism though that has some hindu elements somewhere we have twenty three official languages that are recognized in our constitution and those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note spelling out the denominations we 've got all of that we don 't even have geography uniting us because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with pakistan in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven in fact you can 't even take the name of the country for granted the whole point is that india is the nationalism of an idea it 's the idea of an ever ever land but sustained above all by pluralist democracy that is a and it 's the nationalism of an idea that consonant for that matter and still rally around a consensus and the consensus is of a very simple principle that in a diverse plural democracy like india you don 't really have to agree on everything all the time so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree the great success story of india a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate in the ' 50s and ' 60s is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus emerging into the 21st century and i do want to make the point but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome we can 't really be both of those we have to overcome our poverty the human capital the need for the ordinary person in india to be able to have a couple of square meals a day to be able to send his or her children to a decent school and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves"
