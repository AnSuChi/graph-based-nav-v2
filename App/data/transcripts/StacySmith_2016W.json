  "transcript": "it 's not immigration and it 's not malaria i 'm here to talk about movies now in all seriousness movies are actually really important and we can also be transported through storytelling stories tell us what societies value they offer us lessons and they share and preserve our history particularly not stories compartmentalized in the form of american movies and i learned this for the first time about ten years ago when i did my first study on gender role in films since then we 've conducted more than thirty investigations my team is tired and i 've committed my life as researcher and activist to fighting the inclusion crisis in hollywood so today what i 'd like to do is tell you about that crisis i want to talk about gender inequality in film i want to tell you how it is perpetuated and then i 'm going to tell you how we 're going to fix it however one caveat before i begin my data are really depressing but i 'm going to bring it up at the end and i 'm going to present a silver lining to fix this mess that we 've been in for a very very long time so let 's start with the gravity of the situation each year my research team examines the top one hundred grossing films in the united states what we do is we look at every speaking or named character on screen all a character has to do is say one word this is a very low bar let 's take a look at really some problematic trends first females are still noticeably absent less than a third there over half of a century but we 're half of the population across the top one hundred films of just last year forty eight films didn 't feature one black or african american speaking character not one seventy films were devoid of asian or asian american speaking characters that were girls or women none eighty four films didn 't feature one female character that had a disability and bisexual or transgender female speaking characters this is not underrepresentation and i call this the when we move from prevalence to protagonist the story is still problematic out of a hundred films last year only thirty two featured a female lead or colead driving the action and only one diverse woman that was forty five years of age or older at the time of theatrical release now let 's look at portrayal matter of fact they 're about three times as we like to say that these gals have no room for a womb or any other internal organ all joking aside theories suggest research confirms exposure to thin ideals and objectifying content can lead to body dissatisfaction internalization of the thin ideal and and it turns out that there are two drivers to inequality on screen let 's unpack them really quick you want to change any of the patterns i just talked about all you have to do is hire female directors turns out the female directors are associated with in terms of short films and indie indie films more girls and women on screen more stories with women in the center more stories with women forty years of age or i think is good news for this crowd more underrepresented sorry more women working behind the camera in key production roles easy answer to the problems that we just talked about or and only one woman was asian so why is it so difficult well to answer this question we conducted a study we interviewed turns out both male and female executives when they think director they think male they perceive the traits of leadership to be masculine in nature lead a ship be a visionary or be general patton all the things that we 've heard their thoughts and ideations pull male the perception of director or a leader is inconsistent with the perception of a woman the roles are i don 't need to tell this crowd further there 's some misperceptions about whether females can open a film it doesn 't have the return on investment that if you place a male at the center of a story does the force awakens our own economic analyses show that gender of the lead character doesn 't play a role in economic success in the united states but what does production costs alone or in conjunction with how widely a film is distributed in this country it so at this point we should all be sufficiently depressed no change in fifty years few female directors working behind the camera and the entertainment industry does not trust us as an audience you there would be a silver lining and there is there are actually simple and tangible solutions to fixing this problem that involve content creators executives and consumers like the individuals in this room let 's talk about a few of them the first is what i call just add five did you know if we looked at the top one hundred films next year and simply added five female speaking characters on screen to each of those films it would create a new norm we would be at gender parity for the first time in over a half of a century it doesn 't take away jobs for male second solution is for a list talent what if those what does that mean well you probably don 't know but the typical feature film has about forty to forty five speaking characters in it i would argue that only eight to ten of those characters are actually relevant to the the remaining thirty or so roles there 's no reason why those minor roles can 't match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking taking place an equity rider by an a lister in their contract can stipulate that those roles reflect the world in which we there 's no reason why a network a studio or a production company cannot adopt the same contractual language in their negotiation processes third solution this would be for the entertainment industry hollywood in particular to adopt the rooney rule when it comes to hiring practices around directors now in the the rooney rule stipulates that if a team wants to hire a coach from outside the organization what they have to do is interview an underrepresented candidate the exact same principle can apply to hollywood films how executives and agents can can make sure that women and people of color are not only on the consideration but they 're actually interviewed for the job now one might say the fourth solution is for consumers like me and you we have to support them it may mean going to the independent theater chain instead of the multiplex or it might mean scrolling down a little further online to find a film by a female director call and email companies that are making and distributing films and we need to post on our social media accounts when we want to see inclusive representation women on screen and most importantly women behind the camera we need to make our voices heard we actually have the ability to change the world on this one the us and its content films in particular have captured the worldwide imagine what would happen if the film industry aligned its values with what it shows it could foster inclusion and acceptance for girls and women the only thing that the film industry has to do is unleash at the beginning of this talk i said that films none of us because the numbers haven 't changed what would happen if the next generation of audiences grew up with a whole different screen reality what would happen well i 'm here to tell you today that it 's not only possible to change what we see on screen but i am impatient for it to get here and let 's agree to take action today to agree that us audiences and global viewers demand and deserve more and let 's agree today that the next generation of viewers and audiences that thank you"
