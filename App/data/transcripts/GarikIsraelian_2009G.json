  "transcript": "i 'm a spectroscopist i have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies etc i never deal with images spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world spectroscopy can probably answer the question is there anybody out there it 's not very fun to do spectroscopy one of my colleagues in bulgaria nevena markova spent about twenty thinking observing the same star for twenty years is incredible but we are crazy we do these things and because i 've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars and i thought because apparently you can 't have this fragile isotope of lithium 6 but you have it in planets and asteroids so if you so i invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star and actually it 's amazing because i got phone calls from many reporters asking have you actually seen the planet going into a star because they thought that if you are having a telescope you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope and you might have seen the planet going into a star and i was saying no excuse me what i see is this one it 's just incredible because nobody understood really i bet that there were very few people who really understood what i 'm talking about because this is the indication that the planet went into the star because they actually said that you can get any color you like and all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph this is the number one high resolution most precise spectrograph on this planet called harps which is actually i 'm sure most of you know from school physics that it 's basically splitting a white light and if you have a liquid hot it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum a hot gas is producing emission lines only you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies now what we can do with the spectra and we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars galaxies nebulae we have thermonuclear reactions going on creating chemical elements it 's cool for me cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees my colleagues in infra red astronomy call minus two hundred kelvin is cool for them but you know everything is relative so for me five thousand degrees is pretty cool and about fifteen percent of these lines is not yet and we still cannot properly sometimes we have to deal with for instance you see the spectral line of the gold and we use this weak feature to measure the and now this is a work in progress we have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature which belongs to osmium it 's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae it 's the only place where you can produce actually osmium just comparing we want to understand why there is so much of this element perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars it can be an indication gibor basri emailed me a very interesting spectrum asking next two weeks when i saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars i knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy which polluted the atmosphere of this star and later a black hole was formed which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions my colleagues comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy it 's amazing that you can go so far they actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien it comes from a different galaxy there is interaction of galaxies we know this and sometimes they just capture stars we were very surprised to discover a super flare a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the sun and later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything and we found that everything is normal and there are six or seven similar cases we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe it 's very complicated i don 't really want you to try to understand what is here it 's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the we end up with this picture which is a very important showing relative abundances of chemical elements in so which means that it 's really impossible to find an object where you find about ten times more sulfur than silicon and if you find one i will say that this is something related to seti because naturally you can 't do doppler effect is something very important from fundamental physics and this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source the doppler effect is used to discover extrasolar planets the precision which we need to discover a jupiter like planet and we need nine centimeters per second to detect e elt telescope and this is going to be an instrument to detect earth like planets is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves this is the sound of an alpha cen those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain the sound actually nobody knows domain coming back to the most connection between life and radioactive nuclei and we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of and potassium so those planets are tectonically dead there cannot be life if there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium now we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with it 's exactly the same game a very tiny feature and you have to first you have to convince yourself then you have to convince your colleagues and then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in one hundred parsec away from here it 's really difficult but if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets you have to do this job because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems the one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals if you receive something interesting i think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers and that is a very clear signal the slope which is coming which we call a red edge is a now very recently very recently i 'm talking about last six seven eight months methane it 's amazing so this is the power of spectroscopy you can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets we have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life now imagine an object amazing object or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say look we give up physics doesn 't work somehow and it 's something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake many years ago and shklovsky if you see strange chemical elements it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it they want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines in the spectrum of a star can be different ways doing this one is for instance technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of four point two million years you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere because in a natural way it is impossible to do this now we are reviewing the spectra of about three hundred stars with extrasolar planets and we are doing this job since two thousand and we have some interesting cases candidates so on things which we can 't really explain and i hope in the near is the spectrum of"
