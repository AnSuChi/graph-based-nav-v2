  "transcript": "i make technologies to help them communicate they have a common source and that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction let me tell you you see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup all of us can see it all of us understand this these are two other pictures of soup but you can see that these are more abstract these are not quite as concrete and when you get to language see that it becomes a word whose look the way it looks and the way it sounds has absolutely nothing to do with what it started with or what it represents which is the bowl of soup and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount now that 's why most of the people that work with children with autism speech therapists educators what they do is they try to help children with autism communicate not with words but with pictures so if a child with autism wanted to say i want soup and this has been incredibly effective for the last thirty forty years people have been doing this in fact a few years back i developed an app for the ipad which does exactly this it 's called avaz and the way it works is that kids select different pictures these pictures are sequenced together to form sentences it 's a translator it converts pictures into speech now this was very effective there are thousands of children using this and i started thinking about what it does and what it doesn 't do and i realized something interesting avaz helps children with autism learn words what it doesn 't help them do is to learn take this sentence and that 's why a sentence like i want soup tonight is different from a sentence like soup want i tonight which is completely meaningless now this is what we call grammar and grammar is incredibly powerful because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information it 's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to and so after i happened to chance upon a child with autism conversing with and this is what happened completely out of what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions so somebody else wants to eat you want to eat cream now you want to eat ice cream in the evening you arrange them in this map where they 're all linked together not by placing them one one after the other but in questions in question answer and so if you do this then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in english but what you 're conveying is really now meaning is really the underbelly in some sense of language it 's what comes after thought but before language and the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form so i was very excited by this you know hopping around all over the place trying to figure out if i can convert all possible sentences that i hear you want to say i don 't want soup then you can 't do that by asking a question you do that by changing the word want again if you wanted to say i wanted soup yesterday you do that by converting the word want into this is a map of words joined together as questions and answers let 's take this sentence i told the carpenter i could not pay him it 's a fairly complicated sentence the way that this particular system works you can start with any part of this sentence i 'm going to start with the word this happened in the past so i 'm going to make that told now we start with a different part of the sentence we start with the word pay and we add the ability filter to it to make it can pay then we make it i couldn 't pay the carpenter and then you join these two together by asking this question what did i tell the carpenter this is this is a representation and there are two or three interesting things about this first of all i could have started anywhere i didn 't have to start with the word tell i could have started anywhere in the sentence and i could have made this entire thing so long as the questions are standardized the map is actually independent of language so i call this freespeech and i was playing with this for many many months i was trying out so many different combinations of this and then i noticed something very interesting about freespeech it allowed me to actually create very concise rules and so i developed this thing i developed this thing called the freespeech engine which takes any the input and gives out perfectly grammatical english text and by putting these two pieces together the representation and the engine was able to create an app a technology for children with autism that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar so i tried this out with kids with with autism and i found that there was an incredible amount of identification they were able to create sentences in freespeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in and i had an idea and i want to talk to you about this idea next in about one thousand there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language and they found something very interesting they found that when you learn a language as a as a and when you learn a language as an adult for example if i wanted to learn japanese right now now i don 't know why that 's the case but my guess is that that 's because when you learn a language as an adult you almost invariably learn it through so what 's interesting about freespeech is that when you create a a child with autism creates language with freespeech and so this this gave me this idea is it possible to use freespeech not for children with autism but to teach language the first thing i did was i built they 're able to learn language this has a lot of potential a lot of promise and the government of india recently licensed this technology from us and they 're going to try it out with millions of different children the vision really is that when they learn english this way they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue now what 's interesting about speech is that speech is one dimensional because it 's sound it 's also one dimensional because our mouths are built that way our mouths are built to create one dimensional sound if you think about the brain the thoughts that we have in our heads now it seems to me that language is really the brain 's invention to convert this rich multi dimensional thought on one hand now what 's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays and almost all of that is done in the language domain what if we could do this in freespeech instead i have a suspicion that if we did this we 'd find that algorithms like searching like retrieval all of these things are much simpler instead they 're processing the data structure of thought so this is the we have the free speech representation on one side so everything that this system knows about english is actually encoded into the engine you 've encoded an entire human language into a software program but it 's not very complicated code and what 's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really it might be very easy for us to actually create these engines and that gives another interesting idea for example supposing i was a writer say for a newspaper or for a magazine i could create content in one language freespeech and the person who 's consuming that content the person who 's who 's reading that that particular information and they could read it in in their native language i mean we have so many different languages there 's a song about india and there 's a description of of the country as i want to leave you with this this is a photograph of of my collaborators my earliest collaborators when i started working on language and autism and various other things but her story is much more remarkable than mine because pavna is about twenty three she has quadriplegic cerebral palsy so ever since she was born she could neither move collaborating with me to develop avaz all of these things she 's done with nothing more than moving her eyes daniel webster said this he said i would choose to keep the power of communication that 's closest to my heart still remains the ability for this to empower children with disabilities to be able to communicate the power of communication to get back all the rest"
