  "transcript": "they have what i called which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane laughter but what they do have is incredible social skills when you meet them they lock into you they look you in the eye they invade your personal space they massage the back of your head i had dinner with a republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal squeezing it and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other and i was like get a room i don 't want to see this last election cycle i was following mitt romney around new hampshire and he was campaigning with his five he 's going into a diner and he goes into the diner introduces himself to a family and says what village are you from in new hampshire and then he describes the home he owned in their village and so he goes around he first names almost everybody he 's just met i was like okay but the paradox is when a lot of these people slip into the policy making mode that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants so in the course of my career i have covered a series of failures we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn 't do anything stupid for thirty years i 've been covering school reform and we 've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes charters private schools vouchers and the fact is people learn from why are the most and i came to the conclusion this is a symptom of a larger problem that for centuries we 've inherited a view of nature based on the notion that we 're divided selves and it 's led to a view of human nature that we 're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives and it 's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure and it 's produced a great amputation a shallow view of human nature we 're really good at talking about material things but we 're really bad at talking about emotions we 're really good at talking about skills and safety and but we no longer have a system by which to connect them and so this has led to a shallow path in politics but also in a whole range of human endeavors you can see it in the way we raise our young kids you go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out and they 're wearing these 80 pound backpacks if the wind blows them over they 're like beetles stuck there on the ground you see these cars that drive up they get picked up by these creatures i 've called uber moms who are highly successful career women have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into harvard and you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children so at the driving them home they want them to be enlightened so they take them to ben & jerry 's ice cream company with its own foreign policy in one of my books i joke that ben & jerry 's should make a pacifist toothpaste doesn 't kill germs just asks them to leave it would be a big seller and they go to whole foods to get their baby formula and whole foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they 're on loan from amnesty international snacks there called veggie booty with kale which is for kids who come home and say mom mom i want a snack that 'll help prevent soccer practice they and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a and they make a ton of money and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like jackson hole or aspen and they 've become elegant and slender they don 't really have thighs they just have one elegant calve on top of another they have kids of their own and they 've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people so their grandmoms look like gertrude stein their daughters looks like halle berry i don 't they get there and they realize 160 pound dogs all look like velociraptors i 'm just not going to die they 're popping cialis like breath mints you see them on the mountains up there they 're cross country skiing up up the mountain with these grim expressions that make dick cheney look like jerry lewis and as they whiz by you it 's like being passed by a little iron raisinet going up the hill and so this is part of what life is but it 's not all of what life is and over the past few and it 's not based on theology or philosophy it 's in the study we 're developing a revolution in consciousness the first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species the unconscious mind does most of the work and so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute of which it can and this leads to oddities one of my favorite is that people named dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists which is why i named my daughter president of the united states brooks another finding is that the unconscious far from being and the way you should do that is the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to now i 'm a middle aged guy i 'm not exactly comfortable with emotions one of my favorite brain stories described these middle aged guys they put them into a and then they had and the the brain scans were identical in both activities sheer terror and the third insight is that we 're not primarily self contained individuals we 're social though probably not as good and we see this and this revolution in who we are gives us a different way of seeing i think politics a different way most importantly of seeing human capital we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties that dehumanizing bias it gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily things like grades sat 's degrees the number of years in schooling what it really takes to do well to lead a meaningful life are things that are deeper and so let me list just a couple of the things i think this research points us the first gift or talent is mindsight the ability to babies come with this ability meltzoff who 's at the university of washington leaned over a baby who was forty three minutes old he wagged his tongue at the baby the baby wagged her tongue back babies are born to interpenetrate into mom 's mind and to download what they find their models of how to understand reality in the united states percent of babies have a deep two way conversation with mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people and those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life scientists at the university of minnesota did a study in which they could predict with seventy seven percent accuracy twenty percent of kids do not have those one from another a second skill is equipoise the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind so for example we are overconfidence machines ninety five percent of our professors report that they are above average teachers time magazine asked americans are you in the top one percent of earners nineteen percent of americans are in the top one percent but some people have the ability and awareness of of their own biases their own overconfidence they have epistemological modesty they are curious and these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with iq the third trait is metis the ability to pick out patterns in an environment derive a gist they couldn 't tell you how they and they were more often right than wrong the third is what you might call sympathy the ability to work within groups because ninety percent of our communication is non verbal and the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the iq of the group it 's determined any child can say i 'm a tiger pretend to be a tiger it seems so elementary but in fact it 's phenomenally complicated to take a concept i and a concept tiger and blend them together but the moral systems entailed in them and this is not an ability it 's a drive and a motivation the unconscious mind hungers for those moments of when a naturalist when a believer feels at one with god 's love 've come across in this research of how minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named douglas hofstadter at the university of indiana he was married to a woman named carol and hofstadter wrote a book called i am a strange loop in the course of that book he describes a moment just months after carol has died he comes across her picture on the mantel or on a bureau in his bedroom and here 's what he wrote and i looked so deeply that i felt i was behind her eyes and all at once i found myself saying as tears flowed ' that 's me that 's me ' and those simple words brought back many thoughts that i had had before about the fusion of our souls into one higher level entity about the fact that at the core of both our souls about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both that welded us into a unit the kind of unit i had but dimly imagined before being married and having children i realized that though carol had died that core piece of her had not died at all but had had lived on very determinedly in my brain we have come to acknowledge i think how shallow our view of human nature has been and now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are comes this revolution in consciousness these people in so many fields exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted this it had a vast effect on the climate of the times and it 's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture"
