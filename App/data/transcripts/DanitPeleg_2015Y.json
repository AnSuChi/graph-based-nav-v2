  "transcript": "i was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day and i had access to 3d printers so i quickly designed a skirt on my computer and i loaded the file on the printer it just printed the pieces overnight and this is actually the skirt that i 'm wearing right now and i had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks i loved experimenting with new materials and i always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique and then bring them home to experiment on as you can probably imagine my roommates didn 't like that at all so i decided to move on to working with big machines ones that didn 't fit in my living room i love the exact and the custom work i can do with all kinds of fashion technologies like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing one summer break i came here to new york for an internship at a fashion house in chinatown we worked on two incredible dresses that were they were amazing like you can see here few issues with them they were made from hard plastics and that 's why they were very breakable the models couldn 't sit in them and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms with 3d printing the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted but still they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio and then i thought if i can print a necklace from home why not print my clothes from home too i really liked the idea that i wouldn 't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell i could just design i found a small every night the main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with so what is a filament filament is the material you feed the printer with and i spent a month or so experimenting with pla which is a hard and scratchy breakable material yet very flexible and with it i was able to print the first i chose this word because i felt so empowered and free when i could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself and actually you can easily download this jacket and easily change the word to something else for example your name or your sweetheart 's name laughter so the printer plates are small so i had to piece the garment together just like and i wanted to solve another challenge i wanted to print textiles that i would use just like regular fabrics that 's when i found an open source file from an architect who designed a pattern and with it i was able to print a beautiful textile that i would use just like a regular fabric so i brought six printers to my home and just printed and this is actually a really slow process but let 's remember the internet was significantly slower twenty years ago so 3d printing will also accelerate and in no time you 'll be able to print a t shirt in your home in just a couple of hours or even minutes so you guys you want to see what it looks like audience yeah danit peleg almost everything here she 's wearing i printed from my home even her shoes are printed think in the future materials will evolve and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today like cotton or silk imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements but now you can just download the music digital music directly to your phone and i wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital just like this skirt is thank you so much"
