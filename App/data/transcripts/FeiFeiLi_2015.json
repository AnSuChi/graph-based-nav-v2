  "transcript": "let me show you something describing what she sees in a series of photos but she 's already an expert at one very important task to make sense of what she sees our society is more technologically advanced than ever we send people we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like so i 'm here today to give you a progress report on the latest advances in our research in computer vision one of the most frontier and but without smart vision we have made fabulous megapixel cameras drones can fly over massive land but don 't have enough vision technology to help us to track the changes of the rainforests but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool photos and videos yet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding and managing this enormous because our smartest machines are still blind why is this so hard you may ask but these are just lifeless numbers they do not carry meaning in themselves and by seeing we really mean understanding in fact it took mother nature five hundred and forty million years of hard work to do so for fifteen years now starting from my ph d at caltech and then leading stanford 's vision lab i 've been working with my mentors students to teach computers to see emotions actions and intentions places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them the building block of the visual world in its simplest terms and designing a model that learns from these training images how hard can this be after all a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors and this is what we did in the early days of object modeling we 'd tell the computer algorithm but what about this cat it what about these silly cats now you get my point even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model and a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking no one tells a child the average time an eye movement is made so by age three a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world so instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences we know this we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images than we have ever had before perhaps thousands of times more imagenet project in two thousand and seven we went to the internet we downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology like the amazon mechanical turk platform to help us to label these images at its peak was one of the biggest employers of the amazon mechanical turk workers sort and label nearly a billion candidate images takes in in the early developmental years it was not so obvious we were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure we were constantly struggling for research funding once so we carried on in two thousand and nine the imagenet project delivered a database of fifteen million images across twenty two thousand classes of objects and things this was an unprecedented scale than sixty two thousand cats of all kinds of looks and poses we were thrilled to have put together wanted the whole research world to benefit from it so in the ted fashion we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free imagenet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called a basic operating unit in a neural network is a neuron like node it takes input from other nodes these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers also similar to the brain it has twenty four million nodes one hundred and forty million parameters and fifteen it became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition this is a computer us this picture contains a cat or a picture of very busy things like a man a skateboard year of the cars and we have learned something really interesting first it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household so wait a minute is that it has the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities we have just taught the computer to see objects this is like a small so instead of saying this is a cat in the picture you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed now the computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by like the brain integrates vision and language we developed a model that connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models that is capable of generating a now i 'm ready to show you what the computer says when it sees the picture that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk of course we 're still working hard to improve our algorithms and it still has a lot to learn and the computer still makes mistakes it thinks everything might look like a cat so it has been a long journey to get from age zero to three was hard the real challenge is to go from three to thirteen and far beyond let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the but there 's so much more to this picture than just a person and a cake what the computer doesn 't see is that this is a special italian cake that 's only served during easter given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to sydney and you and i can all tell how happy he is and what 's exactly on his mind at that moment this is my son leo on my quest for visual intelligence i think of leo constantly and the future world he will live in when machines can see doctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose and take care of patients we will discover new species better materials and explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines then they help us to see better for the first time human eyes won 't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world we will not only use the machines for their intelligence we will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine this is my quest to give computers visual intelligence thank you"
