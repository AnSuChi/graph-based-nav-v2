  "transcript": "i spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my probably too much i probably obsess over it my friends think i do but i feel like i kind of have to because these days it feels like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me and when that happens it feels like parts of my life are slipping away specifically it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away to various things like this like technology i check things i 'll give you an example but i 'm not just going to i 'm actually going to do is spend the next twenty minutes but the worst part is that i know this is what 's going to happen and even knowing that that 's what 's going to happen doesn 't stop me from doing it again the next time but the thing is that pull down to refresh again but i 'll give you a hint why this is happening what do you think makes more money in the united states game parks and baseball combined slot machines how can slot machines make all this money when we play with such small amounts of money we play with coins how is this possible the thing is my phone i 'm playing the slot machine to and the thing is that again knowing exactly how this works and i 'm a designer i know exactly how the psychology of this works i know exactly what 's going on i still just get sucked into it but then you 're wondering am i missing something important in other words you 're either distracted so we need to restore choice we want to have a with technology that gives us back choice about how we spend time with it and we 're going to need help so let 's take an example that we all face so let 's say there 's two people nancy 's on the left and she 's working on a document and john 's on the right suddenly remembers i need to ask nancy for that document before i forget it blows away her attention because every time we interrupt each other it takes us about we actually cycle through two different projects before we come back to the original thing we were doing this is gloria mark 's research combined with microsoft research that showed this and her research also shows that it actually trains bad what if i 'm missing something important design now when john wants to message her except this time it holds the messages which is that nancy needs to know that if something is truly important john can still interrupt but instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions so we 're doing two things here we 're creating a new choice for both nancy and john but there 's a second subtle thing we 're doing here too instead of the goal of chat let 's design it so it 's easy to send a message that 's the goal of chat it should be really easy to send a message to someone we change the goal to something deeper and a human value which is let 's create the highest possible quality communication in a relationship so we upgraded the goal now do designers actually care about this do we want to have conversations about what a little over a year ago i got to help organize a meeting between some of technology 's leading designers and thich nhat hanh thich nhat hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness and it was the most amazing meeting you have to imagine picture a room on one side of the room you have a bunch of tech geeks on the other side of the room you have a bunch of and the questions were about the deepest human values like what does the future of technology look like when you 're designing for the deepest questions and the deepest human and our conversation centered on listening more deeply to what those values might be meaning you might highlight a word that might be accidentally so well the answer is yes one of my favorites is couchsurfing if you didn 't know couchsurfing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay with a free couch from someone who 's trying to offer it well you would think it 's to match guests with hosts so what 's the deeper human goal well they set their goal as the need to create lasting positive experiences and relationships between people who 've never met before and the most amazing thing about this was in two thousand and seven they introduced a way which is incredible i 'll tell you how it works for every design goal you have have you have to have a corresponding measurement to know how you 're doing so what they do is let 's say you take two people and they they take the number of days those two people spent and then they estimate how many hours were in those days and they subtract from those positive hours why should we value that as success and what you were left with is something they refer to as net orchestrated conviviality or really just a net good times created the net hours that would have never existed had couchsurfing not existed can you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day and measure actual net new contribution of hours in people 's lives that are positive that would have never existed if you didn 't do what you were about to do at work today can you imagine can you imagine a social network and subtracted from that the articles you weren 't glad you read or the time you spent scrolling that you didn 't like instead measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got that they were excited to get and subtracted the amount of time people spent on the website or imagine dating services which is how they measure success today instead measured the deep now to do this you also need a new system because you 're probably thinking today 's internet economy today 's economy in general is measured in time spent the more users you have the more usage you have the more time people spend that 's how we measure but we 've solved this problem before where we said this is a different kind of building what if what if we had something so it would actually can you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world which is your metric for net and have an honest conversation about that maybe you 're not doing so well to start with but let 's start that conversation designers you can redefine success you can redefine design arguably you have more power than many people in your in your organization to create the choices that all of us live by maybe like in medicine where we have a hippocratic oath to recognize the responsibility and and this higher value that we have to treat patients what if designers had something like that in terms of this new kind of design now it may seem walmart didn 't have organic food until the consumer demand was there we have to demand and we can do that and doing that would amount to shifting from a world that 's driven and run entirely on time i want to live in this world and i want this conversation to happen let 's start that conversation now"
