  "transcript": "and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things to see hear but in the last year and a half i 've started to switch over and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this it 's really our first foray into this it 's the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness so let me start in on that problem there are ten million people in the u s and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness diseases like macular degeneration and there 's little that can be done for them there are some drug treatments but they 're only effective on a small fraction of the population the problem is that and so you know for example with these devices so nothing nothing close to normal vision has been possible okay so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve here you have a retina so you have an image a retina and a brain the photoreceptors then what happens is the retinal circuitry the middle part goes to work on it and what it does is it it performs operations on it it extracts information from and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted like this pattern of pulses here actually means baby 's face and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was say a dog or another pattern would be a house anyway you get the idea so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you 're looking at is is changing all the time too so you know it 's sort of a complicated thing you have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you 're but because of all that degeneration they aren 't sending any signals anymore they aren 't getting any input so the person 's brain no longer gets any visual information that is he or she is blind so this is what we 've been working on and this is what our prosthetic does so it consists of two parts what we call an encoder and a transducer and then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain and the result is so a completely blind retina even one with no front end circuitry at all no photoreceptors can now okay so i just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it 's doing because it 's really the key part and it 's sort of interesting and kind of cool i 'm not sure cool is really the right word but you know what i mean what it 's doing is it 's replacing the retinal circuitry really the guts of the retinal circuitry with so it 's just math in other words we 're not literally replacing the components of the retina it 's not like we 're making a little mini device for each of the different cell types we 've just abstracted what the what the retina 's doing and so in a way the equations are serving as sort of a codebook an image comes and out comes streams of electrical pulses just like a normal retina would produce and what the what the implications of this are the middle one is from a blind animal that 's been treated with device and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic so the bottom one is the state of the art device that 's out there so what we did was we presented movies of everyday things people babies park benches you know regular things happening and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals now just to orient you and i just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so i could show you a long stretch of data so as you can see the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the really do very closely match the normal firing patterns and it 's not perfect but it 's pretty and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic the responses really don 't how important is is this what 's the potential impact on a patient 's ability to see so i 'm just going to show you one so what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked what was the retina seeing at that moment can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns when we did this for responses from so let me show you and i 'm going to start with the standard method first they 're very limited in what they can tell you about what 's out there so you can see that there 's something there but it 's not so clear what that something is and this just sort of circles back to what i was saying in the beginning that with the standard method patients can see but it it doesn 't easily go further than that it was a baby 's face so what about with our approach and you can see that it 's much better not only can you tell that it 's a baby 's face but you can tell that it 's this baby 's face which is a really challenging task and on the right is from an actual blind retina this is just actually the first one that we tried i just wanted to say something about the standard method but there was and so this this was our contribution now i just want to wrap up and as i was mentioning earlier of course i have a lot of other data if you 're interested but i just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in in its language and the potential power of being able to do that so it 's different from the motor prosthetics where you 're communicating from the brain to and then the last thing i wanted to say really is so the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find for example the auditory system and the motor system so for treating deafness and for and for motor disorders so just the same way that we were able to jump over the the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina 's output cells we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve or jump over damaged areas in the cortex in the motor cortex to bridge the gap i just want to end with a simple message that the language of the brain things become possible that that didn 't seem obviously possible before thank you"
