  "transcript": "professionally i try to make sense so my father might not understand what it is that i do for a i now have this and that of course made it pretty easy for me in good family tradition if you like but of course most journeys that we undertake from day to day are within a city getting from a to b may seem pretty obvious and and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place once you find your base your home you start to build this cognitive map of your environment it 's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain us humans of course we don 't we don 't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks like bats just don 't do that although a night in the temple bar district can get pretty wild laughter no but our mind keeps and we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90 degree angle this of course makes for some funny moments when you 're in some old city layout that follows some sort of circular and you want to get to another point on a side street just like that the cognitive map in your mind may tell you take a 90 degree turn and walk down that other side street and you suddenly discover but i always feel like i find this wormhole or this inter dimensional portal so we move along linear routes and our mind straightens streets and perceives if you go to the irish countryside she 'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work and go past that church where i got married that kind of thing so we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them we recognize them by the experiences we 're all capable of understanding and and you just observe yourself create this awesome piece of communication design it 's got straight lines it 's got and you 'd realize your streets and the distances they 'd be way off no what you 've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic it 's a visual construct letters designed in the language of our brains so it 's no big surprise that the big icon of the last century the pinnacle of showing everybody how to get from a to b the london underground map was not designed by a cartographer or a city planner it was designed by an engineering draftsman in the harry beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever now the very key to the success of this map is in the omission of less important information you 'd see they 're very different but this is all for the clarity of the public tube map change over take another tube of course what you don 't know is now we 've reached the subject of public public transport here in dublin is a somewhat touchy subject they all run side by side and converge in pretty much because but when you explore a foreign and new public you choose yourself a rapid transport route and only then you start to discover some local bus routes and i found those brochures say in the city center there were never actually any lines that showed the routes there are actually not even any stations with names and after i finished the project and being half german i researched how each and every bus route moved through the city i plotted it into my own map of dublin i got a nice spaghetti plate so i decided of course you 're going to apply the rules of schematic design cleaning up the corridors widening the streets where there were loads of buses and making the streets at straight 90 degree corners 45 degree corners or fractions of that and filled it in with the bus routes and i built this city center bus map of the system how it was five years ago i 'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the quays and westmoreland street now i can proudly say i can proudly say this diagram is an utter failure except probably in i now had a great visual representation of just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was now call me the greek guy inside of me it 's like entering the labyrinth so the outcome of loads of questionnaires case studies and looking at a lot of maps was that a lot of the problems and shortcomings of the public transport system here in dublin was the lack of a coherent public transport map a simplified coherent public transport map but it 's also the crucial step so i teamed up with a gentleman called james leahy a civil engineer and a recent master 's we distributed these because we wanted them to be james wanted to use bus rapid transport for that rather than light rail for me it was important that the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors would be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the we could take out all the local buses that ran alongside those rapid transport means any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again so in other words we put a bus back in one of these thick lines over there so the rest was merely a couple of months of work and a couple of fights with my girlfriend of our place constantly being clogged up with maps and the outcome one of the outcomes was this map of the greater dublin area i 'll zoom in a little bit this map only shows the rapid transport connections no local bus very was so successful in london and that since has been exported to so many other major cities and therefore is the language that we should use for public transport maps what 's also important is with a simplified network like this it now would become possible for me to tackle the ultimate challenge and make a public transport map for the city center and this is what a map like this could look like i 'll zoom in a little bit so rapid transport and most of the side streets even with their the map is relatively small in overall size so something that you could still hold as a fold out map or display in a reasonably sized display box on a bus shelter i think it tries to be the the best balance between actual representation and simplification the language of way finding in our brain so straightened lines and of course that very very important geographic distortion that makes public transport maps possible if you for example have a look at the two main corridors that run through the city the yellow and orange one over here this is how they look in and this is how they would look in my the reactions i got were tremendous i was very happy to see that my folks in germany and greece finally have an idea"
