  "transcript": "is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called and as you 'll see later it can also swim and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion but when you go jogging or play tennis we do amazing things because if the coordination is bad we fall over or we do bad locomotion and my goal is to understand how this works and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals then you have the spinal cord and in the spinal cord you find reflexes multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity a third component are central pattern generators these are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate by themselves very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity but what 's interesting is to what extent just a low level component the spinal cord together with the body already solve a big part of the locomotion especially in humans very hard to do a second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between so it 's very hard to find out what 's the role of each over time is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job the robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well there are some very nice projects where robots are used like a scientific tool for neuroscience for biomechanics or for and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots and here a robot becomes an interesting tool to validate our models like more or less twenty years ago i was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my phd like simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex very hard to simulate that properly on a computer why not have a real robot and real physics and it 's because as an amphibian it 's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view it makes a wonderful link between swimming as you find it in eels or fish and in fact the modern salamander is is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate so it 's almost a living fossil which gives us us access to our ancestor the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods so the salamander swims by doing what 's called an anguilliform swimming gait so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail it switches to what 's called a walking trot gait in this case you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body that 's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on pleurobot now if you stimulate a bit more the gait accelerates and at some point automatically the animal switches to swimming this is amazing just changing the global drive as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord makes a complete switch between two very different gaits and in fact the same has been observed in cats if you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat you can switch between walk trot and gallop you can make a bird switch between walking at a low level of and we had in fact access to a very nice x ray video machine from professor martin fischer in jena university in germany and thanks to that you really have an amazing machine to record all so we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3d and what we did is collect a whole database of motions both on ground and in water to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do and then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot so we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure where to place the motors how to connect them together to be able to replay these motions as well as possible if you we can do swimming so for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits and here we were very happy because this is difficult to do so we had to do what 's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics and we were very very happy with this so let 's go to the spinal cord so here what we did and we know where these neural oscillators are but what did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits and we tested that on board of a robot and this is how it looks so what you see here is a previous version of pleurobot that 's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot and the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain heading and type of gait when we stimulate at a low level we have the and finally we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other it just has to worry about this high level 's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles the first one is that a cat limb more or less looks is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel so a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments which is a good idea because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly the and this so this is peter eckert who does his phd on on this robot and as you see it 's a cute little robot it looks a bit like a toy but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of and also very elastic so you can easily press it down and it will not break it and this very elastic property is also very important and you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph now meaning no sensors no complex feedback loops and that 's interesting as you will see in the next video where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step which was a surprise for us you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything but what 's important here is that just for small perturbation the mechanics are right and i think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience saying don 't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion and especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans the person can become paraplegic or so a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations and there are several teams in the world that do exactly that especially at but to do this properly it 's very important to understand and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord thank you seen in your lab other robots that do things like but for this one you mentioned in your talk like a side project and it does have a camera on its nose we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection so this robot is now seeing you and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs why not send in a robot that can crawl around swim walk with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor don 't get scared by the shape of this ai yeah we should probably change the appearance quite a bit because here i guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you but by changing the appearance and it making it more robust i 'm sure we can make a good tool out"
