  "transcript": "we can cut violent deaths around the world by fifty percent in the next three decades all we have to do you don 't believe me i 've been thinking about this a lot for the last twenty years i 've been working in countries and cities i 've worked with warlords in afghanistan and the congo in papua new guinea you don 't need to be on the front line though to get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control right there 's this feeling that international instability is the new normal but i want you to take a closer look because it 's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime tripoli salvador violence is migrating to the metropole but when it comes australia and japan where violence is actually at historic lows but you africa and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality they talk about forty to fifty fragile states that will shape security in the 21st century i think it 's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder and the fight for development whether you define that as eradicating poverty i want to talk to and if we can get to grips with these i think we can do something with that lethal violence problem so let me start with some good news fact is we 're living in the most peaceful moment in ukraine 50 year long secular decline what 's more we 're seeing a dramatic reduction especially in the west most northern cities today are one hundred times safer than they were just one hundred years ago these two facts the decline in armed conflict and the decline in murder are amongst the most extraordinary and we should be really excited right well there 's just one problem you see five hundred and twenty five thousand people men women boys and girls research i 've been doing with keith krause and others has shown that between fifty thousand and sixty thousand people are dying in war zones violently ten times more people are dying outside of war than inside war what 's more violence is moving south to latin america and to bits of the middle east and forty of the fifty most dangerous cities in the world are right here in latin america thirteen in brazil and the most dangerous of all it 's san pedro sula it 's also being reconfigured to the world the dominance of the city as the primary mode of of urban living is one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history you all know the figures right there 's seven point three billion people in the world today there will be nine point six billion by two thousand and fifty but they tell us that it 's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence it 's the speed of urbanization that matters i call this and you think about karachi was about five hundred thousand people in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven a hustling bustling city today it kinshasa these cities are now forty times larger than they were in it took one hundred and fifty years to get to eight million people mexico city took fifteen to reach that same interval now what do these medium large what we 're seeing but the youth bulge is something we 've got to watch what it basically means is the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities is much larger than those living in our healthier and wealthier ones in some fragile cities it 's like palo alto on steroids now if you look at dili and kabul and tokyo and this is the kicker you know what i 'm talking about right just imagine your boy without any structure out there cavorting about now take away the parents and sit back and watch the fireworks i 'm sorry shave off two right there you lack employment you 're black and you 're male there 's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers in this country they 're where the smart people gather they 're more digitally savvy and and this explosion the internet and mobile technology means that the digital divide separating the north and the south between countries and within them is shrinking take the case of law enforcement police around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data to anticipate crime but it 's not just the cops who are innovating we 've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups who are engaging in but most worrying of all are criminal gangs they 're using it to recruit to sell their products to coerce to intimidate and to kill so this is just a partial sketch i mean there are many other megarisks that are going to define fragility in our time not least income inequality but we 're facing a stark dilemma we need to start a conversation we can 't only focus on those cities that work the singapores the kuala lumpurs the dubais the shanghais we 've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation one way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices of what works and what doesn 't a wonderful example of this is coming from el salvador and los angeles where the mayors in san salvador and we 've seen homicide rates go down in san salvador once the world 's most violent city by fifty percent we can also focus on hot cities but also hot did you know that between one and two percent of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to ninety nine percent of violent crime take the case of so paulo where i 've been working it 's gone from being brazil 's most dangerous city to one of its safest and it did this by doubling down on information collection hot spot mapping and police reform increases the risks of being killed and killing we have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children our youngest children and valorize them not stigmatize them recreation we 've also got to make our cities safer more inclusive and livable for all the fact is social cohesion and it did this by deliberately investing in its low income and most violent areas and integrating them with the middle class ones through a network of cable cars of and finally there 's technology we 've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation and much of it coming from this room the police are engaging in predictive analytics citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions even my own group is involved in developing applications to if i have one single message for you it 's this there is nothing inevitable about lethal violence and we can make we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime so i have just one question what are we waiting for thank you"
