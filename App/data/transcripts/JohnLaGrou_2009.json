  "transcript": "the smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide but smoke alarms don 't prevent fires every year in the usa over twenty thousand are killed or injured with three hundred and fifty thousand home fires and one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity what if we could prevent electrical fires before they start well a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical well thomas edison invented the circuit breaker in technology and this is a problem because over eighty percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers hmmm so we considered all of this and we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself any electrical device an appliance an extension cord whatever must be able to tell the power outlet hey power outlet i 'm drawing too much current shut me off now before i start a fire and the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it so here is what we did now every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network the appliance 's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug if too much current is flowing the intelligent receptacle turns every year in the usa roughly two thousand five hundred children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles and this is crazy until an intelligent plug is detected saving lives perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings this invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill by automatically cycling heavy loads like air there are ten billion electrical outlets in north america alone the potential energy savings is very very significant thousands of lives"
