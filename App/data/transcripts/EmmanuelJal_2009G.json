  "transcript": "and i come from a long way i 've been telling a story that has been so painful for me it 's been a tough journey for me traveling the world telling my story in form of a book and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music so i have i 'm doing this because of an old lady in my have lost her children and i 'm doing it for a young man or there is no internet like facebook myspace youtube for them to to talk also one thing that kept me the dreams i have sometimes is like the voices of the dead that i have seen would tell me don 't give up keep on going because sometime i feel like well i was born in the most difficult time when my country was at war i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five my mother was claimed by the war my brothers and sisters were scattered and up to now me and my father were detached and i still have issues with him and and not only that when i was eight i became a child soldier i didn 't know what was the war for but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head as possible but that was the driving force because i wanted to revenge for my family i wanted to revenge for my village luckily now things have changed because i came to discover the truth what was actually killing us wasn 't the muslims wasn 't the arabs it and using religion to get what they want to get out of us which is the oil the gold and the land so realizing the truth gave me a position to choose should i continue to hate or let it go so i happened to forgive now i sing i dance with them i even had funded by muslim people so which is easier for me i 'm going to give you poem called forced to sin which is from my album war child i talk about my story my every moment voices in my brain of friends that was slain friends like lual who died by my side of starvation in the burning jungle and the desert plain next was i but jesus heard my cry as i was tempted to eat the rotten flesh he gave me comfort we used to raid villages stealing chickens goats and sheeps anything we could sometimes you gotta lose to win never give up never give in left home at the age of seven one year later live with an slept with one eye open wide i saw sergeant command raising his retreat no surrender yet as i wage this new war i 'm not alone in this no sit or stop as i reach for the top i 'm fully dedicated like a patriotic first time i 'm feeling like a human being ah the children of left home don 't even know the day i 'll ever return and why why i ate snails was ready to eat i know it 's a shame but who is to be blamed that 's my story shared in the form of a lesson is the music i do i never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy so the music had been my therapy for me it 's been where i actually see heaven where i can be happy where i can be a child again in dances so one thing i know about music music is the only thing that has power and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg without even wanting to do it the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love doesn 't see a color you know if you fall in love with a frog that 's it one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when but i don 't know why i don 't hate their music so we party and dance to their music and one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an arab musician but i had this question so now i 'm doing music so i know what the power of music is today is day number two hundred and and i 've done a campaign called lose to win where i 'm losing and i 'm doing this because also i choose not to and so i made a but i 've been humbled so it 's taken me two hundred and thirty two days and i said no stop until we get it the lowest amount we ever got was twenty cents somebody donated twenty cents online i don 't know how they did it that moved me and so the importance of education to me is what i 'm willing to die for i 'm willing to die for this because i know what it can do to my people education enlighten your brain give you so many as a nation we have been crippled for so many years we have fed on aid you see a families in a refugee camps they only get the food that drops from the sky from the u n so these people you 're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid give the farmers they can grow the crops invest in education education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything because we have all those old men that are creating wars in africa they will die soon but if you invest in education then we 'll be able to change africa that 's what i 'm asking so in order to do that and now we have a couple in university we have like forty kids and i said i 'm going to put it in practice but i 'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called emma mccune that made it possible for me to be here i 'm gonna sing this song just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference she came to my country and saw the importance educating the so she even ended up marrying a commander from from the spla and so at this moment i want to ask to celebrate emma with me are you guys ready to celebrate emma to know the was somebody"
