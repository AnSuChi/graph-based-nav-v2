  "transcript": "i happen to live in a little town princeton in new jersey which which was in fact a very important battle it was the first battle that george washington won in fact was and about a quarter of all the people in princeton died that winter from hunger and cold but nobody remembers that and so i agree very emphatically that and that 's what we 're going through at this time i wanted to just because i think i know very little about that i 'm not a biologist so everything i know about it can be said in one minute what i 'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic that what really turned computers into a great success in the world as a whole is toys as soon as computers became toys when kids could come home and play with them and that has to happen with biotech there 's a huge pigeon breeders rose breeders people who and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things beautiful and that will be an enormous positive step to acceptance when people have this buy the software you design it you can take it on from there i think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural becomes part of the human condition something that everybody 's familiar with and everybody accepts so let 's leave that aside i want to talk about something quite different which is what i know and it 's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that and the important fact is that most of the real estate that 's accessible to us i 'm not talking about the stars i 'm talking about the solar system the stuff that 's within reach for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes most of the real estate is very cold it has a few planets close to the sun that 's where we it has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the earth out through to since most of it consists of rock and metal mostly rock it 's not only cold but very dry so the asteroids we don 't have much hope for there stand some interesting places a little further out the moons of jupiter and saturn particularly there 's a place called europa which is europa is one of the moons of jupiter where we see a very so we believe that on europa there is in fact a deep ocean and that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore ocean probably so we would love to explore europa to go down through the ice whether there are fish unfortunately the ice is thick we don 't know just how thick it is probably miles thick so it 's very expensive and very to go down there send down your submarine or whatever it is but it 's hard go out a bit further you 'll find that beyond the orbit of neptune way out far from the sun that 's where the real estate really begins you 'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which in what we call the kuiper belt or the oort cloud these are clouds of small objects which but they are biologically very interesting indeed because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals which are just the right ones for developing life so if life could be established out there it would have all the essentials chemistry and sunlight everything that 's needed although mars is course also a very promising and interesting place but we can look outside very cheaply and in a simple fashion and that 's what i 'm going to talk about there is a it 's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy life had originated it could also have moved out onto the surface there wouldn 't have been any air there it 's a vacuum it is out you can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice growing on the surface what would they need in order to grow on the surface they 'd need first of all but better what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight the sunlight in jupiter on the satellites of jupiter is which i imagine living on the surface of europa would have to have so they could keep themselves they could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight and have roots going down into the ocean life none of these things is likely but my my philosophy is look for what 's detectable not for what 's probable there 's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there and i mean the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole this was originally when radio astronomy began detected and the regular astronomers were scornful about this they said you can easily calculate and everything else in the universe is millions of since there was nothing there you might as well not look well when radio astronomy really took off because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things so the same thing could be true for this kind of life which i 'm talking about on cold objects that it could in fact be very abundant and it 's not been detected just because we haven 't taken the trouble to look so the last thing i want to talk about is how to detect it you take that 's a canadian expression so you can see the reflection in the eyes of the animal so if you go out at night the animals and then if you 're one of these unsporting you shoot the animals and take them home and of course that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime so in canada in new zealand it 's legal because the new zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits because so the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps and and anything that doesn 't look like a sheep you shoot so i have proposed to apply the same trick or further out anywhere where you can live on a cold surface those creatures must be provided with reflectors and then when you shine sunlight and the further out you go in this the more powerful this reflection will be so actually this method of of hunting for life gets stronger because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in this becomes more and more powerful so in fact you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the earth why aren 't we doing it simply because nobody thought of it yet but i hope that we shall look and with any we probably won 't find anything none of these speculations may have any basis in fact it 's a good chance and of course if it happens it will transform our view of life it means that the way life can live out there it 's extremely hard to move from one planet to another we 're having great difficulties at the moment and it 's very hard to get from planet if you live in a vacuum if you live on the surface of one of these objects say in the kuiper belt this an object like pluto or one of the smaller you can still have sunlight and you can still survive and then if you run into another it 's likely to to be very widespread and you will have then a great competition amongst species darwinian evolution so there 'll be a huge advantage to the species which is able to jump from one and there 'll be advantages for spreading out sort of kelp like forest and they will be able to so they will in fact be quite easy us to detect"
