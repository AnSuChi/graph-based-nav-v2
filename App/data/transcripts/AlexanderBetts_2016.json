  "transcript": "there are times when i feel really quite ashamed to be a european and our we mourn the tragic death of and yet we accept that tiny lebanon hosts more syrians and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to europe and yet we have repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers that separate children from their families and that seize property from refugees what are we doing how has the situation come to this that we 've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis or at least i don 't want to believe it 's because people don 't care i believe it 's because our politicians lack a vision a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over fifty years ago for a changing and globalized world so what i want to do is take a step back the two questions we all need to ask and second what can we do to fix it so the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath the second world war its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails or worse turns against its own people people have somewhere to go to live in safety and dignity until they can go home through an international convention convention on the status of refugees and an international organization refugees have a right to seek asylum in theory refugees or return to the country they 've come from geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world but not from a top down institutional perspective rather from the perspective of a refugee so imagine a syrian woman let 's call her amira amira to me represents many of the people i 've met in the region is a woman with children and she can 't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you homs a once beautiful and historic city and so amira can 't go back there but amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country so amira and her family the first option is that amira can take her family to a camp often in the desert in the zaatari refugee camp in jordan you can hear the shells across the border in syria at nighttime education is often of poor quality some eighty percent of refugees who are in camps have to stay for at least five years it 's a miserable existence and that 's probably why in reality only nine percent of syrians choose that option alternatively amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country like amman or beirut that 's an option that about but there there 's great difficulty as well so there 's a third and it 's one that increasing numbers of syrians are taking amira can seek some hope for her family we present refugees with an almost impossible three options encampment urban destitution and dangerous journeys the reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees and they 're not politicians frame the issue as a zero sum issue that if we benefit refugees we 're imposing costs on citizens but they don 't have to they can contribute so what i want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set the host states and communities all four ways have one thing in common mobility and markets and update the way we think about the refugee issue the first one i want to think about is the and it starts from a very basic recognition together with my colleagues in oxford we 've embarked on a research project in uganda we chose uganda not because it 's representative of all host countries it 's not it gives them freedom of movement and the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community we found that percent of refugees own a business that employs other people and forty percent of those employees are nationals of the host country we found extraordinary examples of vibrant flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses for example in a settlement called we found a rwandan who runs a business that 's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions against the odds of extreme constraint refugees are innovating and the gentleman you see before you is a and he 's now making films he made two documentary films with and for our team and he 's making a successful business out of very little rather than seeing refugees as but we need to also look beyond that we need to provide opportunities to connectivity access to capital and banking but there are still pragmatic and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government an idea to bring jobs to syrians while supporting jordan 's national development strategy the idea is for an economic zone is an existing economic zone called the king hussein bin talal development area but it lacked so what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to syria it could benefit refugees but it could also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of syria king abdullah has picked up on the idea it was announced at the london syria conference two weeks ago and a pilot the third idea that i want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring angela merkel and a syrian refugee but i 'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off my colleagues will jones and alex teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match but it 's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching the matching idea has been successfully used to match for instance students with university places it could we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities which makes no sense at all so matching markets offer a potential way to bring much of the tragedy and chaos we 've seen in europe was entirely avoidable it stems from a fundamental contradiction in europe 's asylum policy which is the following that in order to seek asylum in europe but why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline they led to the deaths of over three thousand people on europe 's borders and within european territory we would avoid that and there 's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to europe it costs two hundred euros to take a budget airline from bodrum to frankfurt it 's politics that prevents us doing that than a rational solution and this is an idea that has been applied enter brazil and claim refugee status on arrival in brazil every syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee there is a historical precedent for it as well nine hundred and forty two turks and chechens to travel across europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in europe and the nansen international refugee office received the nobel peace prize in recognition of this being so all four of these ideas that i 've presented you are ways in which we can expand amira 's choice set we really need a new vision a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don 't have to be a burden aspirations with the ability to make contributions if we let them migration is not going to go away what we 've seen in europe will be with us for many years people will continue to travel they but building on the opportunities offered by globalization markets and mobility thank you very much"
