  "transcript": "settlements typically began if you fly over you needed easy access to the fields it was a center of entertainment of energy production of work a center of health care that 's where babies were born and people died then with industrialization everything started to become centralized you had dirty factories that were moved to the outskirts of cities you had centralized energy production learning took place in schools health care took place in hospitals and then you had networks that developed you had water sewer networks you had separated functions increasingly you had rail networks that connected residential industrial commercial areas you had auto networks in fact the was really give everybody a car build roads to everything and give people a place to park when they get there it was not a very functional model and we still which you might call tower sprawl they 're all building cities on the model that which is really obsolete i would argue and there are hundreds and hundreds of new cities that are being planned all over the world three hundred million people some say four hundred million people will move to the city over the next fifteen years that means building the equivalent of the entire built infrastructure of the us in fifteen years imagine that and we should all care about this whether you live in cities cities or not cities will account for ninety percent of the population growth eighty percent of the global percent of energy use but at the same time it 's and that will just continue to escalate cities are places of celebration personal expression you have the flash mobs of pillow fights that i 've been to a couple they 're quite fun cities are where most most of the wealth is created and particularly in the developing world it 's where women find opportunities that 's a lot of the reason why cities are growing very quickly now there 's some trends that will impact cities first of all work is becoming distributed and mobile the office building is basically obsolete for doing private work once again because of distributed computation communication is becoming a center of life so it 's a center of production and learning and shopping and health care and all of and increasingly everything that people buy every consumer product in one way or another can be personalized and that 's a very important trend to think about so this is my image of the city of the future maybe not the way people dress but you know the question now is how can we have all the good things that we identify with cities without all the bad things this is bangalore it took me a couple of hours to get a few miles in bangalore last year so with cities you also have congestion and pollution and disease and all these negative things how can we have the good stuff paris was a series of these little villages that came together and you still see that structure today the twenty arrondissements of paris are these little neighborhoods most of what people need in life can be within a five or 10 minute walk and if you look at the data when you have that kind of a structure you get a very even distribution of the shops and the physicians and the pharmacies and the cafes in paris and then you look at cities that evolved after the automobile and it 's not that kind of a pattern there 's very little that 's within a five minute walk of most areas of places like pittsburgh not to pick on pittsburgh but most american cities really have have evolved so we said let 's start with that neighborhood cell we think of it as a compact urban cell so provide most of what most people want stewart brand and he might be right and then we we can form in effect a mesh network it 's something of an internet typology you can dial up the density about twenty thousand people per cell if it 's cambridge go up to fifty thousand if it 's manhattan density you connect everything with mass transit and you provide most of what most people need within that neighborhood you can begin to develop a whole typology of streetscapes and the the this is boulder it 's a great example of kind of a mobility parkway a superhighway for joggers and the high line in manhattan you have these rapidly emerging bike lanes all over the world i lived in manhattan for fifteen years i went back a couple of weekends ago took this photograph of these fabulous new bike lanes that they have installed they 're still not to where copenhagen is we actually did exactly the wrong thing in boston the big dig and it 's certainly not a mobility pathway for anything other than cars mobility on demand is something we 've been thinking about so we think we need an ecosystem of these shared use vehicles connected to mass transit these are some of the vehicles that we 've been working on but shared use is really key if you share a vehicle you can have at least four people use one vehicle as opposed to one we have hubway here in boston the vlib ' system in paris we 've been developing at the media lab this little city car that is optimized for shared use in cities we got rid of all the useless things like engines and that left the chassis unencumbered so you can do things like fold so you can fold this little vehicle up to occupy a tiny little footprint this was a video that was on european television last week showing the spanish minister of industry driving this little vehicle and when it 's can spin you don 't need reverse you don 't need parallel parking you just spin and go directly in so we 've been working with a company to commercialize this my phd student ryan chin presented these early ideas two years ago at a tedx conference you park at your destination you pat it on the butt it goes and it parks itself it charges itself and you can get something like seven times as many vehicles it 's not really a problem we can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like twenty eight times the land utilization with that kind of strategy how does a driverless car communicate you have nobody to make eye contact with you don 't know if it 's going to run you over so he 's developing strategies so the vehicle can communicate with pedestrians so so the headlights are eyeballs the pupils can dilate we have directional audio we can throw sound directly at people what i love about this project is he solved a problem that doesn 't exist yet so we also think that we can democratize access to bike lanes you know bike lanes are mostly used by young guys in stretchy pants so we think we can develop a vehicle that operates on bike lanes accessible to elderly and disabled businesspeople and address the issues of energy congestion mobility aging and obesity simultaneously that 's our you have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane but if you 're an older person that 's a switch if you 're a healthy person you might have to work really hard to go fast you can dial in forty calories going into work and five hundred going home when you can take a shower we hope to have that built this fall developers say ok we 'll build little teeny apartments people say we don 't really let 's build let 's bring advanced technology into the apartment infill give people the tools within this open loft chassis to go through a process of defining what their needs and values and activities are and then a matching algorithm will match a unique assembly of integrated infill components furniture and cabinetry that are personalized to that individual and they give them the tools to go through the process and to refine it and it 's something like working with an architect where the dialogue starts when you give an alternative to a person to react to now the most interesting implementation of that for us is when you can begin to have robotic walls so your your space can convert from exercise to a you have a conventional one bedroom arrangement when you need it maybe that 's most of the time you have a dinner party the table folds out to fit sixteen people in otherwise a conventional one bedroom or maybe you want a dance studio i mean architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time what to do now develop things that can scale we think we can make a very small apartment that functions as if it 's twice as big by utilizing these strategies i don 't believe in smart homes i think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it and so we 've been working on a chassis you know standardized platform with the motors we think this can all be standardized and then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall and like the car we can integrate all you won 't have a problem so the developers say well this is great ok so if we have a conventional building we have a fixed envelope maybe we can put in fourteen units if they function as if they 're twice as big we can get twenty eight units in that means twice as much parking though parking 's really expensive it 's about so if you can have you add shared use and you can even go further we can also integrate all kinds of advanced technology through this process there 's a path to market we have sensors on all the furniture all the infill that understands where people are and what they 're doing blue light is very efficient so we have these tunable fills out the light when necessary to full spectrum white light and saves maybe thirty forty percent in energy consumption we think over even conventional state of the art this just shows you the data that comes from the sensors that are embedded in the furniture we don 't really believe in cameras to do things in homes we think these little wireless sensors are more effective we think we can also personalize sunlight that 's sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways so we we 've looked at articulating mirrors of the facade that can throw shafts of sunlight in this case she picks up her phone she can map food preparation at the kitchen island to a particular location of maybe a third and you see everybody has their back to the wall and they have food they 're in their own little personal bubble we need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration we 're not doing a very good job with that i 've spent a lot of time in finland at the design factory of aalto university where the they have a shared shop and shared fab lab shared quiet spaces electronics spaces recreation we think ultimately all of this stuff can come together but in the end the main thing we need to focus on are people cities are all about people they 're places for people thank you"
