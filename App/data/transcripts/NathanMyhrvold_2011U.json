  "transcript": "i 've been interested in food for a long time i taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this i went to chef school in france and the world writes about food and learns about food but there 's some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established in the last twenty years people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food in fact understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking some of the chemistry and so forth there 's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed some about new aesthetics new approaches to food there 's a chef in spain avant garde cuisine none of them are taught in cooking schools and so a few years ago fours years ago actually i set out to say is there a way we can communicate science and technique so we tried and i 'll show you what we came up with and this magic view allows you to see all of what 's happening while the broccoli steams and the hope was two fold one is you can actually explain what but the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical maybe a little bit more scientific maybe a little bit more chef y than they otherwise would have because with that beautiful photo maybe i can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time steaming ought to and this explains that let 's do some more so here 's another one we discovered why woks are the shape they are but we had a philosophy which is it only has to look good for a thousandth and each of these text blocks explains a key thing that 's going on in this case boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic you don 't have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores can 't grow in the acid so this is great for vegetables which is what we 're canning here here 's our hamburger cutaway one of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish so you can lavish all the same care all the same technique on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish and if you do lavish as much technique as possible and you try to make the highest quality the new york times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called the wait for the 30 hour hamburger just got longer of course you 're not actually working the whole time most of the time is kind of sitting there the point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven 't seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers because char grilled taste doesn 't come from the wood or the charcoal buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing or burning so it 's the fat that drips down and flares and flares up that causes the characteristic taste now you might wonder how do we make these cutaways most people assume we use photoshop and the answer is no not really we use a machine shop so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world we cut a $ five thousand restaurant oven in half the manufacturer said what would it take for you to cut one in half i said it would have to show up free now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots we would glue a piece of pyrex or heat resistant glass in front so it 's very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air supported by wires and then they take the wires away digitally so you 're flying through the air in most cases though there was no glass like for the the one of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way but hey they grow back in addition to cutaways we also we have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it but to make them palatable we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this we 've got lots of little tidbits in the book but now you will we put a biography of james watt in paragraphs we also did a lot of calculation i personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook here 's a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue or other radiant heat goes as you move away from it so as you move vertically away from this surface the heat falls off as you move side to side it moves off that horn shaped region is what we call the sweet spot that 's the place where the heat is even to within ten percent so that 's the place where you really want to cook and it 's got this funny horn shaped thing which as far as i know again the first cookbook to ever do this now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it you know there 's two ways you can make a product you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it here 's a step by step that shows grinding hamburger if you really want great hamburger it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain it 's really simple as you can see here as it comes out of the grinder you just have a little tray and you just build it up slice it vertically here 's the final hamburger this is the 30 hour hamburger we make every aspect of this burger the lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it there 's a mushroom ketchup it goes on and on now watch closely this is popcorn here the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics isn the key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of one thousand six hundred that 's what 's happening to the water inside that popcorn so it 's a let 's put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around pretty soon somebody does this now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot that 's why you shouldn 't get shot the other amazing thing is when this ballistics gelatin comes down it falls back down as a nice block anyway here 's the book friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen so there 's a sixth volume that has washable waterproof paper"
