  "transcript": "my favorite part of being a dad is the movies i get to watch and when my daughter was four we got to watch the wizard of oz together totally dominated her imagination for months her favorite character was glinda of course it gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand and you start to realize how unusual it is now we live today and are raising our children in a kind of children another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy 's guards do you know what i 'm talking about yeah now there 's a big difference between these two movies a couple of really big differences between the wizard of oz and all the movies we watch today one is there 's very little violence in wizard of oz the but use your magic slippers to defeat the another thing that 's really unique about the wizard of oz to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female now i started to notice this when i actually showed star wars to my daughter he was only three at the time he was not invited to and the level of supervision had plummeted so and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling i don 't think he understands what 's going on but and i wonder what he 's soaking in is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government and of course but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe which he does by making friends with everybody and being a leader that 's kind of the world i 'd rather raise my kids in which is where we kind of have to be why is there so much force capital f force in the movies we have for our kids and so little yellow brick road there is a lot of great writing about the impact i know from my own experience that princess leia did not provide the adequate context that i could have used in navigating the adult world that i really expected the credits to start rolling why are you still standing there it 's almost as though if you 're a boy you are a dopey animal and if you are a girl you should bring your warrior costume but they do send a message to boys that they are not the boys are not really the target audience and as three dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are these are still war movies of course the most successful studio of all time or or this year when they finally came out with brave i recommend it to all of you it 's on demand now do you remember what the critics said when brave came out aw i can 't believe pixar made a princess movie it 's very good don 't let that stop you now almost none of these movies pass the bechdel test i don 't know if you 've heard of this it has not yet caught on and caught fire but maybe today we will start a movement alison bechdel is a comic book artist and back in the mid ' 80s she recorded this conversation she 'd had with a friend and it 's very simple there 's just three questions you should ask is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines so try to meet that bar and do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like and yet i very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love in fact this week i went to see a very high quality oscar buzz doing great at the box office a consensus idea of what a quality hollywood film is it pretty much a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and you coming to bed honey that 's hollywood for you so let 's let 's look at the numbers two thousand and eleven of the one hundred most popular movies how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists eleven it 's not bad 's not as many percent as the number of women we 've just elected to congress so that 's good but there is a number that is greater than this that 's going to bring this room down last year the new york times published a study that the government had done here 's what it said one out of five women in america say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life i don 't think kids movies have anything to do with that i don 't even think that and when i hear that statistic one of the things i think of is that 's a lot of sexual assailants who are these guys what are they learning what are they failing to learn are they absorbing the story that a male hero 's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward which is a woman who has no friends and doesn 't speak are we soaking up that story as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them we have tools at our disposal like girl power but i gotta wonder is girl power going to protect actively or passively we are training our sons i mean i think the netflix queue and i 'm talking mainly to the dads here i think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood the definition of manhood is already you 've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner they 're throwing it up in the air how a real man is someone who trusts his and i think our job in the netflix queue is to look out for those movies and to seek out the heroines who are there and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say i want to be on their team because they 're going to be on their team the wizard of oz"
