  "transcript": "this is an image of me and my daughter i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted a few days i was sitting waiting and the client was saying no it 's ten thousand a day it 's like every year it 's if we don 't act now it 's too late forever for ten and it 's another day i woke up because i 'm always waking up in the night which i 've never seen before and i was like what 's going on most of them i don 't know and a few of them so i start answering this and she 's telling me she saw the poster and so i 'm like whoa and everybody 's crying now so i don 't know what to do so my first reflex as a graphic designer you know to show everybody what i 'd just seen and people started to see them and to share them and that 's how it started so this is her laughter because put me in a poster now it 's about people from israel who want to say something so i 'm going to shoot all the so i went to my neighbors and friends and students and i just asked them 's tell the iranians we from israel love you too it became you know at some point it was really really intense friends to come so for a few days that 's how my living room was and we received but also lots of comments lots of this one is really moving for me because it 's the story of a girl who has been raised in iran to walk on on an israeli flag to enter her school every morning and now and she wished that we 'd meet and come to visit one another and just a few days after i posted the first poster they have graphic designers what crazy crazy so you can see they are still shy they don 't want to show their faces but they want to spread the message they want to respond they want to say the same thing so and now it 's it 's a two way story and this is and suddenly people on facebook are starting to say i love those guys and then you see only the bad so the guys on the news they say okay let 's talk about this and it was so much i remember one day michal she was talking with the journalist and she was asking him who 's gonna see the show and he said and we were just at the beginning of the story something crazy also happened every time a country started talking about it like germany america wherever a page on facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories so at the beginning we had which is an iranian sitting in tehran this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message to people sending their love one to each other the moment i really understood that something was happening a friend of mine told me google the word ' israel ' and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google when you were typing israel or iran we really changed how people and for a few days you got those images so for five months now that 's what we are doing me michal a few of my friends are just making images we 're showing a new reality they see end of story this is the page this is not this is a guy in tehran on the day of remembrance of the israeli and we 're understanding and you show compassion and you become friends and at some point you become and i went there to open an exposition about iran and i met there with people from the page that told me okay you 're going to be in europe i 'm coming i 'm coming from france from holland and we just met there for the first time in real life i met with people that are supposed to be my enemies and we and it goes the other way around some girl that we met on facebook afraid decides after a few months of talking on the internet not that big a deal so we start this new campaign called it 's plus minus the same message but we wanted really to to add some aggressivity to it the same ones who were shy we are with you just read where those guys are from and for every guy from israel just people sending their pictures may ask yourself who is this dude my name is ronny edry and i 'm forty one i 'm an israeli i 'm a i 'm teaching graphic many times i 've been asked yeah but i mean i was in the paratroopers for three years and i know how it looks from the ground i know how this is the courageous thing to do to try to reach the other because when it 's going to be too late it 's going to be too late and sometimes war is inevitable sometimes but maybe [ and maybe that little thing can change something and really we can be our own ambassadors we can just send a message and hope for the best so i want to ask michal my wife to come with me on the stage just and maybe that image"
