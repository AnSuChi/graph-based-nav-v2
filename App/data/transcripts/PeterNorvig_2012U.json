  "transcript": "and this is me teaching introduction to artificial to two hundred students at stanford university now the students and i enjoyed the class but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern the teaching technology isn 't note the textbook the sage on the stage and the sleeping guy in the back we challenged ourselves to create an online class that would be equal or better in quality fifty thousand people had signed up for it and that grew to one hundred and sixty thousand students from two hundred and nine countries and just a bit terrified that we hadn 't finished preparing the class yet we studied what others had done what we could copy and what we could change benjamin bloom had showed that one on one tutoring works best so that 's what we tried to emulate like with me and my mom even though we knew it would be here an overhead video camera is recording me as i 'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper but are and that 's exactly what we were aiming for and then we pause for a quiz and here there 's a pause and the student has to reflect understand what 's going on and check the right boxes before they can continue we mostly avoid questions like here 's a formula now tell me the value of y when x is equal to two we preferred open ended questions one student wrote now i 'm seeing bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere i look we wanted to change the way they looked at the world and we succeeded and in doing so we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional you may not ever get around to it so we brought back the innovation of having due dates you could watch the videos and it also meant so if you went into a discussion forum you could get an answer from a peer within minutes and then they come together to discuss them from eric mazur i learned about peer instruction sebastian and i have forgotten some of from teach for america i learned that a class is not primarily about information more important is motivation and determination it was crucial that the students see so what have we learned sebastian 's teaching another class now i 'll do one in the fall stanford coursera udacity mitx and others have more classes coming it 's a really exciting time"
