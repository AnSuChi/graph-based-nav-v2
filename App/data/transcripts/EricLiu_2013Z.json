  "transcript": "teacher and a practitioner of civics in america now i will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep to please wake up why is it that the very word civics has such a soporific even a narcoleptic effect on us i think it 's because well i think it 's the responsibility of people like us people who show up for gatherings like this in person or online in any way we can to make civics sexy again as sexy as it was during the as sexy as it was during the civil rights movement and i believe the way we make civics sexy again is to make explicitly about the teaching of power the way we do that i believe this is what i want to talk about today and i want to start by defining some terms and then i want to describe the scale of the problem i think we face and then suggest the ways that i believe cities can be the seat of the solution by civics i simply mean the art of being a contributor in a self governing community civics is the art of citizenship what bill gates sr calls simply and it encompasses three things a foundation of values an understanding of the systems that make the world go round and a set of skills that allow you to pursue goals and to have others join in that pursuit and which is simply this the capacity to make others do what you would have them do it sounds menacing we find it somehow evil we period end of story any further inquiry not necessary and not really that welcome power has a negative moral valence it sounds machiavellian inherently it seems inherently evil but in fact power is no more inherently good or evil than fire or physics it just is and power governs how any form of government operates whether a democracy or a dictatorship and the problem we face today here in america in particular but all around the world is that far too many people are profoundly illiterate in power power what part of it is visible what part of it is not why some people have it why that 's compounded and as a result of this illiteracy those few who do understand how power operates in civic those who understand how a bill becomes a law yes but also how a friendship becomes a subsidy or how a slogan becomes a movement the people who understand those things this is why it is so fundamental for us right now to grab hold of this idea of power and to democratize it one of the things that is so profoundly exciting and challenging about this moment there is a concentration of knowledge of understanding seamlessly when a senior government official decides to leave government and become a lobbyist for a private interest and convert his or her relationships into capital for their new masters insidiously virally in the way that the tea party for instance was able to take the don 't tread on me flag or how on the other side a band of activists could take a magazine headline occupy wall street and turn that into a global meme and movement the thing is though most people so much of this ignorance this civic illiteracy is willful there are some millennials for instance who think the whole business is just sordid they don 't want to have anything to do with there are some techies out there who believe that the cure all for any power imbalance or power abuse is simply more data there are some on the left who think power resides only with corporations and some on the right who think power resides only with government each side blinded by their selective there are the naive who believe that good things just happen and the cynical who believe that bad things just happen the fortunate and unfortunate alike who think that their lot is simply what they deserve rather than the eminently alterable result of a prior arrangement an inherited allocation of power awareness money people outreach people message people research people we become this problem and i believe that when you have this kind of disengagement this willful ignorance it becomes both a cause and a consequence of this concentration of opportunity of wealth and clout that i was describing a moment ago this profound this is why it is so important in our time right now perhaps it 's never been more important at any time if people don 't learn power people don 't wake up don 't wake up they get left out part of the art of practicing power means being awake and having a voice but it also is about having an arena where you can plausibly practice in an arena which is simply that there is no better arena in our time for the practicing it can be something small where a street lamp should go or something medium like which library should have its hours extended or cut or maybe something bigger like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be turned into a highway or a greenway or whether all the businesses in your town should be required to pay a living wage think about the change that you want in your city and then think about how you would get it how you would make it happen the threat of force the force of norms all of these of power are at play now think about how you would activate or perhaps neutralize this is not some game of thrones empire level set of questions these are questions that play out in every single place on the planet i 'll voters not too long ago approved a process to replace the private power company literally the power company the electric company xcel with a publicly owned utility and xcel has now put in play a ballot measure that would undermine or undo this and so the citizen activists in boulder who have been pushing this now literally have to fight the power in order to fight for power and it draws from the machine has dominated student government elections and they 've engineered the election of a former machine member a young pro business recent graduate to the tuscaloosa city school board now as i say these are just two examples drawn almost at random but you cannot help but admire the power literacy of the players involved their skill you cannot help but reckon with and recognize the command they have of the elemental questions of civic power what tactics what is the terrain who are your enemies who are your allies now i want you to return return could you put into practice effectively what it is that you know we live in a time right now where here in the united states the national government has tied itself and this great innovation this great wave and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live consider the ways that strategies for making cities more bike friendly have spread so rapidly from copenhagen to new york to austin to boston to seattle think about how experiments in participatory budgeting where everyday citizens get a chance to allocate and decide upon the allocation those experiments have spread from porto alegre brazil migrant workers from rome to los angeles and many cities between are now organizing to stage strikes to remind the people who live in their cities what a members of the new citizens ' movement and they 're drawing the ire of officials there but they 're also drawing the attention of anti corruption activists all around the world in seattle where i 'm from we 've become part of a great global array of cities that are now working together bypassing government altogether national government altogether in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals of the kyoto protocol all of these citizens united are forming a web a great archipelago of power that allows us to bypass brokenness and monopolies of and our task now is to accelerate this work our task now is to bring more and more people into the fold of this work that 's why my organization citizen university has undertaken a project now to create an everyman 's curriculum in civic power and this curriculum starts with this triad that i described earlier of values systems and skills like to do is to invite all of you to help create this curriculum with the stories and the experiences and the challenges that each of you lives and faces to create something powerfully collective and i want to invite you in particular to try a simple exercise drawn and you can date it set it out one year from now five years from now a decade from now a generation from now and write it as a case study looking back looking back at the cause that you were championing and describing the ways that that change and that cause came in fact to succeed the values of your fellow citizens that you activated and the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir how to navigate diversity in conflict all those skills that enabled you to bring folks on board and to overcome resistance what you 'll be doing when you write that narrative so share what you write do you what you write and then share what you do i invite you to literally share the narratives that you create but even beyond that it 's in the conversations that we have today all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings that are happening on this topic at this moment and to think about how we can become one another 's teachers and students in power we do that then together we can make civics sexy again together we can create a great network of city we have the power to do that thank you very much"
