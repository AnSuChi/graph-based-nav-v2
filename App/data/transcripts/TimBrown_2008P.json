  "transcript": "a guy named bob mckim he was a creativity researcher in the ' 60s and ' 70s and also led the stanford design program and in fact my friend and ideo studied under him at stanford and he liked to do an exercise with his students you all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper and i want you to pick somebody thats seated next to you and when i say go youve got thirty seconds to draw your neighbor seconds youd better be fast come on those masterpieces i think i probably am mckim found this every time he did it with his students he got exactly the same he would point this out as evidence and that were embarrassed about showing our ideas to to people we think of as our peers to those around us and this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our ok so if you try the same exercise with kids they have no embarrassment at all they just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever whoever wants to but as they learn to become adults they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed and in studies of of kids playing its been shown time after time that who are in a kind of trusted environment theyre the ones that feel then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of david said that what he wanted to do was to form a company that wasnt just and and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers and so that decision to work with his friends now he has five hundred and fifty of them was was what got and our studios like i think many creative workplaces today are designed to help people comfortable with the people that theyre working with i think weve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful or at pixar where the animators work in and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on so they have the slide and they even have a our big symbol and its actually something that we invented a few years ago or created a few years ago its a toy youll find something taped underneath it thats great if you could pass it up thanks david i appreciate it and and im going to run a little experiment another little experiment but before we start i need just to put these on thank you all right now so the way they work is you know you just my only recommendation here i want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage theyre still coming in from the back there theyre still coming in some of you havent fired them yet can you not figure out how to do it or something its not that hard most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first ten seconds when they pick it up all okay all right lets i suppose we 'd better i the rest of you can save them for when i say something particularly boring and then you can fire at me all right i think im going to take these off now because i cant see a damn thing when ive all right you know why do we have them well as i said we have them because we think maybe playfulness we use it in a pretty pragmatic way to be honest we think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions helps us do our jobs better and helps us feel better when when we do them now an adult encountering a new situation when we encounter a new situation we we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can you know and theres a reason for that i suspect that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons [ for ] why we want to categorize new things very very quickly one of them might be you know when we see this funny stripy thing is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us or is it just some weird shadows on the tree we need to figure that out pretty fast well at least we did once most of us dont need to anymore i suppose this is some aluminum foil right you use it in the kitchen thats what it is now theyll certainly when they come across something new theyll certainly ask what is it of course they will but theyll also ask what can i do with it and you know and this openness is the beginning of exploratory play any parents of young kids in the audience and you know from an exploration perspective tickle me elmo which despite its ingenuity so again this is another one of those playful activities that as we get older we tend to forget and we have to relearn so another one of bob mckims favorite exercises is called the thirty circles test so were back to work you guys are going to get back to work again turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over and youll find those and i want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form so for example you could turn one into a football or another one into a sun all im interested in is quantity i want you to do as many of them as you can in the minute that im just about to give you so everybody ready hopefully everybody more than ten keep your hands up if you did ten fifteen anybody get all thirty no oh somebody did fantastic anybody do that cool so i was really interested in quantity i wasnt actually very interested in whether they were all different i just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible and one of the things we tend to do as adults again is we edit things we stop ourselves from doing things we self edit as were having ideas and in some cases our desire to be original and that actually isnt necessarily really really playful so that ability just to just to go for it and explore its the peyote mckim published a paper in one thousand nine describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity them to come along one evening and to bring a problem with them that they that they were working on and had them listen to some nice relaxing music for a while and then he did whats called the purdue how many uses can you find for a paper clip its basically the same thing as the thirty circles thing that i just had you do now actually he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs to see what the difference was in peoples and then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that and so some of the things that they figured out some of these individuals figured out in one case a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients a design of a solar space probe experiment a redesign of the linear electron accelerator an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder you can tell this is a while ago and even a new conceptual model of the photon so it was a pretty successful evening but really it wasnt the drugs and getting them but its hard to break our habits our adult habits edicts like defer judgment can you have rules about creativity it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process and weve certainly learnt that over time you get much better brainstorming much more creative outcomes achieve this is in a much more organic way i think the are wonderful examples of experimentation and they experimented with they were exploring following what was interesting to them they went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war i think and from this experiment they moved on to chairs through constant experimentation with materials they developed a wide range of iconic solutions then we wouldnt be the beneficiaries of so many wonderful designs today from films to buildings from games to graphics so theyre great examples i think of exploration and experimentation in design now while the and they were doing that through building prototypes and building is the next of the behaviors that i thought id talk about so the average western first grader spends as much as fifty percent of their play time taking part in whats called construction but also a powerful way to learn when play is about building a tower out of blocks the kid begins to learn a lot about towers and as they repeatedly knock it down and start again learning is happening as a sort of by product of play its classically learning by doing david kelley calls this behavior when its carried out by designers thinking with your hands and it typically involves making multiple low resolution prototypes very quickly often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution the team was kind of stuck and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together that became the first commercial computer mouse for the apple lisa and the macintosh learned their way to that by building by building prototypes they were meeting with them they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device and one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium and a clothespin he taped them all together ran back into the room and said you mean something like this and the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said well i want to hold it like this or like that and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible and in the end it turned into a real device and so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world and having your thinking advanced as a result filled with colored paper and play doh and glue sticks and stuff i mean they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them but the important idea is that everythings at hand everythings around so when designers are working on ideas they can start building stuff whenever they want they dont necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal and then the sad thing is although preschools are full of this kind of stuff as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away they lose this stuff that facilitates this sort maybe the best construction tool we have might be the but by giving project teams and quite complex ideas can can this is a nurse using a very simple as you can see plasticine explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital and just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if were trying to describe them through through words but what about designing something that isnt physical something like a service or an experience something that exists as a series of interactions over time instead of of building play this can be approached with role play so if youre designing an interaction between two people such as i dont know ordering food at a fast food joint or something you need to be able to imagine how that experience and i think the best way to achieve that and get a feeling for any flaws in your design is to act it out i think where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems and this is another example in a healthcare many adults are pretty reluctant to engage with role play some of its embarrassment and some of it is because they just dont believe that what emerges is necessarily valid they dismiss an interesting interaction by saying you know thats just happening because theyre acting it out research into kids ' behavior actually suggests that its worth if one kid plays store and another ones playing house then the whole kind of play falls down so they get used to quite quickly to to understanding the rules for social so when as adults we role play then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized weve gone through lots of experiences in life at spotting whether something lacks quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences another way for us as designers to explore role play is to put ourselves through an experience which were designing for and so they grabbed some very simple quite small places on on airplanes this is one of our designers kristian simsarian and hes putting himself through the experience of being an er patient now this is a real hospital in a real emergency room one of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didnt want the doctors and nurses thinking he went there with his video camera and its kind of interesting to see what he brought back because when we when we looked at the video when he got back we saw twenty minutes of this and also the amazing thing about this about this video as soon as you see it you immediately project know what it feels like all of that uncertainty while youre left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case and so this notion of using or another one of our designers altay sendil hes here having his chest waxed not because hes very vain although actually he is no im kidding but in order to empathize with and so sometimes these analogous experiences analogous role play can also be quite valuable so and so the idea of we kind of admire people who do this at ideo anyway not just because they lead to insights about the experience but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience in short we admire their willingness to play playful exploration playful building and role play those are some of the ways that designers and so far i admit and to certain extent it is i want to stress a couple of points the first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy play has rules especially when its group play when kids play tea party or they play cops and robbers theyre following a script that theyve agreed to and its this code negotiation so remember the sketching task we did at the beginning the kind of little face portrait you did well imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub but everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks that framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing difficult situation into a fun game as a result all feel perfectly secure and and have a good but there arent just obviously as designers we need to be able to transition in and out of play also and if were running design studios we need to be able to figure out how can we transition designers through i think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of i think whats very different about design we go through and then we come back together again i think theyre two quite different modes and i think its probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious and so being able to move between those modes is really really a more nuanced version view of play i think is required because its very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute youre either playful or youre serious and you cant be both but its not an either or they include exploration which is about going for quantity building and thinking with your where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which were designing and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic"
