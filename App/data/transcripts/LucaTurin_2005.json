  "transcript": "the fragrance that you will smell you will never be able to smell this way again its a fragrance called beyond paradise which you can find in any store in the nation except here its been split up in parts by este lauder and i 'm most grateful to them for this and its been split up in successive bits and a chord so what youre smelling now the lush heart note i will show it to you u k melaleuca bark note which does not contain any melaleuca bark because its totally forbidden and that the complete fragrance now what you are smelling is a combination of i asked how many and its about four hundred so what youre smelling is several hundred molecules floating through the air hitting your nose and do not get the impression that this is very subjective you are all smelling pretty much the same thing ok smell has this reputation of being somewhat now while the smell wafts let me tell you the history of an idea everything that youre smelling in here is made up of atoms that come from what i call the upper east side of the periodic table a nice safe neighborhood you really dont want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery some people have tried in the 1920s to add things from the bad parts and it didnt really work these are the five atoms from which just about everything that youre going to smell in real life from coffee to fragrance are made of the top note that you smelled at the very beginning the cut grass green what we call in perfumery theyre weird terms and this would be called a green note because it smells of something green like cut grass this is and i had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years a very expensive high school chemistry education this has six carbon atoms so now this is the skeleton of the molecule if you dress it up with atoms hydrogen atoms thats what it looks like when you have it on your computer but actually its sort of more like this in the sense that the atoms have a certain why does this thing smell why doesnt it smell of potatoes or violets well there are really two theories but the first theory is it must be the shape and thats a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology enzymes that chew things up antibodies its all you know the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing in this case a smell now this is a totally insane idea and when i first came however i came to realize gradually that they may be right heres how shape works in in normal receptors you have a molecule coming in it gets into the protein which is schematic here and it causes this thing to switch to turn to move in some way by binding whats wrong with shape is summarized in this slide the way i expect everybody to memorize these compounds working for a fragrance company hes making forty five molecules and hes looking for a sandalwood something that smells of sandalwood because theres a lot of money in sandalwoods and this is an awful lot of work this actually so this is a profoundly inefficient process and my definition of a theory is its not just something that you teach people its labor saving a theory so let me explain to you why a very simple fact that tells you you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs this is conversely there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka its very hard to explain this by molecular recognition now i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology and he says thats easy the things are a different color color we have to go a little beyond that now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it these molecules as you saw in the beginning the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other in fact molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them so this is the sound of the o h stretch translated into the audible range s h quite a different frequency now this is kind of interesting because nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except that frequency except s h if you look on this so i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story i went searching for a type of molecule any molecule that would have that vibration and that the obvious prediction after i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane which has exactly the same vibration now the good news is boranes you can get hold of the bad news is theyre rocket fuels ok so and they wouldnt have liked it at my s h now does it smell of sulfur if you go back in the literature theres a man who knew more about boranes than anyone alive then or since alfred stock he synthesized all of them and in an enormous paper in german he says at one point my wife is german and she translated it for me and at one point he says ganz widerlich geruch an absolutely repulsive smell which is good reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide so this fact that boranes smell of sulfur had been known since and its fair to say that if you look up somebodys nose youre unlikely to see anything resembling this and this is the main objection to the theory ok great we smell vibrations how unlike biologists this is a joke im a biologist ok so its a joke against myself bob jacklovich and john lamb at ford motor company in the days when ford motor was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research discovered a a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically i could do the the dance of electron tunneling but ive done a video instead which and they can jump across unlike us they wont fall off the cliff if something absorbs the energy the electron can travel so here you have a system you have something and theres plenty of that stuff in biology some substance giving an electron and the electron tries to jump and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen ok is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built and every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology if you have a philosophical bent of mind is that then it tells you that the nose and then a magnificent thing happened i left academia and joined the real world of business and a company was created around my ideas to make new molecules using my method along the lines of lets put someone elses money where your mouth is and one of the first things that happened was we started going around to fragrance companies asking if you could calculate smell you dont need chemists you need a computer a mac will do it if you know how to and so thats a direct path to making new odorants and one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in france and heres where i do my charles fleischer impression and one of them says you cannot make a coumarin he says to me i bet you cannot make a coumarin now coumarin is a very common thing and the problem is its a carcinogen so nobody likes particularly and so we started doing calculations and the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin and you smooth it out so that you have a nice and then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules and we actually in this case im because i got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said look ive just found this such a beautiful reaction that even if this compound doesnt smell of coumarin i want to do it its just such a nifty and you get this lovely crystalline compound let us try it and i said first of all let me do the calculation bottom right which is related to coumarin but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule the white and and this is our new and people are very resistant to ideas and rightly so why should new ideas be when you put a little vial on the table in front of perfumers and youve found it in three weeks this focuses everybodys mind wonderfully and people often ask me is your theory accepted and i said well by whom i mean youre right and i dont know why which is the most rational one at this point youre right and i dont care were dealing with people who only want results and this is the commercial world and they tell us that even if we do it by astrology theyre happy but for the last three years ive had what i consider to be the best job in the entire universe which is to put my hobby which is you know self taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works"
