  "transcript": "yet only breaks me down i march down hallways cleaned up after me every day by regular janitors but i never have the decency to honor their names lockers left open like teenage boys ' mouths when teenage girls wear clothes that covers their insecurities but exposes everything else masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons part like the red sea when the bell rings this diverse and segregated on purpose trained at a young age to capitalize letters this is a training ground because the truth is hard to swallow the need for degrees has left so many but when you go home every day and your home is work you don 't want to pick up any assignments reading textbooks is stressful but reading does not matter when you feel your story is already at what they 're built to do to train you to keep you on track to track down an american dream that has failed so many of us all"
