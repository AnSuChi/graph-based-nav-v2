  "transcript": "when i was a student here in oxford in the 1970s the future of the world was bleak the population explosion was unstoppable global famine was inevitable a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives the acid rain was falling on the forests the desert was advancing by a mile or two a year the oil was running out and a nuclear winter would finish us off none of those things happened and astonishingly if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime the average per capita income in real terms adjusted for inflation has tripled child mortality is down by per capita food production is up by a third and all this at a time when the population has doubled how did we achieve that whether you think it 's a good thing or not how did we achieve that how did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous the size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population and the level of the graph represents gdp per capita i think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings need to understand how ideas have sex i want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this these are both real objects one is an acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by homo erectus they 're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny the differences are what interest me because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years from one and a half million years ago to half a million years ago thirty thousand generations of and there 's another difference too which is the object on the left is made from one substance the object on the right is made from a confection of different substances from silicon and metal and plastic and so on and because i think it 's the secret to understanding what 's happening in the world they 've come together how does evolution do cumulative then it 's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different it 's not confined to its own lineage what 's the process that 's having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution and i think the answer is exchange the habit of exchanging one thing for another it 's a unique human feature no other animal does it you can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange and indeed there 's reciprocity in other animals but the exchange of one object for another never happens as adam smith said no man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog you can have as it were asexual culture chimpanzees killer whales these kinds of creatures they have culture they teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring in this case chimpanzees teaching each other to crack nuts with rocks but the difference is that and the reason is because there is no sex as it were there is no exchange of ideas chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops there 's no exchange of ideas between them and why does exchange raise living standards well the answer came from david ricardo in seventeen and here is a stone age version of his story although he told it in terms of trade between countries adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam he doesn 't need adam he can make his own spears and axes well no because if you think about it if oz makes two spears and adam make two axes and then they trade then they will each have saved an hour of work and the more they do this the more true it 's going to be so the gains from trade are only going to grow and this is one of the beauties of exchange is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on time in satisfying your needs ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by if you had to start from scratch let 's say you go out into the countryside you find a sheep you kill it you get the fat out of it you render it down you make a candle etc etc how long is it going to take you quite long time how long do you actually have to work to back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light or you can acquire acquire another you 'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour in other words the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in one thousand eight hundred go back to this image of the axe and the mouse and ask yourself who made them and for who the stone axe was made by someone for himself it but the object on the right was made for me by other people how many other people tens hundreds thousands you know because you 've got to include the man who grew the coffee which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig who was drilling for oil which was going to be made into the plastic etc they were all working for me to make a mouse for me that 's the way society works that 's what in the old days if you were rich you literally had people working for you that 's how you got to be rich you employed them louis xiv had a lot of people working for him they made his silly outfits like this and they did his silly hairstyles or whatever he had four hundred and ninety eight people to prepare his dinner every night a modern tourist going around the palace of versailles and looking at louis xiv 's pictures and that 's what we 've done because we 're all working for each other we 're able to to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other 's living standards and the reason for that is because there 's a reproductive division of labor that is to say they specialize with respect to the queen does it all in our species we don 't like doing that it 's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves is reproduction we don 't leave reproduction to the queen i think probably the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor but i 've got no evidence for that it just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male there 's a foraging division of labor between on the whole hunting males and gathering females it isn 't always quite that simple but there 's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females and the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides the woman knows that in the hadzas ' case here digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat and she doesn 't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog and the man knows that he doesn 't have to do any digging to get roots all he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it 's big enough to share some and so both sides raise each other 's standards of living through the sexual division of labor when did this happen probably because we know they had the foxp2 gene of the same kind as us which was discovered here in oxford and so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills they were brilliant people i 'm not dissing the neanderthals because the objects that you find in neanderthal remains the tools they made are always made from local materials it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups trade and the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between eighty and one hundred and twenty thousand years ago in africa when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in you also see seashells and that 's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups and that will have led to specialization how do you know that long distance movement means trade rather than migration well you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals who quarried for stone axes at a place called mount isa which was a quarry owned by the kalkadoon tribe so long distance movement of tools is a sign of trade not migration what happens when you cut people off from exchange you can actually throw it into reverse they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about four thousand people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the it didn 't happen in tierra del fuego similar island similar people the tasmanians were isolated go back to this image again and ask yourself not only who made it and for who but who knew how to make it in the president of the computer mouse company doesn 't know he just knows how to run a run a company the person on the assembly line doesn 't know because he doesn 't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic and so on we all know little bits but none of us knows the whole 1950s called i pencil in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil and what we 've done in human society through exchange and specialization is we 've created the ability to do things that we don 't even understand it 's not the same with language with language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other but with with technology we can actually do things and by the way i q s than other groups it 's completely irrelevant what 's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas and how well they 're cooperating not how clever the individuals are it 's the interchange of ideas the meeting and mating of ideas between them that is causing incrementally bit by bit however bad things happen and in the future as we go forward we will i 'm also sure because through the cloud through crowd sourcing through the bottom up world that we 've created where not just the elites elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate thank you"
