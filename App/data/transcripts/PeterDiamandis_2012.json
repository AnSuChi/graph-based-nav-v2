  "transcript": "in the wake of bin laden 's death have spiked so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that and there 's a very good reason for that every second of every day our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains and because nothing is more important to us than survival the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala now the amygdala is our early warning detector it sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us so given a dozen news stories we will preferentially look at the negative news and that old newspaper saying if it bleeds it leads is very true so given all of our digital devices it 's no wonder that we 're pessimistic it 's the distortions brought to us of what 's really going on perhaps the tremendous progress we 've made over the last century by a series of forces are in fact accelerating to a point that we have potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance now i 'm not saying we don 't have our set of problems but ultimately we knock them down so let 's look at what this last century has been to see where we 're going the average human lifespan has more than doubled add to that the we truly are living in an extraordinary time and we keep setting our expectations higher and the majority of people under the poverty line the wealthiest robber barons of the last century the emperors on this planet could have never dreamed of such luxuries underpinning much of this exponentially growing technologies and experiences price performance doubling that 's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the ' 70s now look at this curve number one how smooth it is through good time and bad time war time and peace time recession depression and boom time this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster and on this curve riding on moore 's law are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us cloud computing what my friends at autodesk digital medicine nanomaterials and a i i mean how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm 's watson i mean that was epic in fact i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could and i love this watson vanquishes human opponents think about that the fact that literally a group of students can touch the lives thirty years ago that would have sounded ludicrous today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that scarcity is contextual and technology is a so this is a story of napoleon iii in the he invited over to dinner the king of siam he was fed with aluminum utensils it 's the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made even though aluminum is eight point three percent of the earth by mass it 's all bound by oxygen and silicates but then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap so let 's project this analogy going forward we think sixteen terawatts of energy hits the earth 's surface every eighty eight minutes it and there 's good news here for the first time this electricity in india eight point eight rupees versus seventeen rupees the cost of solar dropped fifty percent last year last month mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to fifteen cents as a national average and if we have abundant energy we also have abundant water now we talk about water wars do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft he took a famous photo what was it called we live on a planet seventy percent covered by water right now and the conversation i had the great diy innovators i 'd like to share with you he gave me permission to do so it 's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source saltwater polluted water latrine the chairman has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world and if that pans out which i have every confidence it will coca cola will deploy this globally to two hundred and six countries around the planet and we 've seen this in cellphones think about it that a masai warrior on a cellphone and if they 're on a smartphone on google they 've got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did fifteen years ago they 're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted that the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for medical diagnostic technology are now literally dematerializing probably the best part of it is what 's coming down the pike in health health we 're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to because it 's got a i you can cough on it you can do a finger blood prick and to win it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of so literally imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors twenty five percent of the disease burden and one point three percent of the health care workers it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the but here here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance i call it the rising billion and by the way the biggest protection against a population explosion connected by two thousand and twenty that 's going from two billion to five billion internet users three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation what will these people want what will they consume what will they desire and rather than having economic shutdown we 're about to have the biggest economic injection ever these people represent tens of trillions of dollars and by literally being able to use so what could three billion rising healthy educated productive members of humanity bring to us how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before wherever they might be the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever what will these three billion people bring the one thing i 've learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past let me share and close with a story that really got me excited there is a program that some of you might have heard of it 's a game called foldit it came out of the university of washington in seattle and this is a game where individuals can actually and this game has been played by university professors and so forth and and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world it wasn 't a caltech student it was a person from england from manchester a woman who during the day ladies and gentlemen what gives me tremendous confidence in the future we have the tools with this we have the passion of the diy innovator we have the capital of the techno philanthropist and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges to do that which we must do"
