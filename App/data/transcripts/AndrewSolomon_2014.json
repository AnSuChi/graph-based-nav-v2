  "transcript": "i 've been struck over the years by how some people with major challenges seem to draw strength from them and i 've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning and for a long time i thought the meaning was out there some great truth waiting to be found i 've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant we call it finding meaning but we might better call it forging meaning my last book was about how families manage to deal with various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring and one of the mothers i interviewed who had two children with multiple severe disabilities said to me people always give us these little sayings like ' god doesn 't give you any more than you can handle ' but children like ours are not preordained as a gift they 're a gift because that 's what we have chosen choices bobby finkel had a birthday party and invited everyone in our class but me my mother assumed there had been some sort of error and she called mrs finkel who said that bobby didn 't like me and didn 't want me at his party and that day my mom took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae and sometimes he and his cohort would chant that provocation the entire school bus ride and i graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria where i would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so or sat with the boys and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls i survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance what i didn 't know then and do know now is that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning you need to take the traumas and make them part of who you 've come to be evincing a better self in response to things that hurt one of the other mothers i interviewed when i was working on my book had been raped as an adolescent which had thrown away her career plans and damaged all of her emotional relationships and i said to her do you often think about the man who raped you and she said i used to think about him with anger but now only with pity and i said pity and she said yes because he has a beautiful daughter and he doesn 't know that and i do so as it turns out i 'm the lucky one some of our struggles are things we 're born to and some are things that happen to us being a political prisoner being a rape victim being a katrina survivor identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community i am here but i have cancer but rather i have cancer we can 't tell our stories and stories are the foundation that became my mantra forging meaning is about changing yourself building identity is about changing the world all of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily how much to accommodate society by constraining and how much to break the limits of what constitutes a valid life forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right and i was surprised to find them less bitter than i 'd anticipated most of them had knowingly and they walked out with their heads still held high many years later a leading human rights activist who had nearly died in prison and had spent many years in solitary confinement told me she was grateful to her jailers for the time she had had to think for the wisdom she had gained for the chance to hone her meditation skills they were also less thrilled than i 'd expected about the reform process going on in their country but we also have grievance under glamour she said and the fact that there have been these shifts and changes doesn 't erase the continuing problems in our society that we learned to see so well while we were in prison i understood her to be saying saying that concessions confer only a little humanity where full humanity is due that crumbs are not the same as a place at the table which is to say you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell i 've never i 've experienced prejudice and i 've forged meaning which is a move i learned from people who had experienced far worse privation than i 've ever known in my own i enrolled myself in something called sexual surrogacy therapy in which people i was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what i was encouraged to call exercises with women i was encouraged to call surrogates who were not exactly prostitutes but who were also not exactly anything else favorite was a blonde woman from the deep south who eventually admitted to me that she was really a necrophiliac and had taken this job after she got in trouble down at the morgue these experiences allowed me to have some happy physical relationships with women for which i 'm grateful but i was at war with myself but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences we cannot but we can endure great pain if we believe that it 's purposeful but not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning therefore i take pleasure in infirmities st paul wrote in second corinthians i went to moscow to interview artists of the soviet underground i expected their work to be dissident and political but the radicalism in their work actually lay in reinserting humanity into a society that was annihilating humanity itself as in some senses russian society is now doing again one of the artists i met said to me we were in training to be not artists and i was with them during the putsch and they were among the chief organizers of the resistance to that putsch and on the third day of the putsch one of them suggested we walk up to but if you won 't move we 'll have no choice but to run you down the artist i was with said give us just a minute give us just a minute to tell you why we 're here and they went on and on and and then he sat there for a full minute after they were finished and said and we must bow to the will of the people if you 'll clear enough space for us to turn around we 'll go back the way we came forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need to fight for your ultimate freedom and i gradually understood that as the cornerstone it took identity aberrances are a victory identity politics always works on two fronts to give pride to people who have a given condition or characteristic and to cause the outside world to treat such people more gently and more kindly but progress in each sphere reverberates in the other identity politics can be narcissistic people extol a difference only because it 's theirs people narrow the world but properly understood and wisely practiced identity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human identity itself should be not a smug label but a revolution i would have had an easier life if i were straight but i would not be me and we become attached to the heroic i 've sometimes wondered whether i could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay pride 's technicolor fiesta of which this speech is one manifestation and celebration needs to fill and overflow it and even if i repay my private debt of melancholy but not yet a friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself once suggested that we it 's a great idea but its time has not yet come and neutrality which seems to lie halfway between despair and celebration is actually the endgame in twenty nine states in the us i could legally be fired or denied housing for being gay gay in russia the anti propaganda law has led to people being beaten in the streets and lynchings have become common in saudi arabia recently two men who had been caught in carnal acts were sentenced to seven thousand lashes each and are now permanently disabled as a result so who can forge meaning dignity i am lucky to have forged meaning every step forward is so sweet meeting john had been the discovery of great happiness and sometimes i was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain marrying was a way to declare our love as more a presence than an absence marriage soon led us to children and that meant new meanings and new identities and i love them most achingly when they are sad i will have failed as a parent a buddhist scholar i know once explained to me that westerners mistakenly think that nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you and you have only bliss to look forward to but he said that would not be nirvana because your bliss in the present would always be shadowed by the joy from the past nirvana he said is what you arrive at when you have and i sometimes wonder whether i could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children if they 'd come more readily if i 'd been straight in my youth or were young now in either of which cases i tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys because i did not expect those joys to be ordinary to me i know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families and gay families so exhilaratingly new and i found meaning and my family and john said george you can 't make a speech only grandpa and uncle david and i are going to make speeches tonight and george said very loudly and george said i 'm glad we all get cake and daddy if you were little i 'd be your friend and i was finally unconditionally grateful for a life i 'd once have done anything to change and harvey milk said go out and tell someone there 's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity and there are always stories that restore it build identity and then invite the world to share your joy"
