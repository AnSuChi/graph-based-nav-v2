  "transcript": "so when moto opened in two thousand and four people didn 't really know what to expect a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant and maybe it was the name so this is all the ingredients all the flavor of you know a standard maki roll printed onto a little piece of paper hc so our diners started to get bored with this idea so this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood the champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes a little bit of seafood and some crme fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen and it comes off looking like around your plate so yeah we 're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for hc and here 's something we have no reference to eat we fashion that into and we put it in a dollar ninety nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it hc delicious we decided to make so this is a plate of nachos the difference between our nachos and so the chips are candied the ground beef is made from chocolate and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese and after doing all of this dematerialization and reconfiguring of this of we realized that it was pretty cool because as we served it we learned that the dish actually behaves like the real thing where the cheese begins to melt so when you 're looking at this thing in the dining room you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos and it 's just kind of like a so we had been creating all of these dishes out of a kitchen that was more like a mechanic 's than a kitchen and the next logical step for us was to install a state of the art laboratory and that 's what we have here so we put this in the basement and we got really serious about food like serious experimentation br with this new equipment they just kept going further and further out there hc and let 's actually make some cool stuff you see a cow with its tongue hanging out what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious what is that cow eating so the cow basically eats and so what i do is i actually challenge my staff with these crazy wild ideas can we take what the cow eats remove the cow and then make some hamburgers out of that and basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this br but they 're hard to just get automatically there 's a lot of research and trial and error i guess more error that goes into each and every dish so we don 't always get it right and it it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people hc so after about a day of chris and i staring at each other we and not only that but it 's basically removing the cow from the equation so replicating food taking it into that next level is where we 're going and it 's definitely the world 's first bleeding veggie burger and it contains a special property it 's a glycoprotein called miraculin a naturally occurring thing it still freaks me out every time i eat it but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue so that and we can replace it with all natural fresh fruit br so you see us here cutting up some watermelon the idea with this is that we 're going to eliminate wasted energy and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna or any exotic produce or so we have a so the key now is to make it and then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear we really have something that looks tastes and behaves like like the real thing hc but where is this going how can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today as long as they 're non poisonous to the human body go out around chicago blend it cook it and then have everybody flavor trip on it at moto let 's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think so you can imagine because these are ingredients you know plant life that we 're one unfamiliar with and two we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don 't eat them so we really had to think about new creative ways to flavor new ways to cook and to change change texture and that was the main issue with this challenge hc so this is where we step into the future imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them food miles would basically turn into food feet this disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are even if we just swapped out say one of these for flour that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers there 's a bale of hay there and some crab apples and basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue and this is free food"
