  "transcript": "so it all came to life in a dark bar in madrid and like scientists do and he told me that he is interested in how mother rats lick their pups after they were born and i was sitting there and saying this is where my tax dollars are wasted on this kind of soft science and he started telling me some mothers do a lot of that some mothers do very little and most are in between but what 's interesting about it is when he follows these pups when they become adults they are completely different animals the animals that were licked and groomed they have a different way of living than those that were not treated as intensively by their mothers so then i was thinking to myself this magic perhaps the mother had the bad mother gene or is it possible that something else is going on here so what we did is a but mothers that will take care of them high licking mothers and low licking mothers and you can do the opposite with the pups and the remarkable answer was it is i am an a epigeneticist i am interested in how genes are marked by a chemical the womb of our mothers and decide which gene will be expressed in what tissue different genes are expressed in the brain than in the liver and the eye and we thought is it possible that the mother is somehow reprogramming the gene of her offspring through her and we found that there is a cascade of biochemical events by which the licking and grooming of the mother the care of the mother is translated to biochemical signals that go into the nucleus and into the dna and program it differently so now the animal can prepare itself for life is life going to be harsh is there going to be a lot of food are there going to be a lot of cats and snakes around and that will gain me social acceptance and now one can think about how important that process can be for our lives we inherit our dna from our ancestors the dna but it doesn 't tell us if you are going to be born in stockholm where the days are long in the summer and short in the winter or in ecuador where there and that has such an enormous [ effect ] so what we suggest is perhaps what happens early in those signals that come through the mother tell the child what kind of social world you 're going to be living in it and you have to be different is it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light you 'd better develop your brain to binge but sometimes things can go wrong for example if you 're born to a poor family you better eat every piece of food you 're going to encounter the preparation that we had by our mothers is turning out to be maladaptive the same preparation that was supposed to protect us from hunger and famine is going and especially the early life experience can provide us a unifying explanation because ethically we cannot administer child so if a poor child develops a certain property we don 't know whether this is caused by poverty so geneticists will try to tell you that poor people are poor because their genes make them poor epigeneticists will tell you poor people are in a bad environment or an impoverished environment that creates that phenotype so we moved to look the monkeys randomly separated the monkey from the mother and reared her with a nurse so these monkeys didn 't have a mother they had a nurse and other monkeys were reared with their normal natural mothers so we looked at their dna early after birth to see is it possible that the mother is marking is there a signature of the mother in the dna of the offspring we can map the entire genome we can now compare the monkey that had a mother or not and here 's a visual presentation of this what you see is the genes that got more methylated are red the genes that got less methylated are green because not having a mother is not just one thing it affects the whole way it sends signals about the whole way your world is going to look when you become an adult and you can see the two groups of monkeys extremely how early does this develop so in this experiment we took placentas of monkeys that had different social status interesting about social rank monkey number one is the boss and what 's interesting is that the monkey number one is much healthier than monkey number one will will not eat as much monkey number four will eat [ a lot ] and what you see here in this methylation mapping a dramatic separation at birth so we are and that social information is not bad or good it just prepares us for life because we have to we can 't do experiments we but god does experiments with humans and it 's called natural disasters one of it 's the ice storm of one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and my colleague suzanne king followed the children of these mothers for fifteen years and what happened was that as the stress increased and here we had objective measures of stress how long were you without power where did you spend your time was it in your mother in law 's apartment or in some so all of these added up to a social they develop more metabolic diseases and they develop more autoimmune diseases so if we can program genes if we are not just the slaves of the history of our genes that they could be programmed can we deprogram them because epigenetic causes can cause diseases like cancer metabolic disease let 's talk about cocaine addiction cocaine addiction is a terrible situation we asked the question can we reprogram the addicted brain to make that animal we used a cocaine addiction model that recapitulates what happens in humans in humans you 're in high school months pass by something reminds you of what happened the first time a pusher and you become addicted and your life has changed no cocaine then he reminds them of the party when they saw the cocaine the first time by cue the colors of the cage when they saw cocaine we first determined that the difference between these their genome is ready so we treated these animals with drugs that either increase dna methylation which was the epigenetic marker to look at or decrease epigenetic we have reprogrammed them and a fundamental difference between an epigenetic drug and any other drug and once they 're gone they will not come back unless you have the same experience they were still not addicted by a single epigenetic treatment so it 's not just a script dna is a dynamic movie our experiences are being written into this movie which is interactive you 're like watching a movie of your life with the dna with your remote control you can remove an actor and add an actor and so you have and this has a tremendous optimistic message for the ability to now encounter some of the deadly diseases like cancer reverse the movie by removing an actor and setting up so what i told you today is our dna is really combined of two components two layers of information it is fixed the other layer of information is the epigenetic layer which is open and dynamic and sets up a narrative that is to control to a large extent our destiny to help the destiny of our children and to hopefully conquer conquer disease and serious health challenges that have plagued humankind so even though we are determined by our genes thank you"
