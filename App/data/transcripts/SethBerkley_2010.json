  "transcript": "you worry about what is going to kill you heart disease cancer a car accident most of us worry about things we can 't control like but what really threatens humanity he called these massively fatal meaning that they could kill up to one hundred million people in the next fifty but it can be a death thousand people in the united states die of seasonal flu in the developing world the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher you the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic and eighteen a new virus appeared that killed some fifty to one hundred million people it spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms but this threat could reappear at any time the good news is that we 're at a moment in the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth and if we get these to more so i 'm here to trumpet vaccines for you but first i have to explain why they 're important because vaccines the power of them is really like a whisper when they work they can make history but after a while you can barely we don 't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines now why is that well until recently we haven 't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked you took a pathogen you modified it you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened so let 's explore how vaccines work they basically of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed what happens is you have forces in your body pre trained to recognize and defeat specific foes so that 's really how vaccines work now let 's take a look at a video that we 're debuting at ted for the first time on how an effective hiv vaccine might work a vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader after hiv penetrates the body 's capture the virus and display pieces of it front line troops these memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto hiv to prevent it from infecting cells while squadrons of killer t cells seek out and destroy cells that are already hiv infected without a vaccine these responses would have taken more than a week by that time the battle against hiv would already have been lost seth berkley really cool video isn 't it in action are the ones that make most vaccines work so the real so let 's take a look at the flu virus in this rendering of the flu virus these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you and also what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize and the antibodies don 't know what they 're looking at anymore it 's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall even worse the most common influenza influenza a also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans and they can recombine in addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of now luckily that particular virus although very scary at the time did not transmit from person to person very easily this year 's avian swine mixture that arose in mexico it was easily transmitted but and so in a sense our luck is holding out but you know another wild bird could fly over at anytime the virus that causes aids is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted it mutates furiously here 's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to hiv a much wilder target in the video a moment ago you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells now that in a recently infected person finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder we 've developed more drugs to treat hiv than all other viruses put together these drugs aren 't cures but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of hiv at least for those who can access them large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids vaccine but today evidence tells us otherwise we saw an aids but in the past few months researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an hiv infected individual we saw earlier that hiv is highly variable that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus if you take these and you put them in in addition these researchers found a new site on hiv where the antibodies can grab onto and what 's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates it 's like as many times as the virus changes so what we 've got is a situation the thai results tell us we can make an aids vaccine and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that this strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before so think of it this way present that through a vaccine three dimensional structures are much harder to work on and if you guys have ideas to help us solve this we 'd love to hear about it the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases so for instance a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus they 're currently making a cocktail an antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe overwhelming cases of flu what they can do is use these tools of retro vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine now notice these other smaller protuberances these are largely hidden from the immune system now it turns out that these spots also don 't change much when the virus mutates so if this works in humans what we 're talking about is a universal flu vaccine one that doesn 't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death we really could think of flu bad cold of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods the u s government promised one hundred and fifty million doses of vaccine by october 15th for the flu peak well we first figured out how to make flu vaccines how to it was a slow cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs viruses only grow in living things and so it turned out that for flu chicken eggs worked really well we get our flu vaccines from chicken eggs hundreds of millions of chicken eggs the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow this year 's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early you could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines so but this assumes that our factories are humming and the process still takes more than half a year so are we better prepared than we were with the new technologies emerging now i hope we can say definitively yes imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we 're currently spending now in the united states with a range of new technologies we could here 's an example a company i 'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the h spike of flu that sparks the immune system which creates a vigorous immune response they 've created a very powerful flu fighter e coli now as you know bacteria reproduce quickly it 's like making yogurt and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods so here 's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies and aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings for example the e coli method i just talked about sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they 're leapfrogging the west india mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use because these technologies are so efficient and relatively billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them now think of where this leads us new infectious diseases appear or reappear some day perhaps soon we 'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us luckily this year 's flu was relatively so if we have the political and financial foresight and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives no longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year no longer does aids need to kill two million a year and you must dream about this what is the kind of time scale on let 's start with hiv for a game changing vaccine that 's actually out there and usable sb the game change can come at any time because the problem we have now is we 've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans we just need a better one and with these types of antibodies we know humans can make them so if we can figure out how to do that then we have the and what 's interesting is there already is some evidence that we 're beginning to crack that problem so the challenge is full speed ahead ca in your gut do you think it 's probably going to be at least another five years sb you know everybody says it 's ten years but it 's been ten years every ten years so i hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends ca and that 's the same with universal flu vaccine the same kind of thing sb i think flu is different i think what happened with flu is we 've got a the problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that 's what we were comfortable with you also can use adjuvants which are chemicals you mix that 's what europe is doing so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available but going back to what michael specter said the anti vaccine crowd didn 't really want that to happen ca and malaria 's even there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now it probably isn 't the perfect vaccine but it 's moving along ca seth most of us do work you 've been slaving away at this for more than a decade"
