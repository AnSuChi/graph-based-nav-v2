  "transcript": "the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple we don 't want iran to get the bomb the gray boxes that you see now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves we can actually cause a lot of problems with but if we manage to a good windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure damages the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear program is delayed mission accomplished that 's easy huh it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was the only thing that so that got our attention and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out and then some very funny things happened stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn 't like our cheese sniffed but didn 't want to eat didn didn 't make sense to me and after we experimented with different flavors of cheese i realized well this is a directed attack it 's completely directed the dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found and even if the actual program code that so we better find out what the target is soon so we extracted and decompiled the attack code and we discovered that it 's structured in two digital bombs a smaller one and a bigger one and we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information they knew all the bits and bites that and if you have heard that the dropper of stuxnet is complex the payload is rocket science it 's way above everything that we have ever seen before looks pretty much like old style assembly so so we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove in order to get target theories we remember that it 's definitely hardcore sabotage it must be a high value target and it is most likely located in iran because that 's where most of the infections had been reported now you don 't find several thousand targets in that area it basically boils down to the bushehr nuclear power plant and to the natanz fuel enrichment plant so i told my assistant get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base and i phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data so we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control the rotor is that moving part within and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode the goal of the attack was really to to do it slowly and creepy obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy that they would not be able to figure this out quickly the big digital warhead we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures so for really stands out in that code you can 't overlook it they are structured in what is called a cascade so that made sense that was a match and it even got better these centrifuges in iran and guess what we found in the attack code an almost identical structure so again that was a real good match and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at now don 't get me wrong here it didn 't go like this these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor and we often but from different angles the small warhead is taking so in all we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is it is natanz and it is only natanz so we don 't have to worry that other targets might be hit by by stuxnet here 's some very cool stuff that we saw really knocked my socks off now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors so for example from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and it provides legitimate program code which is still running during the attack with fake input data so it 's just like from the hollywood movies where during the heist the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video that 's cool idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system we need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough so for example in a power plant when your big steam turbine gets too over speed you must open relief valves within a millisecond so this is where we need digital safety systems and when they are compromised then real bad things can happen your plant can blow up and neither your operators nor nor your safety system will notice it it doesn 't have anything to do in specifics with centrifuges with and if you do that what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction that 's the consequence that we have to face face target rich environments we have to face the quite widely reported that people assume that mossad is is the main entity behind this is that your opinion ralph langner okay you really want to hear that is involved but so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower there is only one and that 's the united states because otherwise our problems would even be bigger ca thank you for scaring the living daylights out"
