  "transcript": "crew and i were called to a little town in colorado called craig it 's only a couple dozen square miles it 's in the rockies and the job in question was sheep rancher and i work with the people who do the jobs in question and my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it 's like to be these people for one day in their life the job in question herding sheep great we go to craig and and i realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute i never do any research at all but this is a touchy subject and i work for the discovery channel and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals so i call the humane society and i say look i 'm going to be castrating some lambs can you tell me the deal and they 're like like this only a little smaller this one was actually around the playing cards i got yesterday but it had a certain familiarity to it and i said well blood flow is slowly retarded a week later the parts in question fall off great got it ok that 's basically how you do it so the next day i go out and i 'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built and we go about the business of melanie is the wife of albert albert is the shepherd in question melanie picks up the lamb likewise on the left she opens it up alright great albert goes in you do that albert reaches in his pocket to pull out you know this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife that 's not rubber at all you know and he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the rockies it was very it was impressive in the space of about two seconds albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail right next to the butt of the lamb and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that i was a second later with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp and he pulled it toward him like so and he took the knife ok obscuring my but what i hear is a slurping sound and a noise that sounds like velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and i am not even kidding can we roll the video no i 'm kidding we don 't i do something now i 've never ever done on a dirty jobs shoot ever i say time out stop you guys know the show we use take we don 't do take two there 's no writing there 's no scripting there 's no nonsense we don 't fool around we don 't rehearse we shoot what we get i said stop this is nuts i mean this is crazy we can 't do this and albert 's like what and i 'm like i don 't know what just happened but there are testicles in this bucket and that 's not how we do it he said well that 's how we do it i said why would you do it this way and before i even let him explain i said i want to do it the right way with the rubber bands and he says like the humane society i said yes like the humane society let 's do something that doesn 't make the lamb squeal and bleed we 're on in five continents dude we 're on twice a day on the discovery we can 't do this he says melanie picks up another lamb puts it on the band goes on the tail band goes on the scrotum lamb goes on the ground lamb takes two steps falls down i 'm like this is not a it 's quivering and it lies down and it 's in obvious distress and i 'm looking at the lamb and i say them to fall off a week meanwhile the lamb that he had just done his little procedure on is you know and i was just so blown away at how completely wrong i was and i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time and i was especially reminded of what a ridiculously short straw i had that day because now i had to do what albert had just done and there are like one hundred of these lambs in the pen and suddenly this whole thing 's starting to feel like a german porno and i 'm like melanie picks up the lamb puts it on the post opens it up albert hands me the i go in i grab the scrotum tip comes off albert instructs push it way up there i do push it further i do the testicles emerge they look like thumbs coming right at you i mean it 's just it 's one of those moments where the brain goes you know aristotle says a tragedy is that is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity and i 'm like what is this jacked up metaphor i don 't like what i 'm thinking right now and i can 't get this thought out of my head and i can 't get that vision out of my sight so i did what and i yanked my head back and i 'm standing there with two testicles on my chin i 'm still in in aristotle and i 'm thinking out of nowhere two terms come crashing into my head that i hadn 't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there and they are it 's what our network does it 's what dirty jobs is and i 'm up to my neck in every single day great the other word peripeteia that 's peripety or peripeteia and this metaphor in my head i 've got anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin laughter i 've got to tell you it 's such a it that 's weird these been having them over two hundred dirty jobs i have them all the time but that one looking at the happy lamb that looking at that poor other little thing that i 'd done it if i 'm wrong about that and if i 'm wrong so often in a literal way what other peripatetic misconceptions might i be able to comment upon because look i 'm not a social anthropologist but i have a friend who is and i i talk to him laughter and he says hey mike look i don 't you 've worked in mining you 've worked in fishing you 've worked in steel you 've worked dribbling down her chin with the steel workers i mean that 's in my head testicles are on my chin thoughts are bouncing around and after that shoot dirty jobs really didn 't change in terms of what the show is and now when i talk about the show i no longer just tell the story you heard and one hundred and ninety like it but i also start to talk about some of the other things i got wrong and they 're not people with dirty jobs are happier than you think the happiest people i know picker uppers whistle while they work i swear to god i did it with them so i started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows follow your passion we 've been talking about for the last thirty six hours follow your passion what could possibly be wrong with that it 's probably the worst advice i ever got i mean that 's all i heard growing up i didn 't know what to do with my life but i was told if you follow your passion it 's going to work out i can give you thirty examples right now bob combs the pig farmer in las vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them to his swine why because there 's so much protein in the stuff we don 't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed he 's making a great living you ask him did you follow your passion here and he 'd laugh at you he stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way and i hear that story over and over matt freund a dairy farmer in new canaan connecticut who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk if he could use it to make these biodegradable the guy 's so i started to look at passion i started to look at that 's a huge distinction i that stuff it 's suddenly all been turned on its head safety safety first is going back to osha and peta and the humane society what if osha got it wrong i mean this is heresy what i 'm about to say but what if what if it 's really safety third right no i i value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that i 'm working with but the ones who really get it done they 're not out there talking about safety first they know that other things come first the business of doing the work comes first the business of getting it done and i 'll never forget up in the bering sea i was on a crab boat with the deadliest catch which i also work on in the first season we were about one hundred miles off the coast of russia big waves green water coming over the wheelhouse right which is like looking down at the top of your shoe you know and it 's doing this in the ocean unspeakably dangerous i scamper down i go into the wheelhouse and i say and he points out there but he looked at me and said son he 's my age by the way he calls me son i love that the captain of a crab boat my responsibility is not to get you home alive my responsibility is to get you home rich you want to get home alive that 's on you and for the rest of that day safety first i mean i was like so the idea that we create this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody else 's responsibility as though it 's our own and vice versa anyhow a whole lot of but what it all comes down to is this we 've declared war it 's a cold war really we didn we didn 't set out to do it and we didn 't twist our mustache in some machiavellian way but we 've done it and we 've waged this war on at least four fronts certainly in hollywood the way we portray working people on tv it 's laughable if there 's a plumber he 's three hundred pounds and he 's got a giant butt crack admit it you see him all the time that 's what plumbers look like right we turn them into heroes that 's what tv does we try hard on dirty jobs not to do that which is why i do the work and i don 't cheat but we 've waged this war on madison avenue so many of the commercials that come out there in the way of a message what 's really being said your life would be better if you could work a little less didn 't have to work so hard got home a little earlier could retire a little faster punch out a little sooner it 's all in there over and over again and again washington i can 't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect i mean how many people have an iphone on them right we 're plugged in we 're connected i would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution good grief not to this crowd laughter but i would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time and nobody celebrates imitation the way dirty jobs guys know it has to be done your iphone without those people making the same interface circuitry the same board over and over all of that that 's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes our tools today don 't look like shovels and picks they look like the stuff we walk around with and so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization and i realized probably too late in this game i hope not because i don 't know if i can do two hundred more of these things but we 're going to do as many as we can and to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with is that fact that i got it wrong about a lot of things not just the we 're thinking by we i mean me that the thing to do is to talk about a pr campaign for work i 'm talking about grandfather stuff the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we 've kind of lost a little the infrastructure is the first one fewer steam fitters the infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys according to the american society of civil engineers that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure which is currently rated at a d minus if i were running for anything and i 'm not i would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create aren but i also know that clean and dirty aren 't opposites they 're two sides of the same coin just like innovation and imitation like risk and and anagnorisis and like my time that 's gone it 's been great talking to you and get back to work"
