  "transcript": "twenty years ago a biologist named anthony james got obsessed with the idea of making mosquitos that didn 't transmit malaria pretty much a complete failure for one thing it turned out to be really hard to make a malaria resistant mosquito but that just created another problem now that you 've got a malaria resistant mosquito how do you get it to replace all the malaria carrying mosquitos but plan a was basically to breed up a bunch of the new genetically engineered mosquitos release them into the wild and hope that they pass on their genes so in a village with ten thousand mosquitos you release an extra one hundred thousand as you might guess this was not a very popular strategy with the villagers anthony james got an email from a biologist named ethan bier but that it would spread incredibly quickly finally they set it up so that any mosquitos that had inherited the anti malaria gene wouldn 't have the usual white that was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which and let them breed those had produced three thousand eight hundred grandchildren this is the surprising part that 's because getting only red eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the so if our original mosquito was aa and our new mosquito is ab where b is the anti malarial gene the babies should come out in four permutations they all came out that shouldn 't even be possible so what happened and there 's an rna molecule that the scissors to any point on the genome you want the result is basically a word processor for genes you can take an entire gene out put one in or even edit just a single letter within a gene the first was that it was hard to engineer a mosquito to be malaria resistant that 's basically gone now thanks to crispr but the other problem was logistical how do you get your trait to spread this is where it gets clever a couple years ago a biologist at harvard named kevin in other words what if crispr also copied and pasted this crispr gene drive that esvelt created not only guarantees that a trait will get passed on it will automatically copy and paste your new gene into both chromosomes of every single individual it 's like a global search and so what does this mean for one thing it means we have a very powerful but also somewhat alarming new tool up until now the fact that gene drives didn 't work very well was actually kind of a relief normally when we mess around with an organism 's genes we make that thing less evolutionarily fit natural selection just takes care of them assuming that your trait does not have a big evolutionary handicap like a mosquito that can 't fly gene drive will spread the change relentlessly until it is in every single individual in the population esvelt think that we can the good news is that this opens the door to some remarkable things researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year in a year that number could be almost zero and it gets better say you want to get rid of get asian carp out of the great lakes all you have to do is release a gene drive that makes the fish produce only male offspring in a few generations there 'll be no females left no more carp in theory this means we could restore hundreds of native species that have been pushed to the brink that 's the good news this is the bad news gene drives are so effective that even an accidental release could change an entire they 'd just die off there 'd be nothing for them to mate with but it 's also true that if a dozen asian carp with the all male gene drive accidentally got carried and that 's fish things like mosquitos and fruit flies the other piece of bad news is that a gene drive might not stay confined to what we call the target species that 's because of gene flow which is a fancy way of saying that neighboring species sometimes interbreed in fact there 's a decent chance that we 'll see a wave of very weird fruit flies in the near future the last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this to genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive is something that basically any lab in the world can do an undergraduate can do it a talented high schooler with some equipment can do it partly because they believe that scientists will be very cautious and responsible about using them but gene drives also have some actual limitations so for one thing they work only in sexually reproducing species be used to engineer viruses or bacteria in elephants or people it would take centuries for a trait to spread widely enough to matter also even with crispr it 's not that easy to engineer a truly devastating trait say you wanted to make a fruit fly that feeds on ordinary fruit instead of rotting fruit with the aim of sabotaging american agriculture then you 'd have to alter those genes to change the fly 's behavior to whatever you 'd want it to be which is an even longer and more complicated project so if you 're a terrorist and have to choose between starting a grueling basic research program that will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out or just blowing stuff up you 'll probably choose the later this is especially true because at least in theory it should be pretty easy to build what 's called a reversal drive so if you don 't like the effects of a change you can just release a second drive that will cancel it out so where does this leave us we now have the ability to change entire species at will should we are we gods now i 'm not sure i 'd say that but i would say this first some very smart people are even now debating how to regulate gene drives that 's great and given the nature of gene drives that conversation has to be global what if kenya wants to use a drive but tanzania doesn 't who decides whether to release a gene drive that can fly fly i don 't have the answer to that question all we can do going forward i think is talk honestly about the risks and benefits by that i mean not just the choice to use a gene drive but also the choice not to use one humans have a tendency to assume that the safest option is to preserve the but that 's not always the case but malaria exists now and kills one thousand people a day remember that but sometimes not acting is worse"
