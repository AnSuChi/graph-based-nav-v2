  "transcript": "and she 'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition now at the time i hadn 't met stacey and but it was only later that i found out she 'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen i took the picture of her parents but i was actually more excited about photographing stacey the picture i made that day ended up becoming one of my not long after she left her job to study photography in maine and while she was there she ended up meeting the director of photography at the new york times magazine and was actually offered a job stacey baker and we 've become friends a few months i started talking to alec about a fascination of mine i then asked alec if he be interested in doing a photography project exploring this question as and i was interested in the question but i was actually much more interested in stacey 's motivation for asking it i thought it 'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone so my idea was to have stacey here go speed dating in las vegas on valentine 's day i had nineteen dates participants were given a list of ice breaker questions to get the ball rolling things like if you could be any kind of animal what would you be that sort of thing and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a capricorn alec and i saw him at the end of the evening and he said he 'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves we talked about running he does triathlons i run he said you 're in an elevator running late for a meeting someone makes a dash for the elevator do you hold it open for them and i said i would not and we complimented each other 's teeth and so i asked him how i wasn 't really sure that that was flossing more but i don 't think i said that out loud and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing the first thing spencer notices about a woman is her complexion he feels a lot of women wear too craig told me he didn 't think i was willing to be vulnerable he was also frustrated when i couldn 't remember my most embarrassing moment he thought i was lying but i wasn 't i didn 't think he liked me at all but at the end of the night he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates william was really difficult to talk to i think he was drunk he used to be on the young and the restless i didn 't actually go on a date with i didn 't feel a particular connection with any of the men that i went on dates with and i didn 't feel like they felt the most beautiful thing to me as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability the physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior at this date a thon event i saw so many examples of that but as i i realized how different photographic love is from stacey and i went to sun city summerlin which is the largest retirement community in las vegas our contact there was george who runs the community 's photography club he arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio so we asked if she had an old wedding picture she met her husband when she was a 15 year old waitress at a small barbecue place in michigan he was thirty she 'd lied about her age dean had been named photographer of the year in las vegas two years in a row and this caught alec 's attention as did the fact that he met his wife judy at the same age when alec met rachel dean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women but he 's never questioned his decision to marry judy as george met josephine at a parish dance he was eighteen she was fifteen like a lot of the couples george said said something that really stuck with me he said when you get that feeling you just go with it bob and trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school they said they weren 't particularly attracted to each other when the first met nevertheless they were married and his wife mary when they started dating he owed the irs nine thousand george was actually an alcoholic when they married and mary knew it but they escaped and a swat team was was called to the house amazingly mary took him back and eventually things got better george has been involved in alcoholics anonymous and hasn 't had a drink in thirty six years at the end of the day after we left sun city i told alec that i didn 't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting what was more interesting was how they managed to stay together as but that was true of the singles too the world is hard and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people and the couples were holding onto each other after all these decades now by the time we met joe and roseanne we 'd gotten in the habit they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets what 's more beautiful i thought to myself this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two thank you"
