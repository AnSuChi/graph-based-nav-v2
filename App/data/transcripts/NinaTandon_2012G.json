  "transcript": "a video of some of the models i work with they 're all the perfect size and they don 't have an ounce of fat and they 're scientific models but what i 'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models let 's think about the drug screening process for a moment you go from drug formulation lab testing animal testing and then clinical trials which you might call human testing before the drugs get to market it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people despite our incredible similarities to one another actually those tiny differences between you and i have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us so what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats let 's see how we can do it with tissue engineering one of the key technologies that 's really important is what 's called induced pluripotent stem cells they were developed in japan pretty recently okay induced pluripotent stem cells they 're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy into an embryonic state so we can make a model of your heart your brain and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery and this is a schematic of a bioreactor we 're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular scalable way going forward imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue we can actually use models of those diseases in the lab here 's an example from kevin eggan 's lab at harvard he generated neurons from these induced pluripotent stem cells from patients who have lou gehrig 's disease and he differentiated them into neurons and what 's amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease so with disease models like these we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before and maybe discover drugs even faster so some people think that these models sound well and are these really as good as the rat don 't you miss all that with these tissue engineered models this is another trend in the field complete with multiple and so but that 's not even all of it because once a drug is approved tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments this is an example wouldn 't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you 're going to take are going to work on your cancer and some of our colleagues at tufts are mixing models like these with tissue engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next and you can imagine those kinds of multi tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies"
