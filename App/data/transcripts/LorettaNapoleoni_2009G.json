  "transcript": "show you how terrorism fifteen years ago i received a phone call from a friend at the time he was looking after the rights of political now as many of you may remember the red brigades was marxist organization which was very active in italy from the 1960s until the as part of their strategy the red brigades never spoke with anybody not even with their lawyers waving occasionally at family and friends and tell their story and i was one of those people when i asked my friend why the red brigades want to talk to me he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported she was my childhood friend i read it in the newspaper at the time of the phone call i just had a baby completed a management buyout to the company i was working but this is exactly what i did and why the center committee of the red brigades had judged me and too opinionated to become a good terrorist because she believed that the only way to unblock what at the time was known as a blocked democracy italy a country run by the same party for thirty five years at the same time i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics now contrary to what many people believe now you know if you live underground it 's really hard to produce this amount of money brigades and then later on other arms organizations including members of the which generally is never more than five to seven people all the others do day in and day out is search for money he loved sailing he was a really keen sailor and he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the red brigades and then carry them all the way to sardinia where the other arms organization from europe would go and take their share of the arms for that service the red brigades were actually paid a fee which went to fund their organization but it was only when the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro italian i finally realized that terrorism is actually business and i had the distinct feeling that this guy thought in the in the end i took a decision that in retrospect and what i discovered is this parallel reality another international economic system which runs parallel to our own which has been created by arms organizations since the end of world war ii and what is even more shocking is that this system has followed step by step the state sponsor of fully funding arms organizations a mix of legal and illegal activities is used so the link between crime and terror is established very early on and here is the best example the contras in nicaragua so they gain independence from the sponsor so arafat which control the private transportation system in northern ireland every single time but the great change came of course with globalization and deregulation this is when arms organization were able to link up also financially with each other but above all they started to do serious business with the this is an organization that can raise money across border but also that is able to carry out attacks now deregulation also brought back so what is rogue economics it is at this times in which politics it has happened before in history it has happened with the now i calculated and illegal economy this is about soon will be more considering where this country is going until 9 11 the bulk of all this money flew into the u s economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in u s dollars now when i went to look at the figures of the u s money supply money supply is the amount of dollars which of course reflects the growth i noted that since the late a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the united states never to come back these were these were money taken out to fund the growth you see what is the the united states actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world what does it mean this privilege is called seigniorage no other country can do all the other countries for example the united kingdom can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders and our economy the u s this is how close we are with this world now this situation changed now many of you know that the patriot act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of americans in order to protect but there is a section of the patriot act which refers specifically to finance and it is in fact legislation what the patriot act did was to prohibit authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world all the bankers said to their clients get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else now the euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business nobody wants the u s monetary authority to check their relationship to monitor their relationship with their clientele in the world of crime and terror people simply moved their money laundering activities away from the united states into europe why did this happen this happened because the patriot act was a unilateral legislation it was introduced only in the united states and it was introduced only for the u s dollars so within six months europe became the and our own life"
