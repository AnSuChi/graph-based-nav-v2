  "transcript": "tell you about a project being carried out by scientists all over the world to paint a neural portrait of the human mind and the central idea of this work is that the human mind and but a collection of highly specialized components each solving a different specific problem and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers you walk into your child 's day care center the children 's faces look weirdly similar and you can 't figure out which child is yours and everything looks normal except the children 's faces and it 's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter this sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people it and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain everything else is just fine prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific mental deficits that can happen after brain damage especially mri so mri enables you to see internal anatomy at high resolution so i 'm going to show you in a second a set of mri cross sectional images through a familiar object and we 're going to fly through them and you 're going to try to figure out what the object is here we go it 's starting from the bottom and going through the top i love that okay here 's another one it 's a brain of course in fact it 's my brain we 're going through slices through my head like that that 's my nose over on the right and now we 're going over here so this picture 's nice if i do say so myself the really cool advance with functional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just anatomy but so functional mri picks up on that blood flow increase producing a higher so to give you a concrete feel for how a functional mri experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can 't we wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia that i described a moment ago but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain in a normal person so we set out to look for it i lay on my back i held my head as still as i could while staring at pictures of faces like these and objects like these i can tell you that one of the skills that 's really important for mri research is bladder control i did a quick analysis of the data looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when i was looking at faces than when i was looking at objects it 's about the size of an olive and it 's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there and what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher mri response so that 's pretty cool but how do we know this isn 't a fluke and then i did it again and i did it again and again and again so the next question was what does this thing really do is it really specialized just for face recognition maybe it responds to anything human or anything alive or anything round the only way to be really sure that that region is specialized for face recognition is to rule out all of those hypotheses and it responds much less strongly to any image you show that isn 't a face like some of these so have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything all you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts and normally we don 't get to do that but an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain it 's going to start with a control condition that will say sham nearly invisibly in red in the lower left when no current is delivered and you 'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first so let 's watch look at my face this experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only so to do this i 've spent a lot of time in the scanner over the last month so let 's get started so we 're oriented like that you 're looking at my head this way imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that okay next let 's find that face area i 've been talking about that responds to images like these to see that let 's turn the brain around and look on the inside surface on the bottom and there it is that 's my face area and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places and near that is a region that responds when you look at images of bodies and body parts like these and that region is shown in lime now all these regions i 've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception do we also have specialized brain regions so if we turn the brain around a little bit and this region responds strongly when you hear sounds with pitch like these like these pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech okay albeit sometimes different really fancy complicated mental processes yes we do so here in pink are my language regions but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively but not when you do other complex mental things the most amazing region that 's been found yet is this one right here so that may seem crazy but actually we humans do this all the time you uncharted territory in the brain and what 's up with that and we 're running a i don 't think we have specializations in the brain for every important mental function even mental functions that may be critical for survival in fact a few years ago there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he 'd found a brain region and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this and further he found a similar response in more or less the same location in ten out of twelve subjects and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on oprah but then he devised the critical test he showed subjects but that weren 't food like these so much for oprah but then the question of course process all this other stuff that we don 't have specialized brain regions for well i think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that i 've been describing we also have a lot of very general purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along in fact we 've shown recently that so each of the brain regions that i 've described to you today although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size what 's important to me about this work but the simple fact that we have selective specific components of mind and brain in the first place i mean it could have been otherwise the brain could have been a single general purpose processor more like a kitchen knife than a swiss army knife instead what brain imaging has delivered so we have this picture of very general purpose machinery in our heads in addition to this surprising array of very specialized components it the most fundamental questions remain unanswered why do we need three face areas and three place areas and what 's the division of labor between them and with this method shown here you can trace the connections of individual neurons both over development in childhood and they 're also scanning human infants many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like alzheimer 's and autism that 's a hugely important goal and i 'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that 's worth doing the effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease what could be more thrilling than to understand the fundamental mechanisms that underlie human experience to understand in essence who we are this is i think the greatest scientific quest of all time"
