  "transcript": "never forget that day back in the spring of two thousand and six i got paged by the e r around two in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as i pulled the curtain back to see her the question that was being asked of me was a different one which was did she also need an amputation i 'd love so desperately to believe that that i treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion i 'd shown the newlywed who came to the e r three nights earlier with lower back pain in her case i knew there was nothing i could do that actually going to save her life the cancer was too advanced but i was committed to making sure that i brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee i see i passed no judgment on her because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself so why was it that just a few nights later as i stood in that same i mean how hard can it be i ironically at that time in my life i was also doing cancer research immune based therapies for melanoma to be specific and in that world i was actually taught to question i never once questioned the conventional wisdom i actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science but this time i was the patient i 'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome some of you may have heard of this i had become you can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat whether we burn it or store it this now failure to produce enough insulin once you 're on your way to getting diabetes which is what happens when your pancreas can 't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease cancer and amputations just like that woman a few years earlier adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking i did this and lost forty pounds weirdly while exercising less i but most how did this happen to me if i was supposedly doing everything right i became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship you treat the obesity but what if we have it backwards what if obesity isn 't the cause of insulin resistance at all in fact what if it 's a symptom of a much deeper problem the tip of a proverbial iceberg but hear me out what if obesity is a coping mechanism i 'm not suggesting that obesity is benign but what i am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately when we become insulin resistant the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state so now when insulin says to i 'd actually rather store this energy and because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells it 's probably the safest place to store it so for many of us about seventy five million americans the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat not the reverse getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat but the implication could be profound consider the following analogy think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table but we all know the bruise per se is not the problem in fact it 's the opposite it 's a healthy response to the trauma all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris imagine we thought bruises were the painkillers you name it all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables how much better would we be if we treated the cause telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room rather than the effect getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world getting it wrong and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins cause so what i 'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance maybe we should be asking ourselves is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity at least in most people the one we ought to be worried about let 's look at some suggestive facts we know that thirty million obese americans in the united states don 't have insulin and by the way they don 't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people conversely we know that six million lean people in the united states are and by the way they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases i mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts now i don 't know why but it might be because and you can be lean and have it this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what 's going on even worse what if blaming the obese means we 're blaming the victims what if some of our fundamental ideas about let alone the luxury of certainty now my hypothesis because everybody always asks me is this if you ask yourself what 's a cell blood sugar now we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run and there 's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly i 'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains sugars and starches that 's driving this epidemic and not necessarily through just overeating and and which admittedly suggests i have a bias based on my personal experience but step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested i devote all of my time to working on this problem i 've decided that what i can 't and won 't do anymore i 've been humbled enough by all i don 't know and the best part is just like abraham lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals we 've done the same thing we 've recruited a team of scientific rivals the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what 's at the heart of this epidemic some think it 's but this team of highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer and two if we 're willing to be wrong if we 're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom i know it 's tempting to want an answer right now some form of action or policy some dietary prescription eat this not that but if we want to get it right we 're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism hormones and enzymes and through what nuanced based on these insights can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that 's safe and practical to implement once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception just because you know what to do doesn 't mean you 're always going to do it sometimes we have to put cues around but this much seems clear to me at least we can 't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like i did but they have to know what i dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds because as medical professionals we 've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals open minds the courage to throw out yesterday 's ideas when they don 't appear to be working staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science if obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness sometimes i think back to that i wish i could speak with that woman again i 'd like to tell her how sorry i am i 'd a doctor i delivered the best clinical care i could but as a as a i let you down you needed my empathy you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn 't let the system down maybe the system if you 're watching this now i hope you can forgive me"
