  "transcript": "and the answer i like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war what i 've spent fifteen years doing in this business and it 's taken me almost fourteen to figure it out is i think about the future of wars in the context of everything else so i tend to specialize on the scene between war the material was generated in two years of work i did for the secretary of defense thinking about a new national grand strategy for the united states here 's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the pentagon the theory of asymmetrical strategies why do we call it that because it 's got all those a 's lined up i guess which is why people don 't try to do that any more he 's now a one star general that 's how distant we are so that overmatched capability creates problems catastrophic successes the white house calls them because it is an amazing capability the question is what 's the good you can do with it ok the theory of area denial asymmetrical strategies gobbledygook that we sell to congress because if we just told them we can kick anybody 's asses they wouldn buy us all the stuff we want so we say asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over and they say will you build it in my district here 's my parody and it ain 't much of one 's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space i don 't know the million man swim the united states has to access that battle space instantaneously they throw up area denial asymmetrical strategies a banana peel on the tarmac trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our achilles ' heels we field the first half team that 's the problem we can run the score up against anybody and then get our asses kicked in the second half what they call fourth generation warfare here 's the way i like to describe it instead there is no battle we did it with one hundred and fifty combat casualties in six weeks we did it so fast we weren 't prepared for their collapse so there 's no trouble accessing battle spaces what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow and creating the peace space that allows us to move on the defense department over here beats the hell out of you the state department over here says come on boy i know you can make it and that poor country runs off that ledge does that cartoon thing and then drops this is not about overwhelming because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting this is not about projecting power but about staying power which is about legitimacy with the locals we asked the indians for seventeen thousand peace keepers i know their senior leadership they wanted to give it to us but we don 't think you can pull it off we 're not going to give you our seventeen thousand peace keepers for fodder we asked it 's your oil not ours and the chinese but it 's not a perfect world and your administration isn 't getting us any closer we face different opponents across these three it 's just too damn hard we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war frankly we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it we have a brilliant secretary of war we don 't have because if we did that guy would be in front of the senate still testifying over abu ghraib the problem is he doesn 't exist there is no secretary of everything else i think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war i call that the leviathan what we need to build is a force for the everything else i call them the system administrators what i think this really represents is lack of an a to z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states we have one for processing economically bankrupt states it 's the imf sovereign bankruptcy plan argentina just went through it broke a lot of rules they got out on the far end we said we don 't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that frankly everybody wants gone like saddam like mugabe like kim jong il people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions like the two hundred and fifty thousand dead so far in sudan what would an a to z system look like what i call front half and back half and let 's call this red line i don 't know mission accomplished what can they they can put it in an envelope and mail it to you and then say in no uncertain terms please cut that out answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in africa and you better have an answer we don 't have anything to translate that will into action what we do have is the u s enabled leviathan force that says you want me to take that guy down i 'll take that guy down i 'll do it on tuesday it will cost you twenty billion dollars but here 's the deal as soon as i can 't find anybody else to air out i leave the scene immediately that 's called the powell doctrine what are we missing a functioning executive that will translate will into action because we don 't have it every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing we an imminent threat since the cuban missile crisis in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two but we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we 're a democracy and that 's what it takes and if that doesn 't work we scream he 's got a gun just as we rush in and then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say jesus it was dark do you want to do it france france says no but i do like to criticize you after the fact what we need downstream is a great power enabled what i call that sys admin force we should have had two hundred and fifty thousand troops streaming into iraq no arms no muqtada al sadr i 'm wrecking his bones no insurgency talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months we had six months to feel the lob to get the job done why because they just got fed up they saw what we did to saddam they said you 're that powerful you can resurrect this country you 're america what we need is an international reconstruction fund sebastian check out their agenda since nine eleven all security dominated they 're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the imf you vote according to how much money you put in the kitty here 's my challenge to the defense department you 've got to build this force you 've got to seed this force you 've got to track coalition you will get this model you tell me it 's too hard to do i 'll walk this dog would you like kim jong il who 's killed about two million people would you like him gone this is why it matters to the military they 've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the cold war i 'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire which i can do because i 'm not inside the beltway i 'm we do desert storm the split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with and those who see a future that starts to scare them like the u s submarine community which the soviet navy disappear overnight ah so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of china all grown up going to be looker the i ask you who joins the military to do things other than war most of them don 't pick up a rifle i maintain this is code inside the army for we don 't want to do this they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world what i call the core and the gap the clinton administration wasn 't interested in running this for eight years after screwing up the relationship on day one inauguration day with gays in the military which was deft it hurts when i do this the doctor says stop doing that you idiot i used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early 1990s i 'd say you 're buying you are so right can you come back next year and remind us again some people say nine eleven heals the rift jerks the long term transformation gurus out of their thirty thousand foot view of history drags them down in to the muck and says you want a networked opponent i 've got one he 's everywhere go find him mootw how we pronounce that acronym and they call it empire which i think is a boneheaded concept empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets which you cannot do but maximum rule sets which you must do it 's not our system of governance never how we 've sought to interact with the i prefer that phrase system administration we enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy certain bad things you cannot do how everybody 's got an opinion going back to the beginning of our country historically defenses meant protection of the homeland security has meant everything else raise an army when you need it and maintain a navy for day to day connectivity a department of everything else a big stick a baton stick we merged these two things together in the defense department our long term rationale becomes we 're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets to attack america is to risk blowing up the world we connected national security to international security that 's that 's the scary part the question is how do we reconnect american national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet some people say hell nine eleven did it for you now we 've got a home game and an away game the department of homeland security is a strategic feel good measure it 's going to be the department of agriculture for the thousands standing around he was a bad guy with multiple priors it i knew we 'd kick ass in the war with what do i mean by these two different forces this it means you 've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same it 's too much the 19 year olds get tired from the switching ok that force on the left you can train a 19 year old to do that that force on the right is more the rule is going to be this that sys admin force is the force that never comes home does most of your work you break out that leviathan force only every so often but here 's the promise you make to the american public to your own people to the world you break out that leviathan you promise you guarantee that you 're going to mount one hell of a immediately don 't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace other differences leviathan traditional partners they all look like the brits and their former colonies laughter including us i would remind you the rest wider array of partners international organizations organizations private voluntary organizations contractors you 're not going to get away from that we 're done with that what we need to do is inter agency operations which frankly condi rice was in charge of i call the leviathan force your dad 's military educated married with children the force on the left up or out the force on the right in and out the force on the left respects posse comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the u s the force on the right 's going to obliterate it that 's where the national guard 's going to be the force on the left is never coming under the purview of the international criminal court sys admin force has to different definitions of network centricity one takes down networks one puts them up you 've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that do we need a bigger budget do we need a draft to pull this off absolutely not i we can do it faster cheaper smaller just as lethal i say great i 'm going to take the sys admin budget out of your hide here 's the larger point you 're going to build the sys admin force inside the u s military but over time it 's going to cross that river this is the marines in the audience get kind of tense and this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk this is the history of the marines marines are like my west highland terrier they get up every morning they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something i don 't want my marines handing out aid i want them to be marines that 's what keeps the sys admin force from being a pussy force it keeps it from being the u n you shoot at these people the marines are going to come over and kill you department of navy surface combatants are over there and the news is they may actually be that small bad news is they may not have anybody on them carriers go both ways because they 're a swing asset you 'll see the pattern airborne just like carriers armor goes this way here 's the dirty secret of the air force you can win by bombing shinseki was right with the argument fighters go over here special operations command down at tampa trigger pullers go this way civil affairs that bastard child comes over here return to the army the point about the trigger pullers and special operations command no off season these guys are always active they drop in do their business disappear see me now don 't talk about it later i was never so it 's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that what it 's not secret they said al qaeda could be listening they said well jesus they already know this stuff take a gift in the left hand these are the sunglasses that don 't scare censors and transparency the overheads go in both directions"
