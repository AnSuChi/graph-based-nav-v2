  "transcript": "i will never forget the excitement i will never forget but the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom it was the greatest sense of freedom that i could ever imagine i made my mind up there and then that so i did what i could in my life to get closer to that dream i had mashed potato and baked beans which cost 4p each and gravy was free and when that pile reached a pound i would drop it in and left school age seventeen to begin my apprenticeship in sailing so imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who i knew could make that dream come true and i could barely contain my excitement as i sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which i was going to sail solo nonstop around the world it was everything i 'd ever imagined just like in my dreams there were amazing parts and tough parts the wildlife and the remoteness after three months at sea age just twenty four i finished in second position but this time not in a race now for this i needed a different craft more powerful sixty foot wide she was a multihull when we built her no one had ever made it solo nonstop around the world in one though many had tried but whilst we built her a frenchman took a boat twenty five percent bigger than her but he took the record from ninety three days right down to seventy two this i know well because i was one of the five crew members on board five seconds is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater and that five seconds goes quickly just see how far below those guys the sea is imagine that alone the conditions were i was approaching a part in the ocean which was two thousand miles away from the nearest town and the nearest people would be those manning the european space station above me it takes four days for a ship to get to you and then four days for that and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard if we didn 't sail fast we all know what it 's like driving a car twenty miles an hour thirty forty it 's not too stressful we can concentrate we can turn on the radio take that fifty now you have white knuckles and you 're gripping the steering wheel now take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen wipers the windscreen the headlights and the brakes that 's what it 's like in the southern ocean even as a passenger you 're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in i was absolutely exhausted physically and mentally and after each change but out there those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs a few but you enter a different mode when you head out there boat is your entire world and what you take with you when you leave is all you have if i said to you all now go off into vancouver and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months that 's quite a task even toilet roll and toothpaste and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word finite what we have out there is all we have there is no more and never in my life had i ever translated that definition of finite that i 'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing until i stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record suddenly i connected the dots our global economy is no different i either put that stone to one side and learn more about it or i put that stone back and i carry on with my dream job i chose the first experts scientists economists to try to understand just how our global economy works and my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places this photo was taken in the but also very close to my family my and when you see that photo you see someone from another era no one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high in this day and age but yet that 's me with my great grandfather and by the way are not his real ears i remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches i went to the world coal association website and there in the middle of the homepage it said have about one hundred and eighteen years of coal left and i realized it 's nothing and it made me make a decision i never thought i would make to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge i 'd ever come across the future of our global economy and it was also materials in two thousand and eight i picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have of valuable materials to exponentially with more people in the world with more stuff we 've effectively seen one hundred years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just ten years and this affects all of us it 's brought huge volatility in prices so the more i started to change my own life i started traveling less doing less but it sat uneasy with me what could actually work it struck me that the system itself the framework within which we live is fundamentally and i realized ultimately the way our economy functions the way our economy 's been built i had to process them and as i looked at our global economy i realized it and i realized we 've been perfecting what 's effectively a linear economy for one hundred and fifty years but more an attempt to get out what we can at the end not by design why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up that would create waste but within it there is and i felt like the child in the garden for the first time on this new journey i could see exactly where we were headed i was excited this was something to work towards we knew exactly where we were headed we just had to work out how to get there and it was exactly with this in mind that we created the ellen macarthur foundation in september two thousand and ten and of course cradle to cradle design materials would be defined as either technical or biological waste would be designed out entirely and we would have a system that could function absolutely so what could this economy look like maybe we wouldn 't buy light fittings but we 'd pay for the service of light and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products what if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water and we could ultimately drink it it would never become waste what if engines were what if we could recover components from circuit boards reutilize them and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage energy ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems and rebuilding natural capital we don 't need to own the materials within them could cars become a service and provide us with mobility in the future and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy what lies before us is to expand them and scale them up so how would you shift from linear to circular we thought you might want to work with the best analysts and ask them the question can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use but also yes we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering two point seven times but what inspired me most about the circular economy was its ability to inspire young people they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon they can use their when you look at the lifetime of my great grandfather anything 's possible when he was born there were only twenty five cars in the world they had only just been invented when he was forty five we built the first computer many said it wouldn 't catch on but it did and just twenty years later we turned it into a microchip of which there will be thousands"
