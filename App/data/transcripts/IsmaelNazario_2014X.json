  "transcript": "we need to change the culture in our jails and prisons especially for young inmates new york state is one of only two in the u s that automatically arrests and tries as adults this culture of violence takes these young people and puts them in a hostile environment and the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on there 's not really much for these young people to do to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them before i ever turned eighteen i spent approximately since there 's not much for you to do while you start pacing back and forth in your cell you start talking to yourself your thoughts start running wild and feel more hopeless since there 's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people they pretty much reenter 's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating c o s it but it 's a little more than that they come from the same and there 's nothing special about them they do pretty much everything anybody else in society does c o s they play the little high school kid games with each other they politic with one another and the female c o s gossip to each other of time with numerous amounts of c o s and let me tell you about this one in particular named monroe one day he pulled me in between the a and b doors which separate the north and south sides of our housing unit since there was a female officer working on the floor that i he kind of knocked the wind out of me because i know this is their house i have no wins all he has to do so i just gave him a look in his eyes and i guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble because you 're looking like you want to fight so he commenced to taking off his utility belt he took off his shirt and his badge and he said we could fight so i asked him you gonna hold a term that 's commonly used on rikers island meaning that you 're not going to say anything to anybody and you 're not going to report it he i just punched him right in his face and we began fighting right then and there towards the end of the fight so while we were tussled up he said to me so i replied very cocky believe it you come across some c o s on rikers island that 'll fight you one on one they feel that they understand how it is and they feel that i 'm going to meet you where you 're at since this is how you commonly handle your disputes you walk away from it like a man and that 's it c o s feel that they 're jailing with you this is why they have that mentality and that attitude and they go by that concept in some instances we 're in it together with the c o s and they also need to give them proper trainings on how to deal with the mental health population as well c o s play a big factor in these young people 's lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case so why not try to mentor these young people while they 're there why not try to give them some type of insight to make a change so once they 're doing something positive a second big thing when i was on rikers island the huge thing was solitary confinement that 's what it was designed for the u s attorney general recently released a report stating that they 're going to ban solitary confinement in new york state for teens i read any and everything i could get my hands on and aside from that i wrote music and short stories some programs that i feel would benefit our young people are art therapy programs for the kids that like to draw and have that and what about the young individuals that are musically inclined how about a music program for them that actually teaches them how to write and make music just a thought when adolescents come to rikers island is the building that they 're housed in that 's nicknamed gladiator school because you have a young individual coming in from the street thinking that they 're tough being surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals from all of the five boroughs and everybody feels that they 're tough so now you have a bunch of young gentlemen poking their chests out feeling that i have to prove i 'm equally as tough as you or i 'm tougher than you you and you that culture is very dangerous and damaging to our young people we need to help institutions these teens realize that they don 't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led when they were on the street that they can actually make a change it what type of crimes they 're going to commit when they get back in the street man over here got this connection for the low price let 's exchange information and when we hit the town we 're going to do it real big i used to hear these conversations and think these dudes are really talking about going back in the street and committing future crimes so i came up with a name for i 've seen individuals take the state soap that 's provided for free and turn them into the most beautiful sculptures that would make michelangelo look like a kindergartner made it i just came out of the weight shack from working and i saw an older gentleman that i knew standing in the middle of the yard just looking up at the sky mind you this older gentlemen was serving a sentence in which he already had served twenty years of that sentence so i walk up to him and i said you know please let me know if you do then let me get some lottery numbers that plane with those people is going somewhere while we 're here stuck that 's life passing us by while we behind these walls stuck growing up i was always a good smart kid some people would say i was a little too smart for my own good i had dreams of becoming an architect currently i 'm working at the fortune society which is a reentry program and i work with people as a case manager that are at high so i connect them with the services that they need once they 're released from jail and prison i would sit down and talk to him and try to educate him and i would let him know listen this is me i 'm we are one everything that you 're about to do i know what you 're gonna do before you do it because i already did it and i would encourage him not to hang out with x i would tell him not to be in keep your behind in school man because that 's where you need to be because that 's what 's going to get you somewhere in life this is the message that we should be sharing with our young men and young women we shouldn 't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence that are nearly impossible for them to"
