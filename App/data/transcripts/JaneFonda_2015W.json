  "transcript": "i was these two women i 'm very honored to say have been my friends for a very long time too jane fonda yes we have pm and one of the things that i read about female friendship is something that cervantes said he said you can tell a lot about someone in this case a woman by the company that she keeps we have a very limited lt just being with her sucks the life out of me jf anyway sorry pm so tell me what do you look for in a friend lt i look for someone who has a sense of fun who 's audacious who 's forthcoming who has politics who has someone who 's decent has a sense of justice and who thinks i 'm worthwhile jf you know i was thinking this morning i don 't even know what i would do without my women friends i mean it 's course correcting i you know it 's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from when you 're getting toward the end i 'm approaching i 'll be there sooner than you lt no i 'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me jf i 'm showing you the way lt well you are and you have pm well as we grow older and as we go through different kinds of life 's journeys what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive lt and i look through my emails i look through my texts to find my friends so i can answer them as quickly as possible because i they need my support because most of my friends are writers or activists or actors and you 're all three and a long string of other descriptive phrases and i i want to get to you as soon as possible i want you to know that i 'm there for you jf do you do happiness and congratulations and sadness jf you spell it right out lt i spell it every letter jf i 've understood more the importance of friendships and so i really make an effort to reach out and make play dates not let too much time go by i read a lot so as lily knows all too well my books that i like i send to my friends lt when we knew we would be here today you sent me a lot of books about women female friendships and i was so surprised to see how many books how much research has been done recently jf and were you grateful lt i was grateful pm put aside marginalized there 's been very little research done on us even though we volunteered lots of times jf that 's for sure lt this is really exciting and you all will be interested in this the harvard medical school study has shown that women who have close female friendships are less likely to and they are are likely to be seen to be living much more vital exciting jf and longer lt joyful lives jf we live five years longer than men lt i think i 'd trade the years for joy lt but the most important part is they found the results were so so exciting and so conclusive the the researchers found that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health as much as smoking or being overweight only very recently have they researched what happens to women when we 're stressed and it turns out that when we 're stressed women our bodies get flooded by oxytocin which is a feel good calming stress reducing hormone which is also increased when we 're with our women friends and i do think that 's one reason why we we live longer and i feel so bad for men because they don 't have that testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin lt well when you and i and dolly made nine to five jf oh lt we laughed we did we laughed so much we found we had so much in common and we 're so different here she is like hollywood royalty i 'm like a tough kid from detroit [ dolly 's ] a southern kid from a poor town in in and we found we were so in sync as women our lifespans jf i think we sure crossed our legs a lot that jane sent us both to read on female friendship was one by a woman we admire greatly sister joan chittister who said about female friendship that as spiritual do they add something especially people you 've known a long time people you 've spent time with i can see the spiritual essence inside them the tenderness the vulnerability there 's actually kind of a love an element of love in the relationship i just see deeply into your soul friends there 's business friends and party friends i 've got a lot of those but the the friendships have we go deep and i find that i shed tears a lot with my not because i 'm sad but because i 'm so touched and inspired by them lt and you know one of you is going to go soon little mystified and i think we have to have a lot of empathy for men that they don 't have what we have which i think may be why they die sooner i have a lot of compassion for men because women no kidding we they 're revelatory we risk vulnerability this is something men don 't do i mean how many times have i asked you am i doing ok did i and men don 't you know people describe women 's relationships as whereas men 's friendships are more i mean most of the time men don 't want to reveal their emotions they want to bury deeper feelings i mean that 's the general conventional thought they would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or i mean it 's just the kind of it 's a more manly behavior jf i meant they might have sex if they could get somebody in their man cave to jf you know something though that i find very interesting and again psychologists didn 't know this until relatively recently is that men are born every bit as relational as women are if you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls you 'll see the baby boys just like the girls gazing needing that relational the dismay on the child even the boy would would cry they need relationship so the question is why as they grow older and the answer is patriarchal culture which says to to boys and young men that to to be needing of relationship to be emotional with someone is is girly that a real man doesn 't ask directions or express a they don 't go to doctors if they feel bad they don 't ask for help there 's a quote that i really like men fear that becoming ' we ' it 's what makes us strong it 's not that we 're better and that 's really important lt but men are so inculcated in the and we 've got to make something different happen lt well that 's what 's exciting about this subject it 's because our friendships female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood and sisterhood can be a very powerful force to give the world to make it what it should be the things that humans desperately need pm it is why we 're talking about it because women 's friendships are as you said jane a renewable source of power so how do we use that power jf women are the fastest growing demographic in the world especially older women and if we harness our power we can change the world and guess what we need to we kind of set the consumer standards we need to consume less we in the western world we need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels and the fossil fuel companies the exxons and the shell oils and those bad guys cause they are are going to tell us that we can 't do it without going back to the stone age you know that the alternatives just aren 't quite there yet and that 's not true there are countries in the world right now that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine and they tell us that if we do wean ourselves from fossil fuel that we 're going to be back in the stone and in fact if we begin to use renewable energy and not drill in the arctic and not drill because aristotle said most people people would die without male friendships and the operative word here was male because they thought that friendships should be between the best part it 's like you know men do need women now the planet needs women the jf every constitution that 's been written since the end of world war ii included a provision that made women citizens of equal stature but ours does not so that would be a good place to start very very mild it would lift all boats not just women pm needing new role models on how to do that how to be friends how to think about our power in different ways as consumers as citizens of the world and this is what makes jane and lily a role model of how women can be friends for a very long time and even if they occasionally"
