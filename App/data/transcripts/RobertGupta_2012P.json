  "transcript": "i yet came i 's a distinct privilege to be here a few weeks ago i saw a video on youtube of congresswoman gabrielle giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful this one entered her left hemisphere and and in this this session until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels and she sings let it shine and it 's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words in this case literally speak seeing this video of gabby giffords reminded me of the work of dr gottfried schlaug and schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called melodic intonation therapy which has become very popular in music therapy now schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic could not and after seventy hours of intensive singing lessons he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere 's damage when i was seventeen i visited dr schlaug 's lab and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non musicians how music and listening to music could just light up the entire brain from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression how deeply parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music but i had an ulterior motive of visiting gottfried schlaug and it was this that i was at a i wanted to become a doctor like paul farmer or rick these kind of fearless men who go into places like haiti or ethiopia and work with aids patients with i wanted to become that kind of red cross doctor that doctor without borders on the other hand i had played the violin my entire life music for me was more than a passion it was obsession it was oxygen i was lucky enough to have studied at the juilliard school in manhattan and to have played my and it turned out that gottfried schlaug and that afternoon i had to ask him how was it for you making that decision and he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to and that for me medical school could and after two more years of studying music i decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the mcat and applying to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr gupta laughter and i decided to to shoot for the impossible and i took an audition for the esteemed los angeles philharmonic and it was a dream but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family my new musical one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician nathaniel ayers was a double bassist at juilliard but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s nathaniel 's story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the united states and i told him that wherever he had his violin and wherever i had mine i would play a lesson with him and on the many times i saw nathaniel on skid row i witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments from what seemed to me in my untrained eye eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode playing for nathaniel the music took on a deeper meaning because now it was about communication a communication where words failed a communication of a message that went deeper than words that registered at a fundamentally primal level in nathaniel 's psyche yet came as a true musical offering from me i found myself growing outraged that someone like nathaniel could have ever yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on skid row alone who had stories as tragic as his but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off at the very core of this crisis of mine i felt somehow the life of music had chosen me perhaps possibly in a very naive sense i felt what skid row really needed was somebody like paul farmer but in the end it was nathaniel who showed me that if i was truly passionate about change if i wanted to make i already had the perfect instrument to do it that music was the bridge that connected my world and his there 's a beautiful quote by the romantic german composer robert schumann who said to send light into the darkness of men 's hearts such is the duty of the artist and this is a particularly poignant quote because schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum and inspired by what i learned from nathaniel performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on skid row performing for combat veterans and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally and that nobody ever came to visit them and that for the first time in six years when she heard us play she stopped shaking without medication the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room would never have access to the kind of music that we make as medicine serves to heal more the power and beauty of music transcends the e in the middle of our beloved acronym the synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by wagner or a symphony by brahms or chamber music by beethoven the deeply communal connected consciousness the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist iain mcgilchrist says is and for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within and incarceration the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them and we know whether we choose the path of music or of medicine the very first thing we must instill within our communities within our audiences if we want to inspire healing from within the the"
