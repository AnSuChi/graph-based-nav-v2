  "transcript": "i was there to solve world hunger phd student and i smiled as i thought to myself the engineer is here i 'm going to optimize everything and i 'm going to tell you the shortest fastest cheapest best set of routes to take for the food we you 're welcome i thought it was going to take twelve months ok maybe even thirteen this is not quite how it panned out just a couple of months into the project my french boss he told me it 's a good idea but the data you need for your algorithms is not there it 's the right idea but at the wrong time and the right idea at the wrong time is the wrong idea i look back now on that first summer in rome but we 're not there yet and brace yourself executives 'm going to be putting companies on the hot seat to step up and play the role that i know they can my experiences back in rome prove but eventually we got there let me paint the picture for you imagine that you have to plan breakfast lunch and dinner for five hundred thousand people only have a certain budget to do it say six point five million dollars per month well what should you do what 's the best way to handle it chickpea oil how much it sounds simple it 's not then for each food that you pick you need to decide how much you 'll buy where you 're going to get it from where you 're going to store it if you considered each option for a single second that would take you over twenty eight years to get through nine hundred million options so we created a tool that allowed decisionmakers to weed through all nine hundred million options it turned out to be incredibly successful and this meant that you had the ability to feed an additional eighty thousand people it 's all thanks to the use but we do it alone and orchestrating just the right types of engagements with academics with and i 've seen what companies aren 't doing and i think there 's three main ways that we can fill that gap and it 's the bonus it also makes good business sense some companies are already doing it they opened up their data in senegal and the ivory coast and that can tell you things like and you can make predictions with it they opened up their data and donated it and with that data you could track how droughts are impacting food production with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen this is a great start 's important insights just locked away in company data to academics to ngos to humanitarian organizations it wouldn 't be enough to harness that full impact of data for humanitarian goals why to unlock insights in data you need decision scientists decision scientists are people like me they clean it up transform it and put it into a useful algorithm that 's the best choice to address the business need at hand most of them work for companies they need to donate their decision scientists we need every spare second of their time but there 's a way but what it enables is really important long term partnerships long term partnerships allow you to build relationships to get to know the data to really understand it and to start to understand the needs and challenges that the humanitarian organization is facing in rome at the world food programme this took us five years to do five ok that was just what we couldn 't solve for then there was two years after that of refining and implementing the tool like in the operations in iraq but the types of results that can be produced are undeniable in our case it was the ability to feed so we have donating decision scientists and there 's actually a third way that companies can help donating technology to capture new sources of data you see there 's a lot of things we just don 't have data on right now syrian refugees are flooding into greece and the un refugee agency they have their hands full headquarters is essentially blind to this moment that 's all going to change in the next few weeks thanks to private sector collaboration so you know exactly and even more you know if she 's going to have supplies this month and the next information visibility drives efficiency and it 's led to major operational efficiency improvements just try to imagine your favorite beverage company trying to plan their inventory and it 's absurd data drives better decisions and you 're pragmatic and not just idealistic this is all great mallory but why should i want to be involved well for one thing they 're looking at information in credit card swipes and using that to find insights about how households in india live work earn and spend it 's a win all around for me what i find donating decision scientists and donating technology studies show that the next generation of the workforce care about having their work make a bigger impact and so through data philanthropy companies can actually help engage and retain their decision scientists and that 's a big deal for a profession that 's in high demand if we coordinated the planning and logistics across all of the major facets of a humanitarian operation we could feed clothe and shelter hundreds of thousands more people and companies need to step up and play the role that i know they can in bringing about this revolution revolution you 've probably heard of the saying food for thought well this is literally thought for food it finally is the right idea at the right time"
