  "transcript": "i want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you or if you it shows you that i also deal with issues where there 's not certainty of whether it 's unless the but i want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement on the third word because the third word is a description and by that i mean made by a description of your genitals now as a pediatric endocrinologist i used to be very very involved and still somewhat am in cases in which there are mismatches and we literally have to figure out but there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth that would define you and when i talk about definition i 'm talking about your sexual orientation we don 't say it 's a gay boy a lesbian girl nor do they describes do you see yourself as a male or female or somewhere in the spectrum in between shows up but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative for children and in fact there are studies that show that even eighty percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins but at the time that puberty begins that means between about age ten to twelve in girls twelve to fourteen in boys with breast budding or ' increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males by that particular point the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is those feelings no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things and my experience was more typical only because i had an adolescent genetically female went through harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story a registrar who always listed and came to me after graduating i know you know a lot of endocrinology and indeed i 've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads this wasn 't rocket science but i made a deal with him i 'll treat you if you teach me and so he did and then i got really confused because i thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the of the gender in which they were affirming but then my patient married he married a woman who had been born as a male had married as a male had two children then went through a transition and now this delightful female got legally married because they showed up as a man and a woman and who knew sexual orientation is who you go to bed with gender identity is who you go to bed as and i subsequently learned from the many adults i took care of about two hundred adults i learned from them i would never be able to guess better than chance whether they were gay straight bi or asexual in their affirmed gender in other words one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other and the data show it now as i took care of the two hundred adults i found it had to give up so much of their lives sometimes their parents would reject them and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children it was so awful but why did they do it at forty and fifty because they felt they had to affirm themselves and indeed the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest in the world so what to do in going to a conference in holland where they are experts in this and saw the most remarkable thing they were treating young adolescents after giving them the most intense psychometric testing and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn 't want until they go through puberty at which point if you feel you 're in the wrong sex you feel like pinocchio becoming a donkey the fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be with puberty actually is nullified by the puberty you get so that 's why putting the puberty on hold they 'll end up stunted in and you think you can have a meaningful conversation about the fertility effects of such treatment with a 10 year old girl they can have more and more testing they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them and then in a program they and then at age sixteen with retesting to receive now remember the blocking hormones are reversible but when you give the hormones of the opposite sex you now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice change depending on what you 're using and those effects are permanent and you can never really affect the voice so this is serious and this is and then at eighteen they 're eligible for surgery and while there 's no good surgery for females to males genitally the male to female surgery has fooled gynecologists so and i looked at patients except they were pubertally delayed i decided i 'm going to do this this is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in so i brought some kids in and this now became the standard of care and the [ boston ] children 's hospital was behind it by my showing them the kids before and after people who never got treated and people who wished to be treated and pictures of the dutch where were these kids before so we started a program in two thousand and seven it became the first program of its kind but it 's really of the dutch kind in north america and since then we have one hundred and sixty patients did they come from afghanistan and jackie had been abused in the midlands which means they were consigning them to an adult body no matter what happened even if they tested them well destined to be six feet five and yet she had just begun a male puberty well i did something a little bit and that estrogen is much more the growth plates and stopping growth than testosterone is so we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone but we added estrogen not at sixteen but at thirteen on the left and and she ended up five ' eleven than that she has normal breast size because by blocking testosterone every one of our patients has normal breast size if they get to us at the appropriate age and on the far right there she is she went public semifinalist in the miss england competition and one of them quipped i 'm told but she has more natural self than half the other contestants and and she 's become a remarkable spokeswoman and she was offered contracts as a model at which point she teased me when she said you know i might have had a better chance as a model if you 'd made me six feet one so this picture i think says it all it really says it all these are nicole and brother jonas identical and proven to be identical and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty 16 year old but it makes the point all the more of why you have to be conscious of where the patient is this is what nicole would look like if we weren 't doing what we were doing he 's got a prominent adam 's apple he 's got angular bones to the face a and you can see there 's a height difference because he 's gone through a growth spurt that she won 't get now nicole is on estrogen she has a bit of a form to her because of their work in overturning an and but nicole went personally to every legislator in maine and said i can do this but i can be threatened in the men 's room and then they finally got it we still have a ways to go in terms there are only seventeen states that have an law against discrimination in housing employment public accommodation only seventeen states and five of them are in new england and we need to get this condition out of the dsm it is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian and that went out the window in and this isn 't going to break anybody 's budget this is not that common but the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them but it also thank you"
