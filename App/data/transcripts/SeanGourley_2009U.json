  "transcript": "and the conflict seems well if you give me some so as a naive new zealander i thought well i 'll go to the pentagon can you get me some information and i saw that there was information there data within the streams of news that we consume all this noise around us actually has information we can perhaps start to understand the war so this is exactly what i did we started bringing a team together an interdisciplinary team of scientists of economists we brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this we did one hundred and thirty different sources of information from ngo reports to newspapers and cable news we extracted the key bits on information to build the database that database contained the timing of attacks the location the size and the weapons used it 's all what would that tell us and on the vertical axis you 've got the number of attacks so we plot data for sample on this you see some sort of random distribution perhaps sixty seven attacks one person was killed or forty seven attacks where seven people were killed we did this exact same thing for iraq and we didn 't know for iraq what we were going to find it turns out what we found was pretty surprising and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict this blew our mind why should a conflict like iraq have this we didn 't really understand that we thought and we looked at senegal and the same pattern and different socioeconomic problems and yet the fundamental patterns underlying them are the same so we went a little wider we looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on from peru to indonesia we and we found and we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack what we 're saying here is the probability of an attack killing x number of people in a country like iraq is equal to a constant and negative alpha is the slope of that line i showed you before so what this is data statistics what does it tell us about these conflicts that was a challenge we had to face as physicists how do we explain and what we really found was that alpha if we think about it is the organizational structure of the insurgency which is really the distribution of the group strength carrying out the attacks so we look at a process of group dynamics coalescence and fragmentation and we start running the numbers on this can we simulate it can we create the kind of patterns that we 're seeing in places like iraq we can run these simulations we can recreate this using a process of group dynamics why should these different seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns now what i believe is going on is that and if you don 't find that solution as an insurgent force how do we end a war like iraq what does it look like alpha is the structure it 's got a stable state at two point five this is what wars look like when they continue we 've got to change that but they are weaker or we push it down they 're more robust there is less groups but perhaps you can sit and talk to them structure of the insurgency"
