  "transcript": "you know cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy for students it 's quite an experience it could be very difficult so we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught so to address this virtual dissection table so with this anatomage table students can experience the dissection without a human cadaver and the table form is important and since just like the way they do dissections in the lab or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table our digital body so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy i 'm going to do as you can see i use my finger to interact with my digital body then it 's going to show inside maybe i can cut there see the brain and i can change my cut you can see some internal organs so we call this going to do another cut right there this shows a lot of internal structures so if i want to see the back side i can flip and see from behind images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you that means so our doctors said these are eye candies i 'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to peel off all the skin let 's say i 'm going to cut the liver right here i 'm going to do some surgery here and then you can see the inside of the heart you can see the atrium and the ventricles how blood flows to our and veins just like this students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to it doesn 't have to be always dissection since it 's digital we can do reverse dissection so let me show you i 'm going to start with the skeletal structure and i can add a few internal organs yep maybe i can add quickly this way and i can build muscles gradually just like that we can see tendons and muscles wish i could build my muscle this fast way to learn anatomy another thing i can show you is more often than not doctors get to meet patients in x ray form so anatomage table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear and also if you want you can compare just bring back the body and then it 's ready for another session it looks like our table also can transform gender too it 's a female now"
