  "transcript": "so today i want us to reflect on the demise of guys guys are flaming out academically they 're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women other than that there 's not much of a problem so what 's the data so the data on dropping out is amazing boys are thirty percent more likely than girls to drop out of school five boys drop out for every three girls girls outperform boys now at every level from elementary school to graduate school there 's a ten percent differential between getting ba 's and all graduate programs with guys falling behind girls two thirds of all students remedial programs are guys and as you all know what 's the evidence of wiping out first it 's a new fear of intimacy intimacy means physical emotional connection with somebody else and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous it 's a social awkwardness like you 're a stranger in a foreign land they don 't know what to say they don 't know what to do especially one on one [ with it turns out from earliest childhood boys and then men prefer of guys and there 's actually a cortical arousal we 're looking at because guys have been with guys in in teams in clubs in gangs in fraternities and this peaks at super bowl sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers watching a totally overdressed aaron rodgers of the green bay packers rather than jennifer lopez totally naked in the bedroom the problem is they now prefer to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships it 's an unintended consequence i think it 's excessive internet use in general excessive video gaming excessive new access to pornography drugs you want more of the same different so you need the novelty cindy gallop said men don 't know the difference and there 's some guy watching a hundred obviously and the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in america fifteen billion annually for every four hundred movies made in hollywood there are eleven thousand now made porn porn so the effect very quickly is it 's a new kind of arousal boys ' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change which are analog static interactively passive they 're also totally out of sync so what 's the solution it 's not my job i 'm here to alarm it 's your job to solve but who educators gamers filmmakers and women no offense to banana slug owners thank you"
