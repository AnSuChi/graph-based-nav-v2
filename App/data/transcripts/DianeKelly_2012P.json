  "transcript": "it doesn 't usually take very long for people to find out that i 'm a scientist and i study sex and then i get asked and the questions usually have a very particular format they start with the phrase me and then they end with the phrase is this true and most of the time i 'm glad to say that i can answer them but sometimes i have to say i 'm really sorry but i don 't know because i 'm not that kind of a doctor i 'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy and my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how so today i 'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric ivory tower activity that we find at our universities and now you know why i 'm fun at parties so today i 'm going to give you an example drawn from my penis study you how knowledge drawn from studies of one organ system provided insights into a very different one now i 'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows i did have to explain it to my nine year old late last week and the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals there 's an enormous amount of anatomical variation you inflatable cylinder that we 're all familiar with or at least half of you are and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes now the penis isn 't actually required for internal fertiliztion but when internal fertilization evolves penises often follow and the question i get when i start talking about this most often is what made you interested in this subject and the answer is i really wanted to find a dissertation project that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function i tried a bunch of different stuff a lot it didn 't pan out but then one day i started thinking about the mammalian penis and it 's really an odd sort of structure before it can be used for internal fertilization its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion most but before it 's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid it has to become difficult to bend a reproductive system that fails to function produces an individual that has no offspring and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool and so i thought here 's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system not one like this one but one like this one because indeed most animals don 't support their tissues by draping them over bones instead they 're more like reinforced water balloons and the interaction is crucial without both elements you have no support if you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up you have a puddle it has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid in this case blood surrounded by a wall of tissue that 's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen but at the time when i started this project the best explanation i could find for penal erection was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues and the spongy tissues filled with blood and pressure rose and voila it became erect and that explained to me expansion made sense more fluid you get tissues that expand but it didn 't actually explain erection hold on slow down because after about six months of me talking about this i think he finally figured out that i was really serious about the penis thing and he warned me he was like be careful going down this path i 'm not sure this project 's going to pan out because he was afraid i was walking into a trap i was taking on a socially embarrassing question and that was because it had the surrounding wall and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton so the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons cut so that you 're looking at the surface of the wall the arrow shows you the arranged in left handed and right handed angles and if you weren 't just looking at a little section of the fibers those fibers would be going in helices around the long axis of the skeleton something like a chinese finger trap where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck which i 'm going to demonstrate in a film it 's a model skeleton that i made out of a piece of cloth that i wrapped around an inflated balloon the cloth 's cut on the bias so you can see that the fibers wrap in helices now my adviser 's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic and that 's when they 're functioning penises don 't wiggle laughter so something interesting had to be going on so i sectioned it put it on slides and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety but instead i saw this there 's an outer layer and an inner layer the arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton i was really surprised at this everyone i showed it was really surprised at this why was everyone surprised at this and that was with fibers at zero degrees and ninety degrees to the long axis of the structure the thing is no one had ever seen it before in nature and now i was looking at one those fibers in that particular orientation give the skeleton a very very different behavior i 'm going to show a model made out of exactly the same materials but the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues they 're an integral part of the penile skeleton if the wall around the erectile tissue wasn 't there if it wasn 't reinforced in this way the shape would change but the inflated penis would not resist bending and erection simply wouldn 't work it 's an observation with obvious medical in humans as well soft robots basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important so to sum up i had a college adviser tell me when i went to the college and said i 'm kind of interested in anatomy they said anatomy 's a dead science i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies but up here in the meat end of the scale but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found thank you"
