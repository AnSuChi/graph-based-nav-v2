  "transcript": "and she called and she said i 'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer you a researcher i think but i 'm afraid if i call you a researcher no one will come because they 'll think you 're boring and irrelevant and i was like okay and she said but the thing i liked about your talk is you 're a storyteller so i think what i 'll do is just call you a storyteller and of course the academic insecure part of me was like i 'm a qualitative researcher i collect stories that 's what i do and maybe stories are just data and i 'm going to talk to you today we 're talking about expanding perception and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that i live and love and work and parent when i was a young researcher doctoral student it does not exist and i thought he was just sweet talking me i was like bachelor 's and a master 's in social work and i was getting my ph d in social work so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the life 's messy love it clean it up organize it and put it into a bento box and so to think that i had found my way to found a career that takes me really one of the big sayings knock discomfort upside the head and move it over but i want to be able to i want to understand them i want to hack into these things that i know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see so where i started was with connection because by the time you 're a social worker for ten years what you realize is that connection is why we 're here it 's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives this is all about it doesn 't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice mental health the ability to feel connected is so i thought you know what i 'm going to start with connection and she tells you you do really awesome and one opportunity for growth they 'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded and when you ask people so very quickly really about six weeks into this research i ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection and so i pulled back out of the research and thought i need to figure out what this is and it turned out to be shame and shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection is there something about me that if other people know it or see it that i won 't no one wants to talk about it and the less you talk about it the more you have it underpinned this shame this i 'm not good enough promoted enough the thing that underpinned this was this idea i 'm going in i 'm and i 'm going to outsmart it and i was really excited as you know it 's not going to turn out well so i could tell you a lot about shame but i 'd have to borrow everyone else 's time but here 's what i can tell you that it boils down to and this may be one of the most important things that i 've ever learned in the decade of doing this research my one year turned into six years hundreds of long interviews focus groups at one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories thousands of pieces of data and i kind of got a handle on it i kind of understood this is what shame is this is how it works but something was not okay okay and what it was is that if i roughly took the people i interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness that 's what this comes down to a sense of worthiness they have a strong sense of love and belonging and folks who struggle for it and there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they 're worthy of love and belonging that 's it they believe they 're worthy and to me the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we 're not worthy of connection was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness where i saw people living that way and just looked at those so i had a manila and i was like what am i going to call this research and the first words that came to my mind were i did it first in pulled the incidents what 's the theme what 's the pattern my husband left town with the kids because i always go into this jackson pollock crazy thing where i 'm just writing and and so here 's what i found what they had in common was a sense of courage and i want to separate courage and bravery when it first came into the english language it 's from the latin word cor and so these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect they had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others and this was the hard part as a result of authenticity they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be which you have to absolutely do that for connection they believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful they didn 't talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing they talked about the willingness to say i love you first the willingness to the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram they 're willing to invest in a relationship i personally thought it was betrayal where our job you know the definition of research is to control control and predict to study phenomena for the explicit explicit reason to control and predict and now this led to a little breakdown i call it a breakdown my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening and i had to put my data away and go find a therapist let me tell you something you know who you are when you call your friends and say i so i found a therapist here 's the thing and i know that vulnerability is the core but it appears that it 's also the birthplace of joy of creativity of belonging of love and i think i have a problem and i need some help and i said but here 's the thing no family stuff no childhood shit it just is what it is and i said oh my god this is going to suck and you know how there are people that when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important that they surrender and walk into it a that 's not me and b i don 't even hang out with people like that it was a slugfest vulnerability pushed i pushed back i lost the fight but probably won my life back and so then i went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the what we are doing with vulnerability why do we struggle with it so much am i alone in struggling with vulnerability we numb vulnerability i sent something out on twitter and on facebook that says how would you define vulnerability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half i had one hundred and fifty responses because i wanted to know what 's out there initiating sex with my husband initiating sex with my wife asking someone out this is the world we live in we live in a vulnerable world and one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability and i think there 's evidence and it 's not the only reason this evidence exists but i think it 's a huge cause we are addicted the problem is and i learned this from the research that you cannot selectively here 's the bad stuff i 'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin and i know that 's knowing laughter i hack into your lives for a living and it becomes this dangerous cycle one of the things religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty i 'm right that 's it there 's no discourse anymore there 's no conversation there 's just blame you know how blame is described in the research a way to discharge pain and discomfort we perfect because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks which just i hope in one hundred years people will look back and go wow let me tell you what we think about children and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand our job is not to say look at her she 's perfect my job is just to keep her perfect make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and yale by seventh that 's not our job our job is to look and say you know what you 're imperfect and you 're wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging show me a generation of kids raised like that and we 'll end the problems i think that we see today we pretend that what we do doesn 't have an effect on people we do that in our personal lives we do that corporate whether it 's a bailout an oil spill we pretend like what we 're doing doesn 't have a huge impact on other people i would say to companies this is not our we just need you to be authentic and real and say we 're sorry we 'll fix it vulnerably seen to love with our whole hearts even though there 's no guarantee and that 's really hard and i can tell you as a parent that 's excruciatingly difficult to practice gratitude and joy can i be this fierce because to feel this vulnerable means i 'm alive and the last which i think is probably the most important i believe that says i 'm enough then we stop screaming and start listening we 're kinder and gentler to the people around us and we 're kinder and gentler to ourselves that 's all i have"
