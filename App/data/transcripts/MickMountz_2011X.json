  "transcript": "or share with you a breakthrough new approach for managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse you were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t shirt so click you put it into your shopping cart and maybe a blue pair of shoes click but you hit submit order so i 'm here to tell you it 's that guy right there so deep in the middle of that classically these pick workers will spend sixty or seventy percent of their day wandering around the warehouse they 'll often walk as much as five or ten miles in pursuit of those items of not only is this an unproductive way to fill i worked for a fabulously spectacular flame out called webvan and it really came down to the fact that we couldn 't do it cost effectively turns out e commerce was something that was very hard and very costly and when you think about it it was costing us thirty dollars imagine we had an eighty nine can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that so long story short during my one year at webvan what i realized by talking to all the material handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve getting those three things in a box goo to retail stores of course webvan let me just focus briefly on what i wanted as a pick worker or my vision for how it should work i have an order here the product shows up and i pack it into the order this is what i need what technology is available to solve this problem probably a technique that many of you use but then test your ideas land is cheap and we said specifically what if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor and we could build a distribution center so naturally that led to ideas that said let 's put lots of people in the warehouse and i said hold on zero dollars per hour what i would do is ' hire but when i need diet coke and i call it you guys talk labor isn 't free on that practical that practical versus awesome spectrum laughter so we said mobile shelving we 'll put them on mobile shelving i about fell out of my couch when i saw this i 'm like that was the idea we 'll put thousands of people on the warehouse floor the stadium interestingly enough this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful impressive digital art all without computers it speaks to the power of emergence in systems when you let things start to talk with each other here is a warehouse it 's a pick pack and ship center that has about ten thousand different we send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods and we deliver them to the side of the building so all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter take them down the highway and deliver them she gets to stay still in a pick station like this and every product in the building can now come to her pack it out by the time you turn around there 's another product there ready to be picked and waited time and we 've developed and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into so more productive more accurate and it turns out it 's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers and they feel a little bit more in control of their environment so but we didn 't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse what effectively this approach is doing inside of the dc is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine so this is again and we 're thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures the notion here is that you have ten workers on the right side of the screen contrast that for a moment everyone has to be in place for that serial process to this becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse and then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we 're tracking the popularity of the products and we 're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to so what you see here potentially the week leading up to valentine 's day all that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations the leftover candy has all drifted to the back of the warehouse and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there one other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale to ginormous so whether you 're doing two pick twenty pick stations or two hundred pick stations the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work in this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because that 's where the pick stations were they sorted it out for themselves so i 'll conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick worker 's actual we direct the pods across the highway and we 're attempting to get into a queuing system to present the work to the pick worker what 's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers the faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few the product jumps into it or she has to reach in and get it never has any idle time never has to leave her mat not only a more productive and more accurate and sometimes we 'll catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as they have more energy after the the kiva zone is so stress free that i 've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication that was at a pharmaceutical distributor so they told us not to use that video so what i wanted to leave you with today is the notion that that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own interesting productivities can emerge you break it open and the goo is in there you 'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order"
