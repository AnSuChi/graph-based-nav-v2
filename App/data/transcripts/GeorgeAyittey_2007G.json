  "transcript": "ted global for putting this conference is going to rank as the most important 21st century think african governments will put together a conference like this you think the a u will put together a conference like this even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid i would also like to pay and the other ted fellows i call them the cheetah generation the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption in contrast of course we have the hippo generation they are stuck in their intellectual patch they wouldn 't move one foot if you ask them to reform the economies they 're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo now there are a lot of africans who are very angry angry at the condition of africa and in a way africa is more than a tragedy in more ways than one there 's another enduring tragedy and that tragedy is but helping africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd it 's like the blind leading the clueless there are certain things that we need to recognize africa leaks did you know that forty percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa it 's taken out of africa that 's what the world bank there are people who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl which leaks what corruption alone costs africa one hundred and put that aside every year africa spends twenty billion dollars to import food that 's far more than the fifty billion tony blair wants to raise for africa we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong you know it i know it but let 's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we 'll spend all day here let 's move on and flip over to the next chapter and that 's what this conference is all about the next chapter the next chapter begins with first of all asking ourselves this fundamental question whom do we want to help in africa there and then there is the government indicated that in my view is even more charitable i said since one thousand nine hundred and since one thousand nine hundred and sixty and i asked them to name me just twenty good leaders you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself i asked them to name me just twenty everybody mentioned nelson mandela couldn 't go beyond fifteen even if they had been able to name me twenty what does that tell you twenty out of two hundred and four means that and if you look at them the slate of the post colonial leaders quack revolutionaries now this leadership the second premise that we make when we 're trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government there is one particular quote a lesotho chief once said that here in lesotho we 've got two problems rats and the government what you and i understand as a government doesn 't exist in many african countries in fact what we call our governments are vampire states the richest people in africa are and ministers and quite often the chief bandit is the head of state himself where do they get their money the third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that we must know where the african people are take any african economy there is the informal sector and the traditional sector the modern sector is the abode of the elites it 's the seat of government in many african countries it is a meretricious fandango of imported systems which the elites themselves don 't understand that is the source of many of africa 's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over claiming innocent lives now the modern sector of course is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into more than eighty percent of ivory coast 's development went into the modern sector the other sectors the informal and the traditional sectors you go where the people are the informal and the traditional sectors now traditional sector is where africa produces its agriculture and that 's why it must import food all right you cannot develop africa by ignoring develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work first one is the political system traditionally they hate tyranny if you look into their traditional systems africans organize their states the first one belongs to those ethnic societies so they didn 't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority made sure that they surrounded the chiefs for example the chief cannot make any decision and if the chief doesn 't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed if not the people will abandon the chief go somewhere else and set up set up a new settlement and even if you look in ancient african all organized around one particular principle the confederacy principle now compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on africa in the economic system the means of production is privately owned it 's owned by extended families you the american will say i am because and i can damn well do anything i want connotes community they own farms they decide what to do what to produce they decide what to do and when they produce their crops they sell the surplus on marketplaces when they make a profit it is theirs to keep not for the chief to sequester it from them so kano salaga they were all there even if you go to west africa you notice that market activity in west africa has always been dominated by women what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism all of a sudden markets capitalism became became a western institution and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism nonsense the socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of swiss bank socialism which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder africa go back to africa 's indigenous institutions and this is where we charge the cheetahs and i 'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector tried to mobilize africans in the diaspora to invest in he will be able to employ more ghanaians it also means that he will be able to generate wealth this is an area a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area this is where we need to mobilize africans in the diaspora especially to invest in this we also need to mobilize africans in the diaspora not only to go into the traditional sectors but to go into agriculture and also to instigate we were able to mobilize ghanaians in the diaspora to to instigate change in ghana and bring about democracy in ghana we can take africa back one village at a time thank you very much"
