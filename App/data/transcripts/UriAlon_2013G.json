  "transcript": "and i lost all sense of direction but i had enough support maybe there 's a pattern here but doing research is nothing like that at goes into the unknown because you have to make a scene onstage without a in improvisation theater they tell you from day one what 's going to happen to you when you get onstage you 're going to fail miserably you 're going to get stuck and we we would practice staying creative inside that stuck place and everybody else applauded and cheered you on supporting you onstage i don 't know what to do i 'd how to guide someone to go together into the unknown and i told my students from day one what 's going to happen when you start research and this has to do with our mental schema of what research will be like because you see whenever people do anything for example if i want to touch this blackboard my brain first builds up a schema a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do before i even start moving my hand and if i get blocked but if you believe and if you believe textbooks you 're liable to have the following schema of research if a is the question and b is the answer then research is a direct path the problem is that if an experiment doesn 't work or a student gets depressed it and that 's why i teach my students a more realistic an example where things don 't match if a is the question b is the answer until you reach a place linked with negative emotions where it seems like your basic assumptions have stopped making sense now you can be lost in the cloud for a day a week a month a year but sometimes if you 're lucky enough and you have enough support you can see in the materials at hand or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud a new answer experiments don 't work but as long as you don 't forget the path that brought you there now this cloud is an inherent part of research an inherent part of our craft because the cloud stands guard at the boundary it stands guard at the boundary between the known because in order to discover something truly new at least one of your basic assumptions has to change every day we try to bring ourselves to the boundary between the known and the unknown and face the cloud but c is always more interesting and that 's the amazing thing about resesarch now just knowing that because students come to me and say uri i 'm in the cloud and i say great you must be feeling miserable since the way our mind works it 's just knowing that the cloud it 's essential we can join the cloud appreciation society and it detoxifies the feeling that something is deeply wrong with me i know what to do which is to step up my support for the student because research in psychology shows that if you 're feeling fear and despair your mind narrows you need other emotions solidarity support hope that come so here improvisation theater came to my help again it 's called saying yes and to the offers made by other actors that means accepting the offers and building on them and everybody feels frustrated that 's called blocking if you 're not mindful of communications scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking it 's pulling us to the moon critic we all have an inner critic that kind of guards what we say so people don 't think that we 're obscene or crazy or unoriginal and science is full of the fear of appearing unoriginal saying yes and bypasses the critic and unlocks hidden voices of creativity you didn 't even know that you had and they often carry the answer about the cloud so you see knowing about the cloud and about saying we were stuck for a year trying to understand the intricate biochemical networks inside our cells and we said we are deeply in the cloud and we had a playful conversation where my student shai shen orr said let 's just draw this on a piece of paper this network and instead of saying but we 've done that so many times and it doesn 't work i said yes and let 's use a very big piece of paper and then ron milo said let 's use a gigantic architect architect 's blueprint kind of paper and i know where to print it and we printed out the network and looked at it and that 's where we made our most important repeating interaction patterns like motifs in a stained glass window we call them network motifs and they 're the elementary circuits that help us understand soon enough after this i started being invited to give talks to thousands of scientists across the world but the knowledge about the cloud and saying and their ways of thinking narrowed down to very safe paths their science didn 't reach its full potential and they were miserable i thought that 's the way it is i 'll try to make my lab as creative as possible and if everybody else does the same science will eventually become more and more better and better that way of thinking got turned on its head when by chance i went to hear evelyn fox keller give a talk about her experiences as a woman in science it 's not by chance 's a matter of values but we also have a cultural myth that the doing of science what we do every day to get that knowledge is also only objective and rational like mr spock automatically the other side the subjective and emotional become labeled and when i heard that and i can be a change agent working to change the culture of science wherever i could and so the very i was in the cloud and eventually i managed to get out the cloud using improvisation and music since then every conference i go to i give a science talk and a second special talk called love and fear in the lab and i start it off by doing a song about scientists ' greatest fear and somebody else publishes it before we do and being scooped feels and so i do a blues song and i tell them your text is ' scoop thank you and we start talking about the emotional and subjective things so my vision is that just like every scientist knows the word atom that matter is made out of atoms every scientist would know the words like the cloud saying yes and and would also be much more playful and what i might ask you to remember from this talk is that next time you face a problem you can 't solve in work or in life there 's a word for what you 're going to see the cloud and you can go through the cloud not alone but together with someone who is your source of support to say yes and to your ideas to help you say yes and to your own to increase the chance that through the wisps of the cloud you 'll find that moment of calmness where you get your first glimpse of your unexpected discovery your"
