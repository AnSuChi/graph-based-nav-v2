  "transcript": "the second is and the third is the aim and the task are all misconceived so what i 'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim an aim and a task which i think give one i 'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown i don 't have an overview i can look at the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined when you actually look at opinion polls across time there 's not much evidence for that that 's to say the people who were mistrusted twenty years ago principally journalists and politicians are still mistrusted the rest of us are in between but is that good evidence what opinion polls now if somebody said to you do you trust greengrocers do you trust fishmongers do you trust elementary school teachers you would probably begin and that would be a perfectly sensible response and when you understood the answer to that well i trust some of them but not others that 's a perfectly rational thing we don 't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office holder or i might for example say that i certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher i know to teach the reception class to read but in no way to drive the school minibus i might after all know that she keep a conversation going but not but perhaps not to keep a secret simple so if we 've got those why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust well frankly i think that 's a stupid aim it 's not what i would aim at i would aim aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy in fact i aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy placed their savings with the very aptly named okay that means that what matters in the first place is judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things are they competent are they honest are they reliable and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters and reliable and honest we 'll have a pretty good reason to trust them because they 'll be trustworthy but if on the other hand they 're unreliable we might not i have friends who are competent and honest but i would not trust them to post a letter because they 're forgetful i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things but i realize that they overestimate their own competence and i 'm very glad to say i don 't think i have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest but that 's what we 're looking for trustworthiness before trust trust is the response trustworthiness is what we have to judge and of course it 's difficult across the last few decades we 've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness a lot of these systems have the converse effect they don 't work as they 're supposed to i remember i was talking with a midwife who said well you see the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby and all over our public life our institutional life we find that that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and like midwives from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes as we say you can all give your own examples there i think is more trustworthiness and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people and if we are trying to judge whether other people or it is judgment and simple reaction attitudes don 't do we can do that for ourselves we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness we can do it two people together trying to improve trust but trust in the end is distinctive because it 's given by other people you can 't rebuild what other people give you you have to give them the basis for giving but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy how to do it well every the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back i trust them because they have made vulnerable to me so in the end i think what we are aiming for is not it is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge so let alone about useful and simple evidence that"
