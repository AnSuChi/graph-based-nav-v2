  "transcript": "i study ants in the desert in the tropical forest and in my kitchen and in the hills around silicon valley where i live and that got me thinking that we could learn from this about other systems like brains so what all these systems have in common is that there 's no central control an ant colony consists of sterile female workers those are the ants you see walking around and then one or more reproductive females who just lay the eggs they don 't give any instructions even though they 're called queens and all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple interactions and they interact with their antennae so when one meets another it doesn 't matter which ant it meets and they 're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message all that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants produce a network and it 's this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest or how many are going out to forage and they 're using interactions differently to meet different environmental challenges one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs just what it takes to run the system finding them and collecting them and the seed eating ants that i study in the desert have to spend water to get water so an ant outside foraging and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel into the nest and meeting outgoing foragers on their way and the more foragers they send out and we 've been studying the evolution of this system first of all there 's variation it turns out that colonies are different on dry days some colonies forage less so colonies are different in how they manage this trade off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds and we 're trying to understand why some colonies forage less than others by thinking about ants as neurons using models from neuroscience and this raises an analogous question about brains we talk about the brain but of course every brain is slightly different and that would lead to differences in brain function so in order to ask evolutionary questions we need to know about reproductive success this is a map of the study site where i have been tracking this population of harvester ant colonies for twenty eight years which is about as long as a colony lives and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had because we were able to use genetic variation to match up parent and offspring colonies that is to figure out and this was amazing for me after all these years to find out for example colony one hundred and fifty four whom i 've known well for many years and these are her great granddaughter colonies and by doing this i was able to learn that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies in their decisions about which days are so and the offspring of parent colonies live so far from each other that the ants never meet over the time of the study and especially in the past ten years there 's been a very severe and deepening drought in the southwestern and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies while the other colonies were out foraging getting lots of food she 's one of the rare great grandmothers on the site to my knowledge this is the first time that we 've been able to track the ongoing evolution of collective behavior and guess what we call this analogy the anternet is coming so data doesn 't leave the source computer unless it gets a signal that there 's enough bandwidth for it to travel on in the early days of the internet when operating costs were really high and it was really important not to lose any data then the system was set up for interactions to activate the flow of data but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms that we know about and ants have had one hundred and thirty million years to evolve a lot of good so what happens when operating costs are low operating costs are low in the tropics because it 's very humid and it 's easy for the ants to be outside walking around but the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics competition whatever resource one species is using another so in this environment interactions are used in the opposite way the system keeps going unless something negative happens and one species that i study makes circuits in the trees of foraging ants going from the nest to a food source and back just round and round unless something negative happens like an interaction so here 's an example of ant security in the middle there 's an ant plugging the nest entrance with its head in response to interactions and maybe there are situations in computer security where operating costs are low enough so another environmental challenge that all systems have to deal with finding and collecting them and this is a problem that 's of great interest right now in robotics because we 've understood that rather than sending a single sophisticated expensive robot out to explore another planet or to search a burning building it may be more effective to get and that 's the way that ants do it so the invasive argentine ant makes expandable search networks they 're good at dealing with the main problem of collective search which is the trade off between and what they do is when there are many ants in a small space then each one can search very thoroughly because there will be another ant nearby searching over there but when there are a few ants in a large space then they need to stretch out their paths to cover more ground and they search more thoroughly different ant species must use different algorithms because they 've evolved to deal with so the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up but it would be interesting to know how other species solve this problem in different and so we 're setting up a program to encourage kids around the world and i think it 's pretty likely that the invasive species the ones that come into our buildings are going to be really good at this because they 're in your kitchen because they 're really good at finding food and water and the ants that specialize on clustered resources use interactions now this is a place where i think we might be able to learn something from ants about cancer i mean first it 's obvious that we could do a lot to prevent cancer but we might be able to learn something from ants about treating cancer so if you think from the perspective of early metastatic cancer cells as they 're out searching around if those resources are clustered and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting then maybe we could set traps and we could learn from this about other systems that operate without central control thank you"
