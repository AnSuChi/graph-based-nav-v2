  "transcript": "and i feel like this whole evening has been very amazing 's sort of like the vimalakirti sutra an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area vaishali and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him all the young people actually from the city the old fogeys don 't come because they 're mad at buddha because when he came to their city he accepted he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him from whoever it is and the local geisha a movie star sort of person raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first and of course they were grumbling he 's supposed to be religious and all this what 's he doing over there at amrapali 's house with all his five hundred monks and as soon as they had laid all these all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient india he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium the wonder of the universe everyone looked in that and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life and of course in the buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets so they don 't when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky they don 't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases they actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that he made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and then leilei told us about interconnection and how we 're all totally interconnected here and i didn 't give the talk always become tedsters if that 's i guess so because in a way if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything and therefore it will become intolerable what compassion is is where it will become intolerable for us totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have it just becomes with all of us knowing everything we 're kind of forced by technology and of course we all will be deeply disappointed when we do because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do a little bit tired but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other and ultimately it fails of course and then we 're back into this thing from the buddha 's point of view misperception is that all we are is what is inside our skin and it 's inside and outside self and other right you know someone sitting next to you in a seat that 's ok because you 're in a theater if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you you 'd freak out and so you wouldn 't sit that close to another person because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone each of us and everyone else is different then that puts us in an impossible situation doesn 't it who is it who 's going to get enough attention from the world who 's going to get enough out of the world who 's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings if you 're different from all the other beings so where compassion comes is where through knowledge actually knowing that you have no such boundary knowing your interconnectedness with other beings you can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them when you do that you 're forced to feel what they feel they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the buddhist literature they say i go from birth to death i 'm never satisfied i never have enough even if i 'm a billionaire i don 't have enough i need a hundred billion so i 'm like that imagine if i had to feel even a hundred other people 's it would be terrible but apparently this is a strange paradox of life when you 're no longer locked in yourself and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world that enables you to let your mind spread out and empathize and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing you can see the deeper nature of life and you can you can you get away from this like the beatles used to sing you know we really learned everything in the ' 60s too bad nobody ever woke up to it and but when we 're relieved from that we somehow then become interested in all the other beings and we feel ourselves differently it 's totally strange it 's totally strange the dalai lama always likes to say he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion it 's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that or what you know and the more you focus on how you feel by the way the worse it gets and then it 's never good enough i love that leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes i think the dalai lama should have heard that i wish he 'd been there to hear that he once told me he looked kind of sad he worries very much about the haves and saying they were going to give it to everyone and then they were even worse they didn 't help at all and so then he looks at me generosity was all i could think of i think the key to saving the world the key to compassion is that it is more fun it should be done by fun generosity is more fun that 's the key everybody has even though his people are being genocided and believe me he feels every blow on every old nun 's head but he feels it and yet he 's very because when you open up like that then you can 't just what good does it do to add being miserable with others ' misery look at that beautiful thing chiho showed us she scared us with the lava man then the so and the human being actually is compassion the human being is almost out of time the human being is compassion because what is our brain he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings and he would have tremendous fun doing that"
