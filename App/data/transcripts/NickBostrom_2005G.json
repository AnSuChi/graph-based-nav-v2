  "transcript": "talk today about and i 'm going to tell you what i think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers which is encouraging if you so the which is a huge number by any standard the biggest cause of death aging it accounts for roughly sometimes we don 't see a problem because either it 's too familiar or it 's too big can 't see it because it 's too big i think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem this is not statistical points these are let 's see how far have i talked i 've talked for so that would be roughly three hundred and twenty four people have died since i 've begun speaking people like it 's roughly the population in this room has just died the human cost of that is obvious once you start to think about it the suffering the loss it 's i just look at the information and knowledge and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general and aging in particular suppose we approximated one person with one book now of course this is an underestimation a person 's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book but let people die of natural causes each year corresponds to fifty two million library of congress holds eighteen million volumes we are upset about the burning of the library of alexandria it 's one of the great cultural tragedies but this is the equivalent of three libraries of congress burnt down forever lost each year and other people like him to try to do something about this as soon as possible existential risk is a threat to human survival or to the long term potential of our species now i say that this is a big problem well let 's first look at the probability and this is very very difficult to estimate but there have been only four studies on this in recent years which is surprising you would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big but it 's a very neglected area but there have been four studies one by john lesley wrote a book on this he estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current whom we heard speak yesterday also has a fifty percent probability estimate another author doesn 't give any numerical estimate but says the probability is significant that it will fail i wrote a long paper on this i said now if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point living people the current generation now one percent of six billion people is so that 's a large number if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up then the figure becomes astronomical if we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe the virgo supercluster maybe it will take us one hundred million years to get there but if we go extinct we never will then even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number ten to the power of thirty two every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant the only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve and now let me the rest of my time on the third big problem because it 's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp think about some time in your life some people might never have experienced it but some people there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic it might have been at the moment inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage or when you understood something you had never done before or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love or an aesthetic experience a sunset or a why can 't it be like that all the time you just want to cling onto this and then of course it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades and it 's really difficult to recall the third big problem is that life isn 't usually as wonderful as it could be i think that 's a big it 's easy to say what we don 't want here are a number of things that stunted growth suppose we fixed these things we did something about all of these we were very successful we got rid of all of these things we might end up with something like this which is i mean it 's a heck of a lot better than that but is this really the best we can dream of is this the best we can do or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring and if we think about this i think it 's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things not just by eliminating negatives but adding positives on my wish list at least would be much longer healthier lives greater unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits better relationships an unbounded potential for spiritual moral and intellectual development if we want to achieve this what in the world would have to change and this is the answer but the way we are our very biology now when we think about changing human nature the first thing that comes to mind are these stimulants like ritalin adderall it 's a pretty pathetic list they do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition but for most people they don 't really transform what it is to be human and they also all seem a little bit most people have this instinct that well sure there needs to be anti depressants for the really depressed people but there 's a kind of queasiness that these are it 's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use we have skin enhancements clothing as far as i can see all of you are users of this enhancement technology so that 's a great thing anesthetics we take that very much for granted but just think about how great progress that is like having an operation before anesthetics was not fun and brain reprogramming techniques that sounds ominous but the distinction between what is a technology a gadget would be the archetype and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle so if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read you 're actually literally rewriting your own brain you 're changing the so in a broad sense we don 't need to think about technology as only little gadgets like these things here but even institutions and techniques psychological methods and so forth forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature looking ahead there is range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later we are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws and even just a couple of these would be enough to 's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement health span is a big intellectual capacity let 's take that box which falls into a lot of different why we value these traits is but part of the reason and that 's the reason why we have it 's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with and to remember what you have learned modalities and special faculties now the human mind is not a single unitary information processor but it has a lot of different special evolved modules that do specific things for us if you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning music humor chatting with people all of these very likely are enabled by a special circuitry that that we humans have but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these we 're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it all of these would enable in principle be amenable to enhancement some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have it 's also interesting to think about what other things are so if these all enabled great values why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be imagine a species that just didn 't have this neural machinery for processing they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance like the one we just heard because of people making stupid movements and they would be really irritated and wouldn 't see what we were up to but maybe they have another faculty something else that would seem equally irrational to us but they actually tap into some great possible value there but we are just literally deaf to that that kind of value so we could think of adding on different new sensory capacities and mental faculties bodily functionality and morphology and affective self control greater subjective well being be able to switch between relaxation and activity being able to go slow when you need to do that and to speed up able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do easier to achieve the flow state when you 're totally immersed in something you are conscientiousness and sympathy the ability to it 's another interesting application that would have large social ramification perhaps if you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person undiminished through time so that wouldn 't have to love would never have to fade if you didn 't want it it 's been done in in voles you can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it 's naturally polygamous it 's just a single gene might be more complicated in humans but perhaps not that much this is the last picture down here in this little corner here we have the little sub space of this it 's a part of the space that 's accessible to animals since we are animals we are a subset of that and then you can imagine then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are so then you move off to this larger and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being"
