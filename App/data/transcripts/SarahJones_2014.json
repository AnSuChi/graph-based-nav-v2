  "transcript": "first of all for those of you who are not familiar with my work i create multicultural characters so characters from lots of different backgrounds so before the present is the new future a bit about the but i was totally immersed in this world that was and then i went on to the united nations school and that just completely so i began all of whom were loosely based on people i really know and so for example i don 't really talk and i 'm going to bring a few of my friends i think of them as my friends to this stage in this spirit of the idea that the i don 't know if that 's true for other people but that notion of thinking about how we can understand the future and predict outcomes for me 's terrifying to not know what might be coming and so the idea that there are questions that i 've never seen and all i can do is remind myself that i told chris i 'd fly by the seat of my pants and now that i 'm up here it sort of feels like that dream where you don 't have any pants on and so i suppose i 'm going to be flying by the seat of my ass that said let 's just see who comes out may we have the first question do you ever get headaches from the microchips implanted in your brain my name is and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain frankly i 'm glad that you all enjoy them but at my age just putting on the regular ones i have already gives me too much information understand what i 'm saying to you i don 't i don 't want to know it 's fabulous to be here with such big machers again this year but i also i just need to acknowledge that ted is an incredible experience right now in the present like i don 't know i just need to say that that 's incredible to me and sometimes when i 'm nervous and everything like that i just need to like say some affirmations that can help and unbelievable and then right after and i 'm standing there and i was just like please don 't say oh my god don 't say oh my god and i just kept saying it oh my god oh my god i couldn 't process it was really however you reproduce as long as you 're enjoying yourself and it 's with you know where i 'm going with that i think sarah jones maybe she didn 't want me to come out last time i don 't know why you know what i 'm saying obviously i would be like a perfect fit for first of all that i 'm in hip hop you know what i 'm saying i know some of y 'all may be not really as much into the music but the first way y 'all can always that i 'm in hip hop is ' cos i hold the microphone in an official emcee posture y 'all can see that right there that 's how you hold it all right so you get your little tutorial right there but when sarah jones told me we was gonna come up here i was like betch you know what i 'm saying ted is real fly i got a whole lot of dope i would have to say my top five songs right now is all out of my own personal catalogue you know what i mean so if you want to know more about that you know what i 'm saying we could talk about the that needs to be sustainable and everything and i mean i mean this right here this environment i would like to sustain you know what i mean but i 'm just saying if y 'all are interested in the top five songs you need to holler at me but i can tell you that it is so challenging to me kind of thinking about this concept of the future and that you know all all around the world parents are kind of 3d printer all day so that you can have this meal you know that kind of thing and of course now that we have changed you know from the global south there is this total kind of perspective shift that is happening around the but as you can tell i have kind of that optimism and i do hope that we can continue to kind of 3d print well let us just say i like to think that even in the future we will have the publication kind of you know but everybody please do enjoy that and again i think that you do do throw a cracking good party here at ted thank you because i was born in the ' 90s and like there were a lot of women who were as far as feminism was concerned like maybe they didn 't understand that like a feminist like me like prove that you are a feminist like not that there 's anything wrong with that but my mom i like my voice like she 's not a word that i created that means like so strict it 's ridiculous so that 's so my name is joseph mancuso first of all i just want to say that i appreciate that ted in general has been a pretty orderly crowd a pretty orderly group you know i just have to say the whole thing with baldness and you know here 's the thing enjoy yourself as much as you think they do you know she said she would love him even if he had snow on the roof or even if melted and disappeared altogether so that 's it that 's it that 's it i don 't got nothing more to say keep your noses clean because i have really my chinese identity but my kids myself in front of audience of people like this but if had to give my opinion about meat i think first the most important thing is to say that we don 't have maybe we can have some middle ground for that but i will continue to consider and i will report back maybe next year but that is my given name and an activist i 'm also a professional i 'm you know whenever they want to do a diversity i think really i can 't talk about race without remembering that it is a construct you know until we redress the wrongs of the going to be turned around i don 't care if the present is the new future if anything i 've said today makes you feel uncomfortable you 're welcome if you don 't love yourself inside i would just like to say as an african woman that i believe the diet that we need is really to remove the crazy belief that there is anything wrong with a nice backside no i am teasing about that women celebrate your body for god 's sake stop running around starving you are making yourselves and talking about what 's the most popular diet i 'm gonna start off by telling y 'all that this is my first time here at ted i might but i made sarah jones promise she gonna bring me but you know i just want to say there 's a lot of things more important than counting calories and getting to come here hear y 'all ideas worth spreading that where you sit you create everything that 's gonna come for and for me i think homeless is the wrong word for it anyway you know but that just makes me houseless i have me a home you do too find it and try to find yourself in there make sure you know it 's not just about virtual that 's wonderful but it 's also about the actual reality here on earth how are people living today how can you be part of the solution thank y 'all for thinking about that right now in the present moment to influence the future i appreciate"
