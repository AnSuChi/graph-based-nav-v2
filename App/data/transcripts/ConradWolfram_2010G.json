  "transcript": "those learning it those trying to employ them think they don 't know enough yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history so at one end we 've got falling interest in education in math and at the other end we 've got a more mathematical world so what 's the problem why has this well actually i think the answer is staring us right in the face use computers i believe that correctly using computers let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education see in the real world math but in education it looks very different dumbed down problems lots except if you 're learning it and math sometimes looks like math like in this example here and sometimes it doesn 't like am i drunk you wouldn 't have expected that a few years back but now you can find out all about unfortunately my weight is a little higher than that but so let 's zoom out a bit and ask why are we teaching people math what 's the point of teaching people math well i think there are about three what i call everyday living to function in the world today you 've got to be pretty quantitative much more so than a few years ago figure out your mortgages being skeptical of government statistics those kinds of things and thirdly what i would call like logical mind training logical thinking what is math what do we mean when we say we 're doing math or educating people to do math well i think it 's about four steps roughly speaking starting with posing the right question what is it that we want to ask what is it we 're trying to find out here and this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world beyond virtually any other part of doing math people ask the wrong question and surprisingly enough they get the wrong answer for that reason if not for others once you 've done that then there 's the computation step turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form and of course math is very powerful at doing that did it answer the question and also verify it crucial step now here 's the crazy thing right now in math education we 're spending about perhaps eighty percent of the time teaching people to do yet that 's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice instead we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one two and four conceptualizing problems applying them getting the teacher to run them through how to do that see crucial point here math is not equal to calculating math is a much broader subject than calculating but in the last few decades that has totally changed we 've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that i could ever imagine with computers calculating was typically the limiting step and now often it isn 't it 's the thing you 'd like to avoid if you can like to get a machine to do it 's a means to an end not an end in itself and automation allows us to have that machinery computers allow us to do that and this is not a small problem by any means i estimated that just today across the world we spent about one hundred and six average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand that 's an amazing amount of human endeavor so we better be damn sure and by the way 't even have fun doing it most of them so we better be damn sure that we know why we 're doing that and it has a real purpose i think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that and i think there are some cases for example mental arithmetic i still do a lot think about it roughly it 's still quicker to do that and more practical so i think practicality is one case where it 's worth teaching people and then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating but i think they 're relatively small in number one thing i often ask about is ancient greek and how this relates see the thing we 're doing right we 're forcing people to learn mathematics it 's a major subject i 'm not for one minute suggesting that if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre they should do that that 's absolutely the right thing for people to follow their self interest so i have this distinction between what we 're making people do and the well one of them is they say you need to get the basics first you shouldn 't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject so my usual question is what do you mean by basics basics of i don 't think so i think you need to separate the basics of what you 're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation a hundred years ago it 's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things but automation in cars allowed that to separate so driving is now a quite separate subject so to speak from engineering of the car so automation allows this separation and also allows in the case of driving and i believe also in the future case of maths a democratized way of so there 's another thing that comes up with basics people confuse in my view the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching so just because paper was invented before computers it doesn 't necessarily mean you get more to the basics using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics she enjoys making what she calls paper laptops so i asked her one day you know when i was your age i didn 't make these why do you think that was and after a second or two carefully reflecting she said so another one that comes up is computers dumb math down it 's all intellectual this one kind of do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don 't really understand for reasons they don 't get when they 're out of education they do it on a computer just to be clear i think computers can really help with this problem actually make it more conceptual of course like any great tool they can be used completely mindlessly like turning everything into a multimedia show let me show you that but you can make it a quartic equation make it kind of harder same principles applied calculations and problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this they 've got hair all over them they 're not just simple dumbed down things that we see in school math and think of the outside world do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things so the problem we 've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down but that we have dumbed down problems right now well another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding so if you go through lots of examples you can get the answer you can understand how the basics of the system work better i think there is one thing that i think very valid here which is that i think understanding procedures and processes is important but there 's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world it 's called programming programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days and it 's also a great way to engage students much more so to be clear what i really but i think we can do both at the same time here and you can do so many more problems what i really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in feel it we want people who can feel the math instinctively that 's what computers allow us to do another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum traditionally it 's been by how difficult it is to calculate but actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group this was an example i built for my daughter and very very simple we were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number and of course it turns into a circle and by the way she was also very insistent on being able to change the color an important feature you can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things very simple example that 's a view of the world that we don 't usually give people for many many years after this so one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward it 's kind of hard to to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the during the semesters and then we can ask questions real questions questions like what 's the best life insurance policy to get real questions that people have in their everyday lives and how many years of protection do i need what does that do to the payments but i think it 's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical got to make sure that we can move our economies forward this isn 't some optional extra and the country that does this first will my view leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even an improved economy an improved outlook in fact i even talk about us moving from what we often call now the knowledge economy to what we might call a computational knowledge economy where high level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is we can engage so many more students with this and let 's understand this is not an incremental sort of change we 're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real world math and you know if you walk across a chasm you end up making it worse than if you didn 't start at all bigger disaster no what i 'm suggesting is that we should leap off we and we should leap off one side and go the other of course having calculated our differential equation very carefully changed math curriculum built from the ground up based on computers being there computers that are now ubiquitous almost calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years but what i am sure is it 's the mainstream subject of the future let 's have a bit of fun for us for the students and for ted here"
