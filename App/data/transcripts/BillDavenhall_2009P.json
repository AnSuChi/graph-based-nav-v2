  "transcript": "can geographic information make you healthy in two thousand and one i got hit by a train my train was a heart attack i found myself in a hospital in an i started asking my questions well why me why now why here could my doctor have warned me so what i want to do here in the few minutes i have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health genetics lifestyle and and if we manage those risks we 're going to live a good life and a good healthy life i understand the genetics and lifestyle part and you know why i understand that because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this i mean if you 're lucky enough you get to do it more than once right but this part of the equation i didn 't really get and i don 't think my physicians really get this part of the equation well it can mean a lot of things this is my life just think about that you know wander through your your life thinking about this and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places you spend it at rest and you spend it at work and if you 're like me you 're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place so it 's not really simple when somebody asks you where and where do you expose yourselves to risks seventy five percent of my time and i don 't wander far from that place for a majority of my time even though i 'm an extensive global trekker now i 'm going to take you on a little journey here i started off in scranton pennsylvania i don 't know if anybody might hail from but this is where i spent my first nineteen years with my little young lungs you know breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and methane gas smoldering coal waste look like so then i decided to leave that part of the and i was going to go to the breathing various concentrations of that and on a clear day it always looked like you never saw it it was insidious and it was really happening carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone no doctor can i remember ever asking me where have you lived they haven 't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i look at the kind of data that 's available this data 's from all over the world countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research now i 've circled the places where i 've been well by design if i wanted to have a heart attack i 'd been in the right places how many have spent it in the red places oh not so lucky there are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the and it 's not in yours either so here 's my friend paul he 's a colleague and you can see he 's if you really studied that you you might have some clues as to what paul likes to do anybody got any clues and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the the epa did you know that data existed for every community in the united states you could have your own personalized map of that so our cell phones can now build a place history this is how paul did it he did it with his iphone this might be what we end up with this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room i suggest that maybe you not decide just because you 're out here in beautiful california and it 's warm every day because of this report what i 'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions okay number one is we must teach physicians about the value of geographical of the world the importance of some of the information i 've shared here with you today it not only will be important for the physician it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon but it will also be useful for us i could have made the decision if i had this information not to move to the ozone capital of the united states couldn 't i i could make that decision or i could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best of myself and my company"
