  "transcript": "was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at yale university in the department of medicine and my job was to write many of the algorithms and code for nasa to do virtual surgery in preparation for the astronauts going into one of the fascinating things about what we were working on is that we were seeing using new scanning technologies things that had never been seen before not only in disease management but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you marvel i remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen your entire body everything your hair skin bone nails everything is made of collagen and it 's a kind of rope like structure that it so perfectly organized a structure it was hard not to attribute divinity to it because we kept on seeing this one of the opportunities i had was one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the nih and what we were going to do was scan so i wrote the and code and he built the hardware paul lauterbur and i 'm going to show you a sample of the piece from conception to birth the the the the the the the the the and as we kept on scanning more and more working on this project looking at these two simple cells that have this unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you looking at small clusters of the body these little pieces of tissue that were the trophoblasts coming off of the blastocyst all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus saying plant me building this incredible trilinear fetus something that you can recognize and then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being the marvel of this information how do we actually have this biological mechanism i 'm going to show you something pretty unique itself within five weeks you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles six weeks these folds are now beginning with the papilla on the inside of the heart actually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart until you get a mature heart and then basically the development of the entire human body the magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure saying exactly where that nerve cell should go complexity of these the mathematical models of how these things are indeed done are beyond human comprehension even though i am a mathematician i look at this with marvel of how do these instruction sets then you start to take a look at adult life take a look at this little tuft of capillaries it 's just a tiny sub substructure microscopic but basically by the time you 're nine you have almost sixty thousand miles of vessels inside your body and only one mile is visible fifty nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine miles that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away the complexity of building that within a single system is again beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today so as you actually watch the baby 's brain grow and this is one of the things we 're doing we 're launching two new studies of scanning babies ' brains from the moment they 're born every six months until they 're six years old we 're going to be doing about two hundred and fifty children and it 's not just our own existence but how does the woman 's body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological cardiovascular thank you"
