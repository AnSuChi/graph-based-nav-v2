  "transcript": "past statues at last soaring domes choirs of angels we don 't really have any of that there you may ask yourself what do we have well curtains up on the churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses but as a way to represent the great theater of life the human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story now this building started out as they elected their pope there five hundred years ago it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave so you may ask how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history now moving from the beginning of a few elite and eventually able to speak to audiences the first one was rather limited in scope it reflected the rather parochial perspective the second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after columbus 's historical the original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world there were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of jesus and moses reflecting the development of the jewish and christian people the man who commissioned this pope men like sandro botticelli and the man who would become michelangelo 's future painting teacher ghirlandaio and in these stories you 'll notice familiar landscapes the artists using roman monuments or a tuscan landscape to render a faraway story something much more familiar with the addition of images but in 46 foot microcosm had to expand as well and it did thanks to a creative genius a visionary and an awesome story now the creative genius was michelangelo buonarroti thirty three years old when he was tapped to decorate twelve thousand square feet of ceiling and the deck was stacked against him he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture and that project had fallen through but genius rose to the challenge in an age when a man dared to sail across the atlantic ocean michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters would tell a story no apostles but a story of great beginnings the story of genesis but michelangelo wasn 't really a painter and so he played to his strengths instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within michelangelo was this plan was embraced by the larger than life pope julius ii a man who was unafraid of michelangelo 's brazen genius he was nephew to pope he left us the raphael rooms the sistine chapel he left st peter 's basilica as well as an extraordinary collection and he was right the encounter between these two giants michelangelo and julius ii that 's michelangelo was so committed to this project that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years using a skeleton crew no more familiar artistic references to the world around you there 's just space and structure and energy a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels and we stand in the far end by the entrance far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance looking for a beginning and whether in scientific inquiry or in or in biblical tradition we think in terms of a primal spark michelangelo gave us an initial energy when a churning figure blurry in the distance compressed into a tight space vegetation and then the movement stops in poetry and the creator hovers so what 's he doing is he creating land is he creating sea or is he looking back over his handiwork the universe and his treasures just like michelangelo must have looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming it is good and you get to the culmination of creation which is man a light figure against a dark background but looking closer that leg is pretty languid on the ground arm is heavy on the knee adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness that spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger which is one millimeter from the hand of adam it puts us at the edge of our seats because we 're one moment from that contact and then michelangelo threw a curveball who is in that other arm first woman no she 's not an afterthought she 's part of the plan she 's always been in his mind look at her so intimate with god that her hand curls around his arm and for me an american art historian from the because i realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women so much so that the dead center the heart of the ceiling is the creation of woman not adam the remaining scenes in the ceiling they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us you have noah and his ark and the flood you have noah he 's making a sacrifice and a covenant with god maybe he 's it is a curious way to design the ceiling now starting out with god creating life ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn but he 's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath noah emerald topaz scarlet on the prophet you this is the most important juncture past meets present this figure jonah who spent three days in the belly of the whale for the christians is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through jesus ' sacrifice but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality all of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall where we see michelangelo 's last judgment painted in one thousand five hundred and thirty four after the world had the reformation had splintered the church the ottoman empire had made islam a household word and magellan had found a route into the pacific ocean how is a artist who has never been any further than venice going to speak to this new world michelangelo chose to paint destiny common to all of us to leave a legacy told in terms of the christian vision of the last judgment the end of the world michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies unique like each and every one of us struggling and trying to rise the lion 's share of the space goes to the winner 's circle there you find men and women completely nude overcome obstacles they 're just like athletes so you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight and as michelangelo proved in his painting hardship setbacks and obstacles they don they forge it this does lead us to one odd thing and so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude he borrowed from julius ii 's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength now and so it did michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press complaints about the nudity spread all over the place and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography at which point he added two more portraits one of the man who criticized him a papal courtier and the other one of himself as a dried up husk no athlete in the hands of a long suffering martyr the year he died he saw several of these figures covered over a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory and so now we stand in the here and now we are caught in that space between beginnings and endings in the great huge totality of the human experience the sistine chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror who am i in this picture am i one of the crowd am i the drunk and as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty we are inspired to ask ourselves life 's biggest questions who am i thank you but actually the story is bigger it 's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures this work of art was almost destroyed because of that it was something that happened over the space of twenty years of editorials and complaints saying to the church you can 't possibly tell us how to live our lives did you notice you have pornography in the pope 's chapel and so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed it was finally the year that michelangelo died that the church finally found a compromise a way to save the painting and that was in putting up these extra thirty covers and that happens to be the origin of fig leafing that 's where it all came about and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art not indeed deface or destroyed it bg this what you just gave us is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the sistine chapel art today and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just think it 's really nice to be able to pause and look but also realize even when you 're in those days thousand people a day even those days when you 're in there with all those other people look around you and think how amazing it is that some painted plaster from five hundred years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you looking upwards with their jaws dropped it 's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space"
