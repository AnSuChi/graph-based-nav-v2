  "transcript": "i want to tell you three stories sometimes it seems like all these problems of so i want to tell you about someone like this that i know i 'm going to call her ella the shops are closed the pub 's gone the playground 's pretty desolate and never used and inside ella 's house the tension is palpable and the noise levels are deafening the tv 's on at full volume one of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters another son ryan is keeping up this constant stream of abuse from the kitchen and the dogs are locked behind the bedroom door and straining ella is stuck she has lived with crisis for forty years she knows nothing else and she knows no way out one of her children has been taken into care by social services the three children that still live with her and ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle of her own mother 's life before her but when i met ella there were seventy three different services on offer for her and her family in the city where she lives seventy three different services run out of twenty four departments in one city and ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them they think nothing of calling social services and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out youth workers a health officer a housing officer a home tutor struggling to break the cycle social and environmental deprivation none of these well meaning visitors are making a difference this is a chart we made in the same city with another family this shows thirty years of intervention in that family 's life and just as with ella not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan there 's no end goal in sight none of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues these are just containment measures ways of managing a problem one of the policemen says to me look i just deliver the message and then i leave so i 've spent time living with families like ella 's in different parts of the world because i want to know what can we learn from places where our social institutions just aren 't working i want to know what it feels like to live in ella 's family i want to know what 's going on and what we can do differently first thing i learned is that cost is a really slippery concept because when the government says that a family like ella 's costs a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage what it really means is that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year instead the system is just like this costly gyroscope that spins around the families keeping them stuck at its heart exactly where they are so tom who is the social worker for meetings with colleagues filling out forms more meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms and maybe most shockingly the fourteen time he has to be with ryan is spent getting data and information for the system so he says to ryan how often have you been smoking have you been drinking when did you go to school it rules out the possibility of what 's needed to build a relationship between tom and ryan so many hours and there was this moment of absolute breakdown and then of clarity we had to work in a different way so in a really brave step the leaders of the city where ella lives agreed that we could start by reversing ryan 's ratio so everyone who came into contact with ella or a family like ella 's would spend eighty percent of their time working with the families and so ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel to choose from amongst the existing professionals who would work with them and many many people wanted to join us because you don 't go into this kind of work to manage a system you go in because you can and you want to make a difference and the mother asked everybody who came through the door what will you do when my son starts kicking me and so the first person who comes in says well and if the noise is still going on i 'll call my supervisor and the mothers go you 're the system get out of here and then the next person who comes is a policeman tackle your son to the ground and then i 'm not sure what i 'll do and the mothers say thank you so they chose professionals who confessed they didn 't necessarily have the answers who said well they weren 't going to talk in jargon they showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin even though they wouldn 't be soft with them so these new teams and the families were then given a and so one of the families went out for supper they went to mcdonald 's and they sat down and they talked and they listened for the first time in a long time another family asked the team if they would help them and in a really short space of time something new started to grow a relationship between the team and the workers and then some remarkable changes took place but today and the neighbors who previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere except next door to them are fine they 've made some new friendships and all the same people have been involved in this transformation but today our relationships are all but written off by our our social policies our welfare institutions and i 've learned that this really has to change so what do i mean by relationships i 'm talking about the simple human bonds between us a kind of authentic sense of connection of belonging the bonds that make us happy that support us to change to be brave like ella and try something new and you know it 's no accident that those who run and work in the institutions supposed to support ella and her family don 't talk about relationships the contemporaries of william beveridge who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the beveridge report had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man instead they trusted this idea of the impersonal system and the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system beveridge the beveridge report sold over one hundred thousand copies in the first weeks of publication alone and it had this huge impact on the way that welfare states were designed around the globe cultures the bureaucracies the institutions and i think it 's really important to say that in the 20th century they were remarkably successful these institutions they led to longer lifespans the eradication of mass disease mass housing almost universal education according to government statistics one person over sixty one in three doesn 't speak to or see another person in a week and so the services that beveridge designed and exported they can 't address and it can 't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response i started to work with a group of about sixty older people in south london where i live but mainly i was just observing and and if you ask them people tell you they want two things they want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb or to be there when they come out of hospital they want on demand practical support so we rented a phone hired a couple of handymen and started a service we called circle and circle offers its local membership a toll free zero eight hundred number that they can call on demand for any support and people have called us for so many reasons they 've called because their pets are unwell their dvd is broken they 've forgotten how to use their mobile phone or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there and circle also offers a rich social calendar knitting museum tours hot air ballooning you name it and she was going into hospital for a hip operation so she called her local circle to say they wouldn 't see her for a bit and damon who runs the local circle calls her back and says how can i help jocelyn is doing the shopping tony 's doing the gardening melissa and joe are going to come in and cook and chat although she says that she feels twenty five inside but she also says that she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined circle but the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event led to a process where natural friendships formed friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services so i think that three factors have converged that enable us to put relationships at the heart and center of how we solve social problems secondly the cost human as much as financial of doing business as usual and thirdly technology i 've talked about the first two factors it 's technology that enables these approaches to scale and potentially now support thousands of people so the technology we 've used is really simple it 's made up of available things like databases mobile phones circle has got this very simple system that underpins it enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand the beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources managing access in my work at the front line i 've seen again and again how up to eighty percent of resource is spent keeping people out so professionals have to administer these increasingly complex forms of administration that are basically about stopping people accessing the service and circle like the relational services that we and others have designed inverts this logic what it so i want to tell you my third and final story which is about unemployment our welfare states were primarily designed to but here systems are failing and so the response has been to try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional to speed up processing times divide people into ever smaller categories try and target services at them more efficiently the very opposite of relational but guess how most people find work today and it 's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work but not surprisingly people who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network are those who are most isolated from it so knowing this and also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems we designed something new with relationships at its heart we designed a service that encourages people to meet up people in and out of work to work together in structured ways and try new it 's very hard to compare the results of these new systems with the old transactional models but it looks like with our first one thousand members we outperformed existing services by a factor of three at a fraction of the cost but not to network people in the way that a social platform would do we 've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other building real relationships and supporting people to find work and in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake he had left people and their communities out and this omission he said led to seeing people and people starting to see themselves within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions we need to bring people and their communities back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services in an approach that i call relational we need to leave behind these old transactional unsuitable outdated models and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses that can support a family like ella 's that can address an issue like loneliness that can support people into work and up the skills curve in a modern labor market that can also address challenges of education of health care systems and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies"
