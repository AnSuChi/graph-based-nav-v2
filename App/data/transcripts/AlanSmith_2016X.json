  "transcript": "and they were shocked to find out that for every one hundred working age adults in the country forty seven of them lacked level one numeracy skills now level one numeracy skills that 's percentages and decimals so this figure prompted a lot of hand wringing in so can you guess what happened to this number it went up to forty nine and in fact when i reported this figure in the ft one of our readers joked and said this figure is only shocking to fifty one percent of the population the reaction of a schoolchild when i presented at a school this information raised their hand and said how do we know that the person who made that number isn 't one of the forty nine percent either so clearly there 's a numeracy issue because these are important skills for life and a lot of the changes that we want to introduce oecd this year released some figures looking at numeracy in young people the usa nearly forty percent of young people in the us have low numeracy now england is there too but there are seven oecd countries with figures above twenty percent that is a problem because it doesn 't have to be that way if you look at the far end of this graph you can see the netherlands and korea are in single figures so there 's definitely a numeracy problem that we want to address now useful as studies like these are i think we risk herding people inadvertently into one of two categories that there are two kinds of people and the people who can i 'm trying to talk about here today is to say that i believe that that and that that should be the starting point to the journey ahead and one of the ways in which we can begin that journey for me is looking at statistics now i am the first to acknowledge that statistics has got somewhat of an image problem laughter it 's the part of mathematics that even mathematicians don 't particularly like because whereas the rest of but actually if you 'd asked my undergraduate professors what two and yet here i am about to show you some statistical graphics that i programmed if you look at the etymology of the word statistics it 's the science of dealing with data about the state or the community that we live in so statistics are about us as a group not us as individuals and i think as social animals we share this fascination about how we as individuals relate to our groups to our peers and statistics in this way are at their most powerful when they surprise us and there 's been some really wonderful surveys carried out recently by ipsos mori in the last few years how many of them are muslim now the average answer from this survey which was supposed to be representative of the total population was that 's what people thought british people think twenty four out of every one hundred people in the country are muslim now official figures and the reality as as given by statistics and i think that 's interesting what could possibly be causing that misperception and i said how many teenage girls do you think the british public think get pregnant every year and the girls were apoplectic when i said because in fact i 'd have to have closer to two hundred dots before i could color one in in terms of what the official figures tell us and rather ipsos mori expanded the survey in recent years and the average answer from the saudis was just over a quarter that 's what they thought just over a quarter of it 's nearer to three quarters and i love this one they asked in japan they asked the japanese for every one hundred japanese people how many of them live in rural areas the average was about a 50 50 split just over the official figure is seven so extraordinary variations and surprising to some but not surprising to people who have read the work of daniel kahneman for example the amos tversky spent years researching this disjoint between what people perceive and the reality the fact that people are actually pretty poor intuitive statisticians and there are many reasons for this individual experiences certainly can influence our perceptions but so too can things like the media reporting things by exception rather than what 's normal kahneman had a nice way of referring to that he said we can be blind to the obvious so we 've got the numbers wrong but we can be blind to our blindness about it and that has enormous repercussions for decision making so at the statistics office while this was all going on i thought this was really interesting i said this is clearly a global problem but maybe geography is the issue here so in this case it 's sixty four million people not very well it turns out i can 't do that so i had an idea which was to think about this same sort of approach but to think about it in a very local sense it 's a simple web app you put in a post code and then it will ask you questions based on census data for your local and i was very conscious in designing this i wanted to make it open to the widest possible range of people not just the forty nine percent who can get the numbers i wanted everyone to engage with it so for the design of the quiz i was inspired by the isotypes of otto neurath from the 1920s and ' 30s now these are methods for representing numbers using repeating the numbers are there but they sit in the background so it 's a great way of representing quantity without resorting to using terms like percentage fractions and ratios so left hand side there and a map showing you the area we 're asking you questions about on the right hand side there are seven questions each question there 's a possible answer between zero and a hundred and at the end of the quiz you get an overall score between zero and a hundred and so because this is i thought we would have a quick look at the quiz for the first few questions i don 't know exeter very well at all so i had a guess at this but it gives you an idea of how this quiz you drag the slider how about the next question this is asking about what the average age is so the age at which half the population are younger and half the population are older and i thought in exeter it 's incredibly young and i had underestimated the impact of the university so this one 's now asking about homeownership and i hedged my bets here because i didn 't want to be more than fifty out on the answer these get harder these questions because when you 're in an area when you 're in a community things like age there are clues to whether a population is old or young just by looking around the area you can see it something like homeownership is much more difficult to see so we revert to our own heuristics our own biases about how many people we think own their own homes the census data that it 's based on was already a few years old we 've had so in some senses this was all a little bit old and and not necessarily new but i was interested to see gamifying the data in the way that we have by using animation and playing on the fact that people have their own preconceptions the reaction was um was more than i could have hoped for it was a long held ambition of mine to bring down a statistics website due to public demand laughter this url contains the words statistics gov and uk which are three of people 's least favorite words in a and the amazing thing about this was that the website came down at quarter to ten at night because people were actually engaging with this data of their own free will using their own personal time i was very interested to see that we got something like a quarter of a million people playing the quiz within the space of forty eight hours of launching it and it sparked an enormous on social media which was largely dominated by people having fun with their misconceptions which is something that i how well do you know the area you claim to represent and then just to finish the national john pullinger you would expect he would be pretty good he got forty four for his own area jeremy paxman it just shows you that the numbers can inspire and that 's why we should be fascinated by numbers thank you very much"
