  "transcript": "i 'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you in just fifteen minutes that this isn 't a flimsy idea or a but a powerful cultural and economic force now i 'm going to start with a deceptively simple example but you can 't quite bring yourself to throw away can 't see all the hands but it looks like all of you right on our shelves at home we have a box set of the dvd series twenty four season six to be precise i think it was bought for us around three years ago for a christmas present so there it sits on our shelves obsolete to us but with immediate and i am a big fan of sex and the city so how easily could i swap our unwanted copy of twenty four for a wanted sex and the city now you may have noticed there 's a new sector emerging called swap trading now the easiest analogy for swap trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media what it does is use the internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person a 's haves with person c 's wants whatever they may be i went so in other words what 's happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company 's sugar rush problem a problem the economists call the coincidence of wants in approximately sixty seconds what 's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot because it knows the way of the item but that 's not my interest and nor is swap trading per se my passion and what i 've spent the last few years dedicated to researching behaviors and inherent in these systems that i would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name i didn 't know yet ninety nine percent of trades on swaptree happen successfully and the one percent that receive a negative rating so what 's happening here an extremely powerful dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural we now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before so what 's actually happening is that social networks and real time technologies are taking us back we 're bartering trading swapping sharing but they 're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms what i find fascinating is that we 've actually wired our world to share and that 's creating an economy of what 's mine is yours the grandfather of exchange marketplaces to car sharing companies such as goget where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour to social lending platforms such as zopa that will take anyone in this audience with one hundred dollars to lend and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world i call this groundswell collaborative consumption now before i dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption which is where did this idea come from now i 'd like to say i woke up one morning and said i 'm going to write about collaborative consumption but actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas over the next minute you 're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head the first thing i began to notice how many big concepts were emerging from the and linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world from the election of a president to the infamous wikipedia and everything in between on what the power of numbers could achieve now you know when you learn a new and then you start to see that word everywhere that 's what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators to highly enabled collaborators what 's happening is the internet is removing the middleman peer to peer and we were doing so for thousands of years or farmed in cooperatives before this big system called hyper consumption came along but things are changing and one of the reasons why is the digital natives or gen y so we the millennials i am just a millennial are like foot soldiers moving us from a culture of me to a culture of we we now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone anytime in real time from a small device in our hands all of this was going through my head towards the end of two thousand and eight and he poignantly commented that two thousand and eight is when we hit a wall when mother nature and the market both said no more now we rationally know that an economy built on so all of this is a lot of twittering right well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head until actually i realized it was happening because of four key drivers one a renewed belief in the importance of community and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means a torrent of peer to peer fundamentally changing the way we behave three pressing unresolved environmental concerns and four a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors these four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift away from the 're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors through sites such as flickr and twitter that are becoming second nature online are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives from morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food we are consuming and collaborating once again when we dived into them we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems just like swaptree are when you take a used or and move it from where it 's not needed to somewhere or someone where it is this is the sharing of resources of things like money skills and time i bet in a couple of are going to become a part of everyday vernacular one of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles it 's a scheme in the u k that matches mr jones with some spare space in his back garden with mrs smith a would be grower together they grow their own food 's one of those ideas that 's so simple yet brilliant you wonder why it 's never been done before now the third system is product service systems this is where you pay for the benefit of the product what it does for you without needing to own the product outright and that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to how many of you have a power drill own a power that power drill will be used around twelve to thirteen minutes in its in its entire lifetime it 's kind of ridiculous right because what you need is the hole not the drill so why don 't you rent the drill or even better rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it these three systems are coming together i 'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit so the average car so this is where car sharing companies such as zipcar and goget come in in two thousand and nine zipcar took two hundred and fifty participants from across thirteen cities and to surrender their keys for a month it 's amazing that four hundred and thirteen lbs were lost just from the but my favorite statistic is that one hundred out of the two hundred and fifty participants did not want their keys back the car addicts had lost their urge to own now products service systems have been around for years just think of libraries and laundrettes but i think they 're entering a new age because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun there 's a great quote that was written in the new york times that said sharing is to ownership what the ipod is to the 8 track what solar solar power is to the coal mine i believe also our generation i don 't want the dvd i don 't want stuff i want the needs or experiences it fulfills this is fueling a massive shift from where usage trumps possessions or as kevin kelly the editor of wired magazine puts it where access is better than ownership now as our possessions dematerialize into the cloud a blurry and what 's ours i want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening this represents an eight year time span we 've gone from traditional car ownership to car sharing companies such as zipcar and goget to platforms that match rides to the newest entry which is peer to peer car rental where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for twenty three hours a day to your neighbor now all of these systems require a degree of trust and the cornerstone to this working is reputation now in the old consumer system our reputation didn 't matter so much because our credit history was far more important that any kind of but now with the web we leave a trail with every spammer we flag with every idea we post comment we share we 're actually signaling how well we collaborate and whether we can or can 't be trusted i can see that rondoron has completed five hundred and fifty three trades with a one hundred percent it 's only a matter of time before we 're going to be able to perform a google like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital and this reputation capital will determine our access i believe we 're actually in a period where we 're waking up i believe it will be referred to as a revolution to speak made a seismic shift from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good i 'm on a mission to make sharing hip because i really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business hyper consumption and teach us when enough really is enough thank you very much"
