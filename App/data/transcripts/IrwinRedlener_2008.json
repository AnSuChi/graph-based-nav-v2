  "transcript": "a big question that we 're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now are we at risk of a nuclear attack now there 's a bigger question that 's probably actually more the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility until this very moment we 've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that 's characterized by two phases which i 'm going to go through with you right now united states had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the manhattan project and the idea was very straightforward we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending world war ii that we 'd been involved in in europe and in the pacific we were the only nuclear power we had a few nuclear weapons two of which we dropped on japan in hiroshima a few days later in nagasaki in august we were the only nuclear power on earth and they began to match what the united states was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s so by each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads the world had thousand nuclear warheads and seven members of something that came to be known as the and it was an extraordinary time and i am going to go through some of the mentality that we that americans and the rest of the world were experiencing but i want to just point out to you that ninety five percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since one thousand nine hundred and eighty five going forward of course were part of the arsenals of the and before the break up of the soviet union we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view we began to and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of twenty one thousand it 's a very difficult number to deal with because they 're still probably usable they could be re commissioned but the way they count things which is very complicated so we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world but a very different set of circumstances so i 'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters chapter one is point and through those years was a superpowers ' nuclear arms race it was characterized by a and basically we lived for all those years and some might argue that we still do in a situation of being on the brink 's incredible that we actually lived through all that we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym which is mad it stands for mutually assured destruction so it meant if we would attack you virtually simultaneously and the end result would be a destruction of your country and so the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you that 's the way we lived and the danger of that of course is that a misreading there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration we engaged in america in a so what we what we offered ourselves was a collection of things i 'm just going to go skim through a few things just to jog your memories if you 're born after one thousand nine hundred and fifty this is just consider this entertainment otherwise it 's memory lane this was bert the and if you get under your desk things would be ok i didn 't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school but i was interested and i think this was seriously delusional we told people to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter would be a study when we weren 't having an atomic war or you could use it as a tv room or as many teenagers found out a very very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend and actually so there are multiple uses of the of the bomb shelters or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground now less than two percent about one point four percent either making a space in their basement or actually building a bomb shelter many buildings public buildings around the country this is new york city had these little civil defense signs and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters from the nuclear weaponry and one of the greatest and are well aware of their behaviors from katrina here is their first big public there were about six volumes written on this a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the united states having three to four days warning and i 'm telling you i actually testified at the senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate and actually have three or four days turns out that they had another idea but take out sites where people were it turns out was behind all this it was just the main point here is we were dealing with all out nuclear war so organizations like physicians for social and they 'd say here 's a map of your city here 's what 's going to happen if we and what happened was when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear when the soviet union broke up instead although the scenario has changed very considerably the fact is that we haven 't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means so i 'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second so what is a nuclear terror threat and there 's four key ingredients to first thing is that the global nuclear weapons in the stockpiles that i showed you in those original maps happen to be not uniformly secure and it 's particularly not secure there are many many sites where warheads are stored lots of sites where fissionable materials like highly enriched uranium and plutonium are absolutely not safe they 're two thousand and six the international atomic energy agency documented one hundred and seventy five cases of nuclear theft the key ingredients to make the global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about one thousand three hundred at the low end to about two thousand one hundred metric more than one hundred megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure russian facilities so what i 'd like to show you is this is not a product placement it 's just if i was coca cola i 'd be pretty distressed about this this is what you would need to steal or buy 100 metric ton stockpile that 's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb that you 'd need ten to thirteen pounds of plutonium now plutonium ten to thirteen pounds this this is enough plutonium to create a now this situation already i you know i don 't really like thinking about this although somehow i got myself a job where i have to think about it so the point is that we 're very very insecure in terms of developing this material the second thing is what about the know how and there 's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know how to actually there 's a lot of know how out there there 's an unbelievable amount of know how if you have an undergraduate degree in physics i would suggest although i don 't so maybe it 's not even true but something close to that would allow you with the information that 's currently well what we 're seeing now is a level of terrorism they are what 's the response and to whom is the response and they 're retaliation proof since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work here is sulaiman abu ghaith he wrote many many times statements to this effect we have the right to kill four million americans two million of whom should be children 1990s was a good example of homegrown the fourth element is that the this would be a talk for another day but the level of the preparedness that the united states has achieved since nine eleven of ' one is unbelievably inadequate what you saw after katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the united states is for any kind of major attack seven million ship cargo containers come into the united states every year five to seven percent only are inspected this is alexander lebed who was a general that worked with yeltsin who talked about and presented to congress this idea that the russians had developed these suitcase bombs they were very low and lebed came to the united states you put the elements into a suitcase it becomes very portable the suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car you take it wherever you want to take it and you can detonate it and you happen to get one of those insecure you go down to your local rent a truck and for fifty bucks or so you put it in the truck and you 're ready to go it could happen but what it would mean and but anybody who dismisses the thought i think there 's a lot of people in the intelligence community a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it 's unless we do certain things to to really try to defuse the risk like better interdiction better prevention better fixing you know better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities although even that is not completely off the table there 's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers other places where while initially locally and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here in the financial district and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information i think news you could use kind of concept here so first of all this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine this is the ultimate if you 're right where the bomb and that 's i 'm just telling you this is not good you assume that two mile radius you have a fifty percent chance of being killed and up to about eight miles away now i 'm talking about killed instantly somewhere between a ten and twenty percent tens of millions of degrees fahrenheit at the core here where it goes off and acute radiation and blast effects and destruction of buildings almost totally within this so it was a moot point if you 've survived the initial blast you have when the blast goes off and by the way if it ever comes up don 't look at it either temporarily or permanently so if there 's any way that you can avoid like avert your eyes that would be a good thing but you 're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon you have that 's gone off you have ten to twenty minutes depending on the size and exactly where it went off to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the from the mushroom cloud that goes up in that ten to fifteen minutes all you have to do and i mean this seriously is go about a mile it comes straight lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds and it 's mostly in this particular direction it 's going and if you 're in this vicinity you 've got to get away so you 're feeling the wind and there 's tremendous wind now that you 're going to be feeling and you want to go perpendicular to the wind [ not upwind or downwind ] if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you you 've got to get out of there if you don 't get out of there you 're going to be exposed to lethal radiation we want you to go into a shelter and stay there now shelter in an urban area means you which it would be higher than the ninth floor so you have to be tenth floor or higher or in the basement but basically you 've got to get out of town as quickly as possible if you do that you actually can survive a nuclear again going with the wind and settling down for another fifteen or twenty miles out in this case and it could mean the difference between one hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand fatalities from something like this and half a million to seven hundred thousand fatalities but in two thousand and eight there isn 't one single american city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster you say nuclear and they 're thinking oh my god we 're all gone what 's the point it 's futile and i just want to leave you with the personal points that i think you might be interested in the key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out and not going into harm 's way and the farther you are away in distance the longer it is in time from the initial blast and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere the better so separation hopefully with dirt or concrete or being in a basement distance and time is what will save you so here 's what you do theoretically you want to do that you want to keep your mouth open so your eardrums don 't burst from the from the pressures if you 're very close to what happened you actually do have to duck and cover like bert told you bert the turtle and shelter and place then you know that it was over there the blast and you 're going this way once you 're out and evacuating you want to keep as much of your skin your mouth and nose covered as long as that covering doesn 't impede you moving and getting out of there and finally you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible and if you 're wearing clothing you 've taken off your clothing you 're going to get showered down some place and and remove the radiation that would be but you 're going to wait hopefully you 'll have your little and you 'll be waiting for people to tell you when it 's safe to go outside that 's what you need to do in conclusion nuclear war is less likely than before but by no means out of the question and it 's not survivable nuclear terrorism is possible it may be probable but is survivable and this is jack geiger who 's one of the heroes i urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable inhumane reality of nuclear weapons"
