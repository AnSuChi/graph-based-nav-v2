  "transcript": "some of you may be in college right now and you 're feeling this excitement at this very moment but all in all it 's a pretty good path young people emerge from college with pride and with great friends and with a lot of knowledge today i want to talk about the second institution overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the united states and that institution is prison young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers instead but with criminal records this institution is also costing us a lot about forty thousand dollars a year to send a young person to prison in new jersey but here taxpayers are footing the bill bill and what kids are getting is a cold prison cell and a permanent mark against them when they come home and apply for work there are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood than ever before in the united states and that 's because in the past forty years our incarceration rate by seven hundred percent i have one slide for this talk here it is here 's our incarceration rate about seven hundred and sixteen people per one hundred thousand in the population here 's the oecd countries what 's more it 's poor kids that we 're sending to prison too many drawn from african american and latino communities so that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it the problem 's actually a bit worse than this ' cause we 're not just sending poor kids to prison we 're saddling poor kids with court fees with probation and parole 're asking them to live in halfway houses and on house arrest but to make arrest counts to line city coffers young people worried that at any moment i got interested in this other path to adulthood when i was myself a college student attending the university of pennsylvania in the early 2000s private university some of whom are making it to college and many of whom are being shipped to prison in my sophomore year i started tutoring a young woman soon her cousin came home from a juvenile detention a freshman in high school i began to get to know him and his friends and family and i asked him what he thought about me writing about his life for my senior thesis in college this senior thesis became a dissertation at princeton and now a book by the end of my sophomore i moved into the neighborhood and i spent the next six years trying to understand what young people were facing the first week i spent in this neighborhood i saw two boys five and seven years old play this game of chase where the older boy ran after the other boy took a quarter out of the other child 's seizing that he asked the child if he was carrying any drugs or if he had a warrant sometimes children would simply give up running and stick their bodies flat against the ground with their hands above their heads or flat up against a wall children would yell at each other i 'm going to i 'm going to lock you up and you 're never coming home once i saw a six year old child pull another child 's pants down and try to do a cavity search in the first eighteen months that i lived in this neighborhood search people run people 's names with five exceptions i watched the police punch young men after they had caught them chuck and tim chuck was eighteen when we met a senior in high school he was playing on the basketball team and making c 's and b 's they lived with their mom and grandfather in a row home with a front lawn and a back porch their mom was struggling with addiction all while the boys were growing up she never really was able to hold down a job for very long it was the family was really struggling a kid in the schoolyard called chuck 's mom a crack whore chuck pushed the kid 's face into the snow but since chuck was eighteen this agg assault case sent him to adult county jail on state road in northeast philadelphia where he sat unable to pay the bail he couldn 't afford it while the trial dates dragged on and on and on through almost his entire senior year the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges and chuck came home with only a few hundred dollars ' worth of court fees hanging over his head but the school secretary told him that he was then nineteen and too old to be readmitted then the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest because he couldn 't pay the two hundred and twenty five dollars in court fees that came due a few weeks after the case ended then he was a high school dropout living on the run chuck had managed to get his warrant lifted and he was on a payment plan for the court fees and he was driving tim to school in his girlfriend 's car chuck had no idea where in the history of this car it had been stolen his girlfriend 's uncle bought it from a used car auction in northeast philly chuck and tim had never been outside of the tri state but anyway the cops down at the precinct charged chuck with receiving stolen property and then a juvenile judge a few days later chuck sat his little little brother down and began teaching him how to run from the police they how to negotiate a late night police how and where to hide not prison a neighborhood like the one i got to grow up in don 't they deserve to be living in fear of arrest my answer would be no they don 't and certainly not for the same things that other young people with more privilege are doing with impunity if chuck had gone to my high school that schoolyard fight would have ended there as a schoolyard fight it never would have become an aggravated assault case not a single kid that i went to college with has a criminal record right now not a single one but doesn 't this high incarceration rate partly account for our really low crime rate crime is down that 's a good thing totally that is a good thing crime is down the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky we tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way good and bad innocent and guilty injustice is about being wrongfully convicted so if you 're convicted of something you did do you should be punished for it maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that right now asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods who have the least amount of family resources who are attending the country 's worst schools who are facing the toughest time in the labor market who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem we 're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line to basically jail time and this fugitive existence can we imagine something better rather than a criminal justice system that acknowledges the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the u s have faced and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions a criminal justice system that believes in black young people rather than treating black young people as the enemy to be rounded up the good news is that we already are michelle alexander wrote the new jim crow which got americans to see incarceration as a civil rights issue of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before president obama and attorney general eric holder have come out very strongly on sentencing reform on the need to address racial disparity in incarceration we 're seeing states throw out stop and frisk as the civil rights violation that it is we 're seeing cities and states decriminalize possession of marijuana new york new jersey and california have been dropping their prison populations closing prisons while also seeing a big drop in crime texas has gotten into the game now also closing prisons investing in education this curious coalition is building from the right and the left made up of former prisoners and fiscal conservatives of civil rights activists and and older wealthier people some of you are here in the audience pumping big money into initiatives in a deeply divided congress the work of reforming our criminal justice system is just about the only thing that the right and the left are coming together on i did not think i would see this political moment in my i think many of the people who have been working tirelessly to write about the causes and consequences of our historically high incarceration rates i want to end with a call to young people the young people attending college and the young people struggling to stay out of prison or to make it through prison and return home both can be leaders in the work of reforming our criminal justice system young people have always been leaders potentially is to end mass incarceration emphasis on the word justice thanks"
