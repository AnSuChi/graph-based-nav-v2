  "transcript": "two hundred years of modern science the houses we build do not survive severe earthquakes but we shouldn 't be so critical of our scientists for a simple reason they didn 't have much time while nature had three billion years remember these materials carry a quality assurance of three billion years they carry hundreds of tons for hundreds of years and you ask yourself what is it made of surprisingly and this nanocrystalline cellulose so scientists all over the world believe that but here 's the you can google you can ebay you can even alibaba you won 't find it of course you 're going to find thousands of scientific papers great papers where scientists are going to say this is a great together with our partners in sweden decided to focus on the development process to produce this and we found one the sludge of the paper industry there is a lot of it europe alone produces eleven million tons of that material annually it 's the equivalent sitting on a soccer field and for us it 's a gold mine nanocellulose and very soon in sweden we have shown that by adding only a small percent of into cotton fibers the same as my shirt is made of it increases its strength dramatically so this can be used for making but this is not the only thing for example structures like the shelters that you can see now actually are now showcasing in the venice biennale nature actually didn 't stop its wonders think about insects cat fleas for example have the ability to jump about a hundred times their height it 's the equivalent of a person standing in the middle of liberty island in new york and in a single jump going to the top of the statue of liberty i 'm sure everybody would like to do that which is called resilin in simple words resilin which is a protein is the most elastic you can squish it and it doesn 't lose almost any energy to the environment but here 's the problem to catch cat fleas is difficult it 's actually enough to catch one now we can extract its dna and read how cat fleas make the resilin and clone it into a less jumpy organism my team decided to do something really cool at the university decided to combine the strongest material produced by the plant kingdom with the most elastic material produced by the insect kingdom nanocellulose with resilin and the result is amazing so there are lots of things that can be done with this material for example run faster and even touch screens for computers the problem is we continue which we glue and screw because they fail this synthetic fails just like this plastic fork that is not strong enough for its performance the reason is that in nature there is no one there that actually takes my head and screws it onto my neck in nature everything is self assembled whether coming from a plant insect or human being has a dna nanobio building blocks many times they are proteins other times they are enzymes that make other materials like polysaccharides fatty acids and the common feature about all these materials self assemble into structures scaffolds on which cells are proliferating they develop into organs and together bring so we at the hebrew university about ten years ago decided to focus on probably the most important biomaterial other than water so i always like to say anyone who is in the replacement parts of human beings like to have collagen admittedly before we started our project there were already more than one thousand medical implants made of collagen you know simple things like dermal fillers so where is the problem well the problem is the source the source of dead cows but it 's not the only one also the quality now here i have a personal interest this is my now the scientific literature says that these heart valves start to fail ten years after the operation just like this wall made of bricks that is falling apart yeah so the us food and drug administration we decided to clone all the five human genes responsible for making type i collagen in humans into a transgenic so now the plant has the ability to make human collagen today in israel we except that they have five human genes they 're we harvest the leaves and then the leaves are transported by cooling trucks to the factory there the process of extracting the collagen starts if you ever made a pesto essentially the same thing you get the juice that contains the collagen we concentrate the protein transfer the protein to clean rooms for the final purification and the end result is a collagen identical to what we have in our body untouched brand new and from which we for severe spinal fusion and more recently even we 've been able to launch into the market here in europe a flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers this is not science fiction this is happening now we are using plants to make medical implants for replacement parts for human beings in fact more recently we 've been able to make collagen fibers which are six times stronger than the achilles tendon that 's amazing we thought about the next thing to those fibers by doing that we 've been able to make a superfiber which is about three hundred and eighty percent tougher and three hundred percent more elastic when a patient is transplanted with artificial tendons have better performance after the surgery than we had before the injury in the future we believe we 'll be able to make many nanobio building blocks that nature provided for us collagen and many more and that will enable us to make better machines perform better it will be better it actually will perform better and will last longer my friend zion suliman once told me a smart you should open an old book and i 'm going to say that the book was written it was written over three billion years of evolution and the text is the dna of life all we have to do is read this text embrace nature 's gift to us and start our progress from here thank you"
