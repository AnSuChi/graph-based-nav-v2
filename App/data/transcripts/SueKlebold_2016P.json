  "transcript": "the last time i heard my son 's voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school he called out one word in the darkness my son dylan and his friend eric killed twelve students and a teacher leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma others sustained injuries some resulting in disfigurement and but the enormity of the tragedy can 't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place there 's no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts there 's no way to assess the magnitude of a tragedy like columbine especially when it can be a blueprint for other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own and when the crash ended it would take years for the community and for society to comprehend its impact it has taken me years to try to accept my son the cruel behavior that defined the end of his life afterwards people asked how could you not know what kind of a mother were you helping my children become caring healthy responsible adults was the most aside from his father i was the one person who knew and loved dylan the most if anyone could have known what was happening it should have been me right but i didn 't know today i 'm here to share the experience of what it 's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts but there are no simple answers i can 't give you any solutions all i can do i have three challenges to meet when i walk into a room like this i never know if someone there has experienced loss because of what my son did i feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family who isn 't here i 'm sorry the second challenge i have is that i must ask for understanding and even compassion when i talk about my son 's death as a when i talk about his death as a suicide i 'm not trying to downplay the viciousness he showed at the end of his life trying to understand how his suicidal thinking led to murder after a lot of reading and talking with experts i have come to believe that his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill the third challenge i have when i talk about my son 's is that i 'm talking about mental health excuse me is that i 'm talking about mental health i 'm talking about violence the last thing i want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding that already exists around mental illness only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness are violent toward other people but of those who die by suicide it 's estimated that about seventy five to maybe more than ninety percent have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind as you all know very well our mental health care system is not equipped to help everyone and not everyone with destructive thoughts fits the criteria for a specific diagnosis many who have ongoing feelings of fear too often they get our attention only if they reach a behavioral crisis if estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person when suicide i wanted to understand what was going on in dylan 's mind prior to his death so i looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss i did research and volunteered to help with fund raising events and whenever i could i talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt one of the most helpful conversations i had was with a coworker who overheard me talking to someone else in my office cubicle later when she found me alone she apologized for overhearing that conversation but told me that i was wrong she said that when she was a young single mother with three small children she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe at the time she was certain that her children would be better off if she died so she had made a plan to end her life but because of her illness she was sure that they would be better off without her what she said and what i 've learned from others is that we do not make the so called decision or choice to die by suicide in the same way that we choose what car to when someone is in an extremely suicidal state they are in a stage four medical health emergency their thinking is impaired and they 've lost access to tools of even though they can make a plan and act with logic their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain through which they interpret their reality some people can be very good at hiding this state and they often have good reasons for doing that but persistent ongoing thoughts of suicide the condition has i wanted to know how his suicidal thinking yes he probably had he had a personality that was and self reliant and that made him less likely to seek help from others he had experienced triggering events at the school that left him feeling debased and and he had a complicated friendship with a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alienation and who was seriously and on top of this period in his life of extreme vulnerability and fragility dylan found access to guns even though we 'd never owned any in our home without my permission or knowledge it 's still appallingly easy what dylan did that day broke my heart and two years after that i began to have mental health problems perpetual grief i was terrified that i would run into a family member of someone dylan had killed or be accosted by the press or by an angry citizen i started having panic attacks when i was getting ready for the depositions and would have to meet the victims ' families face to face the attacks happened everywhere in the hardware store in my office even while reading a book in bed my mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror and no matter how i hard i tried to it felt as if my brain was trying to kill me and then being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts with therapy and medication and self care when i looked back on all that had happened i could see that my son 's spiral into dysfunction probably occurred over a period of about two years plenty of time to get him help if only someone had known that he needed help and known what to do every time someone asks me how could you not have known it feels like a punch in the gut it carries accusation and taps into my feelings of guilt that no matter how much therapy i 've had but here 's something i 've learned if love were enough to stop someone who is suicidal from hurting themselves suicides would hardly ever happen but love is not enough it 's the second leading cause of death for people age ten to thirty four i 've learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can we cannot know or and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves or someone else can cause us to miss what 's hidden in plain sight and if worst case have to learn to forgive ourselves for not knowing or for not asking the right questions or not finding the right treatment we should always assume that someone we love may be suffering regardless of and without offering i know that i will live with this tragedy i know that in the minds of many i know my struggle doesn 't make theirs i know there are even some who think but only to a life of permanent penance in the end what i know comes down to this the tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to we must never stop trying to know the unknowable"
