  "transcript": "whatever life throws at us whether it 's cancer diabetes heart disease or even broken bones we want to try and get better now i 'm head of a biomaterials lab and i 'm really fascinated by the way that humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body this beautiful blue nacre shell this was actually used by the mayans as an artificial tooth replacement but it also had other very nice properties in fact when they put it into the jawbone and i think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology but if we if we move on and think throughout history how people have one of my favorite examples is that of sir harold ridley who was a famous at least became a famous ophthalmologist and this led him to propose that material bioinert their very purpose was to perform a mechanical function you 'd put them in the body and you wouldn 't get an adverse response and what i want to show you is that in regenerative medicine we 've really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material we 're actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive and then they 'll dissolve away over time typically from the patient we can put those onto a material and if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world in all the different labs in the world there 's pretty much every tissue you can think of and actually the structure of those tissues is quite different and it 's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease other conditions their biochemistry their mechanics and many other properties as well who made a rather tricky career choice and was punished by the greek gods and so day after day he was punished and liver will regenerate in this very nice way but actually if we think of other tissues like cartilage so it 's going to be very different from tissue to tissue and bone is actually quite good at repairing it has to be we 've probably all had fractures at some point or other and one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here and what the surgeon might do is is take some bone from but the problem is there 's only so much you can take and also so what we were thinking is there 's a tremendous need for bone repair of course but this really has a lot of limitations to it and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these very very painful and we got rid of the need to culture these and what we really focused on was our material system and making it quite simple so we were using the body as really the catalyst to help us to make lots of new bone and i 'll talk you through this so what we do is in humans we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones that layer is called the periosteum and that layer is actually normally and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture to help you so we take that periosteum layer and we developed a way to inject underneath it a liquid that then within thirty seconds would turn into quite a rigid gel so it creates in essence an artificial cavity and we go in through a pinhole incision so that no other cells from the body can get in and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells and they can form lots of new tissue essentially what we see is is very large amounts of bone so in this picture you can see the middle of the leg so the bone marrow then you can see the original bone and you can see where that original bone finishes and that demarcation that you can see between the original bone and the new bone acts so you 're left with the leg in the same sort of state as if you hadn 't operated on it in the first place so it 's very very low in terms of compared to an iliac crest harvest and you can grow different amounts of bone depending on how much gel you put in there so it really is an on demand sort of procedure now at the time that we did this this received a lot of attention in the press because it was a really nice way of generating new bone and we got many many contacts from different people that were interested in using this and i 'm just going to tell you sometimes most interesting let me put it that way contact that i had was actually from a team of american footballers that all wanted to have double thickness skulls made on on their and so you you do get these kinds of contacts and of course being british and also growing up in france i tend to be very and so i had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case there probably wasn 't that much in there to protect in the first place and actually we know that those cells in the in the body in the embryo as they develop can form and this approach works really well i think for pre planned procedures but it 's something you do have to pre plan so for other kinds of operations there 's definitely a need for other scaffold based approaches and when you think about designing those other scaffolds and so our team has chemists it has cell biologists surgeons physicists even and those people all come together and we think really hard about designing the materials but we want to make them have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want but not be so complex as to make it difficult to obviously my own favorite tissue and if we zoom in again we see that the cells are actually surrounded by a 3d and they give a lot of information to the cells and that 's led to a whole field really that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid and so i 'm showing here just two examples where we 've made some materials that have that sort of structure and you can really tailor it you can see here a very squishy one and an inorganic material would normally be really brittle and so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in 3d and give them a little bit more information and there 's a lot of work going on in both of these areas now finally i just want to talk a little bit about applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease because this is a really big clinical problem and one of the things that we know is that unfortunately if you have a heart attack then that tissue can start and your outcome may not be very good and there 's lots and lots of stem cell trials going on worldwide and they use many different types of cells but one common theme that seems to be coming out is that actually very often those cells will die once you 've implanted them and you can either put them into the heart or into the blood system but either way we don 't seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful cell regeneration that we would like and so some of the things that we 're thinking of and many other people in the field are thinking of are actually developing materials for that but there 's a difference here we still need chemistry we still need mechanics we still need really interesting topography and we still need really interesting ways to surround the cells because the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals between themselves you can see them now on these materials and that 's a very very exciting development that 's going on so just to wrap up i 'd like to actually say that being able to work in this this sort of field all of us that work in this field that 's not only super exciting science but also has the potential to impact on patients however big or small they are is really a great privilege and so for that i 'd like to thank all"
