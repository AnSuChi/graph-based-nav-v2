  "transcript": "i rented a car in jerusalem to go find a man i 'd never met but who had changed my life but i knew his name abed and i knew that twenty one years before just outside this holy city and so on an overcast morning in january i headed north off in a silver chevy to find a man and some peace the road dropped and i exited jerusalem heavy with four tons of floor tiles had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where i sat i was then nineteen years old i 'd grown five inches and done some twenty thousand pushups i didn 't see abed coming from my seat i was looking up at a stone town on a bright in the noontime sun when from behind there was a great bang as loud and violent as a bomb i was a quadriplegic over the coming months i learned to breathe on my own then to sit and to stand and to college ended and i returned to jerusalem for a year i leaned on my cane and i looked back finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus and when i saw this photograph i didn 't see a bloody and unmoving body and i mourned that it was lost mourned all i had not yet done but was now impossible it was then i read the testimony that abed gave the morning after the crash of driving down the right lane of a highway toward jerusalem it was the first time i 'd felt anger toward this man and it came from magical thinking on this xeroxed piece of paper the crash had not yet happened abed could still turn his wheel left so that i would see him whoosh by out my window and i would remain whole be careful abed look out slow down but abed did not slow i decided to find abed and when i finally it seemed he 'd been awaiting my phone call and maybe he had i didn 't mention to abed his prior driving record violations by the age of the last his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that may day and i didn 't mention my prior record the quadriplegia and the catheters the insecurity and the loss i said i wanted to meet i let abed and the crash go i pitched overhand typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger each centering on a life that had changed in an instant each of us had a before and an after i 'd been working through my lot after all still abed was far from my mind when last year i returned to israel to write of the crash and the book was nearly complete when i recognized that i still wanted to meet abed and finally i understood why to hear this man say two words i 'm sorry when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering but what to get the man who broke your fucking neck better abed would spit at me abed would say i 'm sorry had my genes been fed a different helping of experience who was i before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book were all of us the results of things done to us done for us money inherited but how to tease out the one from the other o brightening glance how can we know the dancer from the dance i 'd been driving for an hour the light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue the predispositions and impulses that had propelled me as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a chicago lake that had propelled me as a teen to jump into wild cape cod but i also saw in my reflection that had abed not injured me i would now in all likelihood be a doctor and a husband the frequent furl of five fingers the chips in my teeth come from seven beautiful mazurkas and i pulled into a lot by a gas station to listen and to calm i 'd been told that in an arab town one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized when i met mohamed outside a post office at noon you know it was most often when speaking to people that i wondered where i ended and my disability began for many people told me what they told no one else many cried and one day after a woman i met on the street did the same and i later asked her why but vulnerable he led me to a house of cream stucco then drove off i stepped from my car and said and she told me that her husband abed would be home from work in four hours her hebrew was not good and she later confessed that she thought that i had come to install the internet thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back and as i approached the front door abed saw slippers over socks pilling sweatpants a piebald sweater a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead and i gave him my gift it was then that abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone sixteen years before he 'd lost his teeth in the crash abed then rose and turned on the tv so that i wouldn 't be alone when he left the room and returned with polaroids of the crash and his old driver 's license abed had been less handsome than substantial it was this youth who on may sixteen two necks including mine and bruised one brain and taken one life and recognized his longing the crash changed and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass and so i didn 't point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash i was quiet because i had not come for truth i had come for remorse and so i now went looking for remorse and threw truth under the bus but does it make you sad that others suffered i suffered abed then told me why news on the tv of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north we looked up at the wreckage agreed the report finished and abed spoke it is a pity he said that the police in this country before the crash well he said i once went sixty in a forty and so violations and finally riding his brakes down that hill reduced to one and it was then i understood that no matter how stark the reality the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable the goat it was then i understood that abed would never apologize he was a limited man but it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing to one whose life was so unexamined that he said he thought two people had died in the crash i wished to tell him that were he to acknowledge my disability it would be okay people don 't know that they have lived through worse that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck that problems of the mind are greater still injurious than a hundred broken necks but how we respond to what happens to us this wrote the psychiatrist viktor frankl is the last of the human freedoms to choose one 's attitude in any given set of circumstances but we all must the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding i wished to tell him that one does not have to say that a bad thing is good that a crash is from god and so a crash is good a broken neck is i wished to tell him that in the end our mandate is clear we have to rise above bad fortune study and work and adventure and friendship oh friendship and community but most of all i wished to tell him what herman melville wrote that some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast you are mindful of what you do not have you may be truly mindful of what you do have and if the gods are kind you may truly enjoy what you have and so may wake each morning pulsing with ready life and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm or even to be cold i told him only that he had killed one man i told him the name of that man and then i said"
