  "transcript": "and i say believe because this process is still ongoing right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year i 'll talk a little bit about in the last one hundred and fifty years since jules verne had great science fiction concepts of what the underworld was like is that we can now descend thousands of meters along the way we 've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight when you go on a thing like this we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months with a team as small as twenty or thirty to as big as one hundred and fifty and a lot of people ask me you know what kind of people do you get for a project like this we 're looking for and strength in case you 're wondering this is our strength test but we also value esprit de corps we have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance this is nothing like a a commercial cave you 're looking at camp two in a place called and it 's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse except that you 're now running a string of these things down the idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you 're down there otherwise in damp moist cold conditions in utterly dark places otherwise it is completely dark in these places it 's basically like a tree collecting water coming down and eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don 't do justice so i 've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s so descend into huautla plateau in mexico now i have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous we would not do this today unless we were doing it for film we have never seen monsters underground at least the kind that eat you if there is it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound nearest entrance next year i 'll be leading an international team to j2 we 're going to be shooting from minus two thousand six hundred meters that 's a little over eight thousand six hundred feet down the lead crews will be underground for pushing thirty days straight i don 't think there 's been a mission like that in a long time eventually if you keep going down in these things probability says that you 're going to run into a place like this it 's a place where there 's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof and when you used to find these things they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon now i remember that term really well for two reasons number one it 's the name of my rock band and we 've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this this is some life support equipment closed cycle and you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of two hundred meters straight down underwater when you do this kind of stuff extra vehicular activity in space but at much greater distances and at much greater physical peril so it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range away from a safe haven here 's a clip from a national geographic movie that came out in was taken in wakulla springs florida couple of things to note about that movie every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and it produced the first this is europa this is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there for those who have never seen this story jim cameron produced a really wonderful imax movie couple of years ago called aliens of the deep there was a brief clip narrator europa is so far away that even at the speed of light it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the it has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice now we have to get through the ice the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean you need an auv an able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean bs what jim didn 't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier nasa had funded a team i assembled to develop a prototype for the europa auv i mean i cut through design and system integration it 's got ninety six sensors thirty six onboard computers one hundred thousand lines of behavioral autonomy code this is the target site the world 's deepest hydrothermal spring at cenote zacaton in northern mexico it this is part of depthx 's mission there are two primary targets we 're doing here one is how do you do science autonomy underground how do you take a robot and turn it a field microbiologist halide things like that we calculate gradient surfaces and drive the bot over to a wall where there 's a high probability of life we move along the wall in what 's called proximity operations looking for changes in color if we see something that looks interesting we pull it into a microscope or we can actually take a solid core depthx is an eyeball its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time allowing it to do new exploration while it 's still achieving geometric sensor lock on what it 's gone through already what i 'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that 's ever been done 're going to go from minus one thousand meters in zacaton and if we 're very lucky depthx will bring back the first the next step after that is to test it in antartica and then if the funding continues we could potentially launch by two thousand and sixteen and by two thousand and nineteen we may have the first evidence of life off this planet the government recently announced plans to return to the moon by the successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were fifty years ago something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime what i 'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas and i hope you 'll bear with me and and have some faith that there 's credibility behind what we 're going to say here there are three underpinnings of working in space one of them is the requirement for economical earth to space transport the bert rutans and richard bransons of this world have got this in their sights and i salute them go go go orbital hotels to start with but workshops for the rest of us later on the final missing piece the real it 's not going to look like that it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning now to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement i 've got to give you the basics of space one hundred and one and the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram that 's more than you pay for thus every time you 'd want to do anything in space you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator not even the guys at tesla can fight that physics you could get your gas at a 10th the price there is a place where you can in fact you can get it better you can get it at fourteen times lower if you can find propellant on the moon thirteen years ago now called clementine and the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon that signal was so strong it could only have been produced if we 're going to get that and make that gas station we have to beat that we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics we can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything this is an idea that again came out of livermore back in lowell wood 's group and we can extend that now orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water there 's another thing when you 're coming back from the moon you have to deal with orbital mechanics it says you 're moving ten thousand feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station you got two choices you can burn rocket fuel to get there it 's risky and it 's going to be one hell of a ride the traditional approach to space exploration if you try to do that for the moon you 're going to burn a billion dollars but if you send a mining team there without the return propellant first did any of you guys hear the story of cortez but if you were truly bold you could get it there manufacture it and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done there 's a myth that you can 't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars we could pull off an industrial mission to shackleton and demonstrate that you could the orbital refueling stations i 've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration we can do it by jump starting with an industrial lewis and clark i would like to close here i intend to lead that expedition those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who had they been here today would have heartily approved"
