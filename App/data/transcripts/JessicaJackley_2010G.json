  "transcript": "the stories we tell about each other matter very much the stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter and most of all i think the way that we participate in each other 's stories i was six years old when i first heard stories about the poor now i didn 't hear those stories from the poor themselves i heard them from i remember learning that people who were poor needed something material food clothing shelter that they didn 't have and i also was taught coupled with that that it was my job this classroom full of five and six year old children it was our job i was very eager to be useful in the world i think we all have that feeling and also it was kind of interesting that god needed help that was news to me and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in but i also learned very soon thereafter that jesus also said and i 'm paraphrasing the poor would always be with us this frustrated and confused so i felt confused a little bit frustrated and angry like maybe i 'd misunderstood something here and i felt overwhelmed and for the first time i began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people i imagined in my head a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away that would always be with us they were always going to ask me to help them and give them things which what would happen when i ran out of things to give the other stories i heard about the poor growing up were no for example i saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering i heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor i heard about disease i heard about war they always seemed to be kind of related and in general i got this sort of idea that the poor poor in the world and after a while i developed what i think many of us do is this predictable response where i started to feel bad every and i even felt a sense of shame because of that and i stopped expecting things to i gave when solutions were on sale the cost of a cup of coffee can save a child 's life right i mean who can argue with that i gave when i was cornered when it was difficult to avoid and i gave in general when the negative emotions built up enough that i gave to relieve my own suffering not someone else 's the truth be told i was giving out of that place not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and became sort of a trade i was purchasing something i was buying my right to go on with my day and i think the way that we go through that sometimes can first of all disembody a group of people individuals out there in the world and it can also turn into a commodity which is a very scary thing as i did this and as i think many of us do this we kind of buy our distance we kind of buy our right to go on with our day i think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most it can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person 's life and in short to love thankfully a few years ago things shifted for me because i heard this gentleman speak dr muhammad yunus i know many in the room probably know exactly who he is but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak dr yunus won the nobel peace prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance when i heard him speak it was three years before that but basically microfinance if this is new to you as well think of that as financial services for the poor think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day story explaining what that was and what he had done with his grameen bank he also talked about in particular microlending which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business now it was exciting for a number of reasons first and foremost i learned about this new method of change in the world that for once showed me maybe a way to interact with someone and to to share of a resource in a way that wasn 't weird and didn 't make me feel bad that was exciting but more importantly hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family 's lives better all they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital and i moved to east africa to try to see for myself what this was about for the first time actually in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals i wanted to meet these entrepreneurs and see for myself what their lives were actually i spent three months in kenya uganda and tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received one hundred dollars to start or grow a business and in fact through those interactions for the first time i was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away so i would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats their business trajectory would change they would make a little bit more money their standard of living would maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and some days that 's what happened these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them that was another thing that really touched me it was really humbling to see for the first time to really understand that even if i could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything i probably would have gotten a lot wrong because the best way for people to change which had kind of been my mode right there 's poverty you give money to help no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all if anything they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and so what i did hear once in a while was that people wanted a loan i thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting and by the way i was a philosophy and poetry major in school so i didn 't know the difference between profit and revenue when i went to east africa i just got this impression my introduction to business was in these $ one hundred little infuses of capital and i learned about profit and revenue about leverage all sorts of things from farmers from seamstresses from goat herders so this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family and through that maybe we could get some of the money that they needed that 's this little idea that turned into kiva a few months went back to uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner matthew and i had kind of built spammed friends and family and said we think this is legal haven 't heard back yet from sec on all the details but do you say do you want to help participate in this provide the money that they need the money came in basically overnight we sent it over to uganda and over the next six months a beautiful thing happened they were paid and their businesses in fact grew and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives in october of ' five and then that first year october ' five through ' six kiva facilitated $ five hundred thousand in loans the second year it was a total of fifteen million the third year the total was up to around forty the fourth year we were just short of one hundred and today less than five years in kiva 's facilitated more than one hundred and fifty million dollars in little 25 dollar bits from lenders and entrepreneurs more than a million of those collectively in two hundred countries validates a partnership relationship not a relationship that 's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary but instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this this optimism that together we can move forward so what i hope is that not only can the money keep flowing forth through kiva that 's a very positive and meaningful thing but i hope kiva can blur those lines like i said between the traditional rich and poor because as imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you 're about to approach them imagine how you feel and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business maybe they 're smiling and they want to talk to you about what they 've done imagine if you 're speaking with somebody who 's growing things and making them flourish somebody who 's using their talents not somebody with full hands with something to offer not empty hands asking for you to give them something imagine if you could hear a story you didn 't expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very very hard to make their life better these stories can really change the way that we think about each other and if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money i think that can change the way we we believe in each other and each other 's potential now for me kiva is just the beginning and as i look forward to what is next it 's been helpful to reflect on the things i 've it 's deciding that you want your life to be better you see an opportunity and you decide what you 're going to do to try when you give something to someone and they say and they slowly pay you back over time you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue this continued attention this ongoing attention is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us and then third from what i 've heard from the entrepreneurs i 've gotten to know when all else is equal given the option to have just money to do what you need to do or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community people choose the community plus the money that 's a much more meaningful combination a more powerful combination so with that in mind this particular incident has led to the things that i 'm working on now i see entrepreneurs everywhere now now that i 'm tuned into this and one thing that i 've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world with social networks it 's an amazing way growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities and so as i have been thinking about this i 've been wondering how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to as i 've researched what 's going on in the united states a few interesting little insights have come up so one is that of course as we all might expect many small businesses in the u s and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month but there 's always a need for resources another thing is it turns out those resources don 't usually come from the places you might expect banks venture capitalists and third so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process it 's very awkward people don 't know exactly what even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them so to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like exactly what fits them and the people around them this week actually we 're quietly doing a launch of profounder which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family and it 's investments not donations not loans but investments that have a dynamic return so the mapping of participating in the story it actually flows with the up and down so in short and we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues they can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited unsophisticated investors everyday people heaven forbid and they can share those returns over time again whatever terms they set as investors choose to become involved based on those terms they can either take their rewards back as cash or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non profit so they can be a cash or a cause investor it 's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people so that 's what i 'm working on now and to close i just want to say look these are tools right now profounder 's right at the very beginning and it 's very palpable it 's very clear to me that it 's just a vessel it 's just a tool what we need are for people to care to actually go use it i don 't think even though we often hear you know hear the ethical and moral reasons the religious reasons here 's why caring and giving will make you happier i don 't think we need to be convinced of that i think we know in fact i think we know so much and it 's such a reality that we care so deeply that in fact what usually stops us is that we 're afraid to try and to mess up because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other 's lives so and i think i can remind us that we do care i think we all already know that and i think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and the best way to be inspired to try guaranteed i am inspired i am inspired by the person i am listening to and i believe more and more every time i listen in that that person 's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help and that forget the tools forget the moving around of resources that stuff 's easy believing in each other really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us so thank you"
