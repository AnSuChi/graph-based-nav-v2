  "transcript": "baby diapers have interesting properties they can swell enormously when you add water to them an experiment done by millions of kids every day but what we 're trying to do in my group at mit is to figure out if we can do something similar if you will maybe we could try to pinpoint the exact changes in the brain that result in diseases diseases like alzheimer 's and epilepsy and parkinson 's and for which very often we don 't know the cause or the origins and what 's really causing them to occur now our group at mit is trying to take a different point of view from the way neuroscience has been done over the last hundred years we 're designers we 're inventors we 're trying to figure out how to build technologies that let us look at and repair the brain and the reason is the brain is and electrical currents will flow through these complexly shaped neurons furthermore neurons are connected in networks they 're connected by little junctions called synapses that exchange chemicals and allow the neurons to talk to each other the density of the brain is incredible in a cubic millimeter of your brain there are about one hundred thousand of these neurons so if you could zoom in to a neuron and of course this is just our artist 's rendition of it what you would see are thousands and thousands of kinds of biomolecules little nanoscale machines organized in complex and together they mediate those electrical pulses those chemical exchanges that allow neurons to work together to generate things like thoughts and feelings and so forth now we don 't know how the neurons in the brain are organized to form networks and we don 't know how the biomolecules are organized within neurons to form these complex organized machines if we really want to understand this we 're going to need maybe we could really understand how the brain conducts information and once we know how those molecules have changed we 've all seen lots of different technologies over the last century to try to confront this i think we 've all seen brain scans taken using mri machines these of course have the great power that they are noninvasive they can be used on living human subjects so it 's not at the level of resolution where it can pinpoint the molecular changes that occur or the changes in the wiring of these networks that contributes to our ability to be conscious and powerful beings you have microscopes microscopes of course will use light to look at little tiny things for centuries they 've been used to look at things like bacteria you can 't see individual molecules with a regular old microscope you so if we want to make our ability to see the brain more powerful to get down to the ground truth structure we 're going to need to have even better technologies why can 't we make the brain bigger it initially started with two grad students in my group fei chen and paul tillberg now many others in my group are helping with this process we decided to try to figure out if we could take we brought a little demo here we got some purified baby diaper material it 's much easier just to buy it off the internet than to extract the few grains that actually occur in these diapers i 'm going to put just one teaspoon here of this purified polymer you 're going to see it increase in volume by about a thousandfold before your very eyes i could pour much more of this in there but i think you could zoom in it might look something like what you see on the screen about the width of a biomolecule and these polymers are really dense they 're separated by distances that are around the size of a this is very good because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain if we add water what will happen is and because these chains are so tiny and spaced by biomolecular biomolecular distances we could potentially blow up the brain and make it big enough to see if we could do that maybe we could get ground truth maps of the we could look at the wiring we can peer inside and see the molecules within we made some animations where we actually look at in these artist renderings what biomolecules might look like and how we might separate them step one what we 'd have to do first of all is attach every biomolecule shown in brown here and to do that we need to have a little and to pull the molecules apart from each other all right the moment of truth the image is the same but in three dimensions there 's one last trick as you can see here we 've color coded all the biomolecules brown that 's because they all kind of look the same another kind of and that 's the final step so the hope here is that we can make the invisible visible we can turn things that might seem small and obscure and blow them up until they 're like constellations here 's an actual video of what it might look like we have here a little brain in a dish a little piece of a brain actually what you 'll see is that right before your eyes this video is sped up about sixtyfold this little piece of brain tissue is going to grow it 's a smooth expansion so now we can take actual brain circuitry here 's a piece of the brain involved with for example memory and we can zoom in we can start to actually look at how circuits are configured maybe we could actually look at how circuits are configured to process emotions how the actual wiring of our brain is organized in to make us who we are and of course we can pinpoint hopefully the actual problems in the brain at a molecular level what if we could actually look into cells in the brain and figure out wow here are the seventeen molecules that have altered in this brain tissue that has been undergoing epilepsy or changing in parkinson 's disease or otherwise being altered if we get that systematic list of things that are going wrong those become our therapeutic targets we can build drugs that bind those we can maybe aim energy at different parts of the brain in order to help people with parkinson 's or epilepsy or other conditions that affect over a billion people around the world it turns out that throughout biomedicine there are other problems that expansion might help with this is an actual biopsy from a human breast cancer patient it turns out that if you look at if you look at development so what we 're trying to do now is to figure out if we can actually use this technology to map the building blocks of life in a wide variety of diseases we actually pinpoint the molecular changes in a tumor so that we can actually go after it in a smart way and deliver drugs that might wipe out exactly the cells that we want to you know sometimes it 's even guesswork it was based on solid science we but in medicine we don 't necessarily have all the laws do we have all the laws that are analogous to gravity that are analogous to aerodynamics i would argue that with technologies like the kinds i 'm and figure out how to overcome the diseases that plague us you know my wife and i have two young kids and one of my hopes as a bioengineer is to make life better for them than it currently is for us and my hope is if we can turn biology and medicine from these high risk endeavors that are governed by make them things that we win by skill and hard work then that would be a great advance thank you very much"
