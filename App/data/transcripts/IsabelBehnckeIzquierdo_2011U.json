  "transcript": "it 's a place where women run the show have sex to say hello and play rules the day where fun is serious business burning man or san francisco this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of congo bonobos are together with chimpanzees your living closest relative who lived around six million now chimpanzees are well known for their aggression while chimpanzees are dominated by big scary guys bonobo society is run by empowered females these guys have really worked something out since this leads to a highly tolerant society bonobos are the least understood of the great apes and it has been very difficult to study them the congo is a paradox but also the heart of darkness itself the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as first world war not surprisingly this destruction bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn 't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world and we 're not even sure of that to be honest in this land of violence and chaos you can hear hidden laughter who are these cousins we know them as the make love not war apes i 'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity 's problems since there 's more to bonobo life than the kama sutra bonobos like humans love to play throughout their entire lives play is not just child 's games for us and them play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance it 's where we learn to trust play increases creativity and it 's all about the generation of diversity diversity of connections and when you watch bonobo play you 're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter dance and ritual play is the glue that binds us bonobo style we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase she 's got him by the balls only i think that he 's rather loving it here right yeah and this video is really interesting because it shows this video 's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play such as testicles and and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust while at the same time being tremendous fun but play 's a shapeshifter play 's a shapeshifter and it can take many forms some of this is fuku a young female and she is quietly playing with water and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds and then the unexpected connections we form so these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present but they also hold a secret for our future a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world creativity and greater cooperation the secret is that play is the key to these capacities in other words play is our adaptive wildcard in order to adapt successfully to a changing world we need to play but will we make the most of our playfulness play is not frivolous let us fellowship and wonder thank you"
