  "transcript": "i was about ten years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state it was a beautiful day the forest was sparkling and if it weren 't for the path it was a lean to on a bluff looking over a crystal beautiful lake when i discovered a horror maybe forty feet square with rotting apple cores and and i was deeply confused the campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in who did they think would clean up after them and it simplified a little who cleans up after however you configure or wherever you place the us who cleans up after us in istanbul who cleans up after us in rio here in new york i wanted to get to know them so i took the job as a sanitation it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education it 's there but it 's not as prevalent as you think and on days when it is really bad you get used to it rather quickly the weight takes a long time to get used to i knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week and i learned why you 're in and out of traffic all day and it 's zooming around you it just wants to get past you so it 's often the motorist is not paying attention and then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm i also learned about the relentlessness of trash when you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself it never stops coming it 's also like a form of respiration and then there 's the stigma you put on the uniform and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you 've blocked traffic with your truck or you 're taking a break too close to their home or you 're drinking coffee in their diner i find the stigma especially ironic because i strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city for three reasons they are the first guardians of public health containments and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real diseases we 've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us and then there 's what i call we usually don 't care for repair clean carry around our coffee cup so i want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane their work i think is kind of liturgical and their work lets us do our work they are almost a form of reassurance the flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves from our own dross our cast offs and that flow must be maintained always no matter what i but i started to cry and he said we and we became good friends we must include and take and we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling states and countries around the world and lift us up to a broader horizon where we 're looking at other forms of waste municipal waste what we think of when we talk about garbage accounts for three percent of the nation 's waste stream it 's a so next time you see someone whose job is take a moment to say thank you"
