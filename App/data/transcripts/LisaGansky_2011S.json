  "transcript": "i 'm speaking to you about what i call the mesh it 's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff with the things in our lives and it 's starting to look at not always and not for everything but in certain moments of time access to certain kinds of goods and we 've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in amsterdam universities all these things are but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what i refer to as the mother of all i think there 's a number of vectors that i want to give you as background one is the recession that the recession has we 're reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet also there 's been this recent distrust of big brands global big brands in a bunch of different industries and that 's created an opening research is showing here in the states and in canada and western europe that most of us are much more open to local we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted and last is that we 're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before except for if you 're sitting next to someone it 's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point a to point b and the investment and so for me a mesh company the brings together these three things our ability to connect to each other most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are and web enabled allows us to find each other and find things in time and space and third is that physical things are readable on a map so restaurants a variety of venues but also with gps and other technology like expand beyond that we can also track things that are moving like a car a taxicab a transit system a box that 's moving through time and space and so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them was actually invented in europe one of the founders went went to switzerland saw it implemented someplace said wow that looks really cool i think we can do that in cambridge brought it to cambridge and they started two women robin chase being the other person who started and so they were very clever about the way that they packaged when you 're a member of a club you 're a zipster the cars they picked cars that were hollowed out or something they picked these sexy cars they targeted to universities they made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car and you 're going to the mountains to ski you get different accessories put on and so it 's not only an option for them but i believe it 's an imperative for zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us to be like a concierge service because we give them so much any guesses those are really very good and so basically even if you think it 's ten percent ninety percent of the time something that costs us a lot of money personally and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things i think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that if we squeeze hard on things that we 've thrown away there 's a lot of value in those things what set up with zipcar zipcar started in two thousand in the last year two thousand and ten two car companies started one u k called whipcar and the other one relayrides in the u s they 're both services because the two things that really the car has to be available and two it 's within one or two blocks of where you stand well the car that 's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor 's car and it 's probably also available so people have created this business it took them six months to get one thousand cars in the service so really interesting people are making anywhere between two hundred and seven hundred dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they 're not using it so it 's like vacation rentals for cars since i 'm here and and i hope some people in the audience are in the car business it would be really great if any minute now you guys could start rolling share ready cars off because it just creates more flexibility it allows us as owners to have other options and i think we 're going there anyway the opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses and those are businesses like zipcar or netflix that are full mesh businesses or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies car manufacturers who are beginning to offer their own car share services as well as a second flanker brand or as really a test i think is to make sharing irresistible we have experiences in our lives it 's just how do we make that recurrent and scale it we know also because we 're connected in social networks that it 's contagious because we 're all connected to each other so if i have a terrific experience and i tweet it or i tell five people standing next to me news travels the opposite as we know is also true often again it 's because i 'm a tech entrepreneur i look at things as platforms platforms are invitations so creating craigslist or itunes and the iphone developer network there are all these networks facebook as well these platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of to create and target an application for a particular audience and honestly it 's full of surprises because i don 't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at facebook around facebook for example so in this way i think that cities are platforms and certainly detroit is a platform the invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive invited all sorts of participation now we 're saying that there 's other options as well so for example can open up transit data google has made available transit data api and so there 's about seven or eight cities already in the u s that have provided the transit data and different developers are building applications so i was having a coffee in portland and half of a latte in and the little board in the in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in sixteen minutes and so it 's reliable real data there 's this fabulous opportunity we have across the u s now about twenty one percent of vacant commercial and industrial space that space is not vital the areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement there 's this thing how many people here have heard of so i 'm a big fan of this and this is a very a very mesh y thing essentially there are all sorts of and they do a fantastic job of making a very social it happens in a very transitional neighborhood subsequent to that after it 's been going for about a year now they actually started to lease and create and extend an area that was is now starting to become much cooler and and engage a lot more people so this is an example the crafty fox is this woman who 's into crafts and she does these pop up crafts fairs around london but these sorts of things are happening in many different environments from my perspective one of the things it 's very and i 'm willing to share my failures as well though not from the stage when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other but also move to to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation they made a lot of mistakes they had some number of but they were very transparent or they had to be in the way that zero screw ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in paris so the opportunity when we 're connected is also to share failures and successes we 're at the very beginning of something that what we 're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward is inviting it 's engaging but it 's very early i have a website and it grows on a very and thank you very much"
