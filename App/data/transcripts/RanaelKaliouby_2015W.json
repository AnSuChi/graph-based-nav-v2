  "transcript": "our emotions influence every aspect of our lives from our health and how we learn to how we do business and make decisions big ones and small our emotions also influence how we connect but instead we 're living more and more of our lives like this this is the text message from my daughter last night i started on this path a computer scientist so i did something quite unusual for a young newlywed muslim egyptian wife i packed my bags and i moved to england i realized i was spending more hours with my laptop than i did with any other human it had no idea if i was happy i felt that all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace but all i had to communicate these emotions was this so that got me thinking sense our emotions what if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would those questions led me and my team to create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions so our human face happens to be one of the most powerful channels that we all use to empathy and curiosity in emotion science we call each facial muscle movement an action unit it is actually a lip corner pull which is the main component of a smile try it everybody let 's get some smiles going on another example is action unit four it 's the brow furrow it 's when you draw your eyebrows together and you create all these textures and wrinkles we don 't like them and they combine to express hundreds of emotions because these action units they can be fast they 're subtle so take for example the smile and the smirk but they mean very different things so how do we do that we give our algorithms and basically learns that all smiles have common characteristics it essentially learns that i recognize this this is a smile expression so i need a volunteer preferably somebody with a face so let 's give this a try so her eyebrows her eyes her mouth and her nose so first of all give me your poker face yep awesome and then as she smiles this is a genuine smile it 's great so you can see the green bar go up as she smiles now that was a big smile can you try a subtle smile to see if the computer can recognize it does recognize subtle smiles as well we 've worked really hard to make that happen which is an indicator of confusion yes and then give me a disgust face try to remember what it was like when zayn left one direction the valence is actually quite negative so you must have been a big fan so valence is how positive or negative an experience is and engagement is how expressive she is as well so imagine if cloe had access to this real time emotion stream and she could share it with anybody she wanted to thank you we have amassed twelve billion of these emotion data points it 's the largest emotion database in the world we 've collected it from two point nine million face videos it blows gender women are more expressive than men not only do they smile more their smiles last longer and we can now really quantify what it is that that men and women respond to differently let 's do culture so in the united states women are forty percent more expressive than men but curiously we don 't see any difference in the u k between men and women people who are fifty years and older are twenty five percent more emotive than younger people women in their 20s smile a lot more than men the same but perhaps what surprised us the most about this data is that and it 's not just when we 're watching cat videos on facebook where is this data used today in understanding how we engage with media so understanding virality and voting behavior and also empowering or emotion enabling technology and i want to share some examples that are especially close to my heart and it can help individuals on the autism spectrum interpret emotion something that they really struggle with in education imagine if so it 's sped up just like a great teacher would in a classroom or perhaps your fridge knows that you 're stressed so i had access to my real time emotion stream and i could share that with my family back home in a very natural way and we won 't remember what it was like when we couldn 't just frown at our device and our device would say hmm you didn 't like that did you we recognize that there are potential but having spent many years doing this i believe that the benefits to humanity from having emotionally intelligent technology far outweigh the potential for misuse so as more and more of our lives become digital we are fighting a losing battle trying to curb our usage of devices in order to reclaim our emotions so what i 'm trying to do instead is to bring emotions into our technology and make our technologies more responsive so i want those devices that have separated us to bring us back together and by humanizing technology we have this golden opportunity connect with one another"
