  "transcript": "let me connect the dots i 'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love or love to hate i think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle if you publishing games you name it they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences it 's old school demographics they come up with these very restrictive labels to define us now the crazy thing and so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics age demographics has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the now they 've aged out of that demographic but it 's still the case that powerful ratings companies like nielson don 't even take into account viewers of television shows over age fifty four now if you watch mad men like i do it 's a popular tv show in the states dr faye miller does something called psychographics which so i 'm at the norman lear center at usc and we 've done a lot of research over the last seven years and in the last three years we 've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed and we 've discovered some very interesting things because with online networking tools it 's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes we 're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online and we can lie about our age online too pretty easily we can also connect with people based on our very specific interests we don 't need a media company to help do this for us so the traditional media companies of course are paying very close attention to these online communities they know this is the mass audience of the future when they 're monitoring your clickstream you know they are but they get a lot more information about what you do online what you like what interests you that 's easier for them to find out than who you are and even though that 's still sort of creepy and if you think about it shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories i 'd much rather know whether you like buffy the vampire slayer rather than how old you are that would tell me something more substantial about you now there 's something else that we 've discovered about social media that 's actually quite surprising it turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution if you look at the statistics these are worldwide statistics in every single age category and then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites which is a space that 's having a huge impact on old media the question is what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture and what 's it going to mean for women if the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media then does that mean that women are going to take over global media are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on tv shows will the next big budget blockbuster movies well i actually don 't think that 's going to be the case i think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women because they realize this is important for their business and i think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere think women are actually going to be ironically enough responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the chick flick and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things that hispanics like certain that young people like certain things this is far too simplistic where women are really driving the action so you may be asking well why is it important that i know old media companies and advertisers need to know this but my argument is that if you want to understand the global village it 's probably a good idea that you figure out what they 're passionate about what amuses them what they choose to do in their free time this is a very important thing to know about people i 've spent most of my professional life i do it not just because it 's fun though actually it is really fun but also because our research has shown over and over again and so if you have any interest in understanding the world looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start a media atmosphere that isn 't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics can you even imagine what that looks like thank you so much"
