  "transcript": "we are stealing nature from our children now when i say this i don 't mean that we are destroying nature that they will have wanted us to preserve although that is unfortunately also the case what i mean here is that we 've started to define nature in a way that 's so purist and so strict but there 's a fix for this so let me explain humans use half of the world if you added up all the human beings we would weigh ten times as we cut roads through the forest more carbon dioxide than if you were breathing in one thousand seven hundred and fifty so all of these changes and many others have come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric of the anthropocene given how pervasive human influence has been over it now it 's still just a proposed so twenty five years ago environmental writer bill mckibben said that because nature was a thing apart from man and because climate change meant that every centimeter of the earth was altered by man then nature was over his book the end of nature because fundamentally we are animals right like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share and all the other plants and all the other microbes and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman and under that definition things look a little bit different i understand that there are certain parts of this nature that speak to us in a special way and in a way they are less impacted by our day to day activities many of these places have no but ultimately even these edens are deeply north america for example since that 's where we 're meeting so between about fifteen thousand years ago when people first came here they started a process of interacting with the nature that led to the extinction of a big slew of large bodied animals from the mastodon to the giant ground sloth and when those animals went extinct you know the ecosystems didn 't stand still massive ripple effects changed grasslands into forests changed the composition of forest from one tree to another so even in these edens even in these perfect looking places that seem to remind us of a past before humans we 're essentially looking at a humanized landscape not just these prehistoric humans but historical humans indigenous people all the way up until the moment when the first colonizers showed up and the case is the same for the other continents as well humans have just been involved in nature in a very influential way for a very long time now just recently someone told me oh but there are still wild places i was just there but people people have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years people live there and they don 't just float over the jungle they have a meaningful relationship with the landscape they domesticate crops they use the natural resources to build their houses to thatch their houses they even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals these people are there and they 're interacting with the environment in a way that 's really meaningful and that you can see in the environment now i was with an and he told me as we were floating down the river he said there are no demographic voids in the amazon and they continue to influence them in if all of the definitions of nature that that we might want to use that involve it being untouched by humanity or not having people in it if all of those actually give us then maybe they 're the wrong definitions maybe we should define it by the presence of multiple species by the presence of a thriving life now if we do it that way what do we get it 's this kind of miracle all of a sudden there 's nature all around us all of a sudden we see this monarch caterpillar there 's like probably a dozen minimum plant species growing there supporting all kinds of insect life this is and there 's an interesting little paradox too so this nature this crater lake in southern oregon which is my closest national park is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the but they 're managing it carefully one of the issues they have now is white bark pine die off white bark pine is a beautiful charismatic i 'll say it 's a charismatic there 's a blister rust that was introduced bark beetle even in areas that they are otherwise and they 're also putting out beetle repellent in key areas as i saw last time i went hiking there fires are started non native species are and in fact i took a look and banff national park is doing all of the things i just listed suppressing fire having fire radio collaring wolves reintroducing bison it takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched and in a further irony these places that we love the most are the places that we love a little too hard sometimes they often are becoming more fragile over time which means that they 're the absolute worst places to take your children on vacation because you can 't do anything there you can 't climb the trees you can 't fish the fish you can 't make a campfire out in the middle of this is like the worst nature ever because children don 't want to hike through a beautiful landscape for five hours and then look at a beautiful view that 's maybe what we want to do as adults but what kids want to do is hunker down in one spot and just tinker with it just work with it just pick it up build a house build a fort do something like that and they 're expensive to get to they 're hard to visit so this means that they 're only available to the elites and that 's a real problem the and when they asked them why what are the barriers to going outside the response of sixty one percent was there are no natural areas near my home and i 'm sure the figures are similar in other countries every kid lives near nature we 've just somehow forgotten how to see it we 've spent too much time watching david attenborough documentaries where the nature is really sexy and we 've forgotten how to see the nature that is literally there 's this cool elevated railway that you can see from the ground that 's been abandoned this may sound like the beginning of the high line story in manhattan and it 's very similar except they haven 't developed this into a park yet although they 're working on it and if you know and it 's right in the middle of the city and they 've sent people up there to do sort of biosurveys and there are over fifty plant species up there so scientists have started calling ecosystems like these novel ecosystems because they 're often dominated by non native species and because they 're just super weird they 're just unlike anything we 've ever seen before for so long we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash pretty much all of hawaii where novel ecosystems are the norm where exotic species totally dominate this forest here has queensland maple it has sword ferns from southeast asia you can make your own novel ecosystem too it 's really simple you just stop mowing your lawn including two endangered species when you 're up there on that and that 's what it looks like these children have that no other plants no other animals and what i really wanted to do was just like throw a ladder over the side and get all these kids to come up with me into this cool meadow in a way i feel like this is the choice that faces us if we dismiss these new natures as not acceptable or trashy or no good we might as well just pave them over world where everything is changing we need to be very careful about how we define nature and it excludes most of the nature that most people can visit and have a relationship with including because that which is untouched is unloved we face some pretty grim environmental challenges on this planet climate change there 's others too habitat loss is my favorite thing to freak out about in the middle of the i have a fort theory of ecology built forts when they were kids and i don 't want to be the one to tell this kid who is on a special program that takes philadelphia kids from poor neighborhoods and takes them to city parks i don 't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he 's holding is a non native invasive weed that he should throw away i think i would much rather learn from this boy that no matter where this plant comes from it is beautiful and it deserves to be touched and appreciated thank"
