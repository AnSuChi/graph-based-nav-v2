  "transcript": "you 're standing on a street anywhere in america this is oak street that 's elm street blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets he leaves a little confused and disappointed so what is the name of this street they say oh well that 's block seventeen and this is block sixteen and you say ok but what is the name of this street blocks have names just look at google maps here there 's block fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks there 's block but walking around the neighborhood i noticed that the house numbers don 't go in order he says of course they do they go in the order in which they were built third is house number three it 's easy it 's obvious i love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn 't even know we had and realize that the opposite of them may also be true so for example there are doctors in china who believe it 's their job to keep you healthy so any month you are healthy you pay them and when you 're sick you don 't have to pay them because they failed at their job they get rich when you 're healthy not sick but in west african music the one is thought of as the end of the phrase like the period at the end of a sentence so you can hear it not just in the phrasing but the way they and this map is also accurate"
