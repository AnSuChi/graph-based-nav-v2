  "transcript": "over the last two decades india has become a global hub for software development and and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge you know led to considerable angst amongst in fact if you look at polls they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the west if you have read i suspect many of you have done so read the book by thomas friedman called the world is flat basically in his book you know this fear for free trade is in fact he says it 's innovation that will keep the west ahead of the developing world with the and the less sophisticated shall we say drudge work being done in the developing world what we were trying to understand was is this true could india become just like it 's become a global hub for back office services and software development if the indians are so bloody smart so initially when we started our research we went and met several executives and we asked them what do you think will india go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a they dismissed us they said you know what indians don 't do innovation the more polite ones said well you know indians make good software programmers and accountants but they can 't do the creative stuff and people said you know it 's nothing to do with indians it 's really the rule based education system in india that is responsible for killing all creativity microsoft intel so we started examining the r & d and innovation labs well interestingly what you find there is usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the r & d center as they may call it and more often than not it 's an indian i immediately said well but you could not have been educated in india right you must have gotten your education here and the right question is really can indians based out of india i think hyderabad you name it to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these and what we found was as we progressed in our research was ipods and viagras which is innovation for end some of you may have read the famous economist schumpeter he said innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed but it could also be new ways of producing products it could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries once you take this there 's no reason to but the innovation that is being done in india is and what we did was we called it invisible innovation the first type of invisible innovation out of india is what we call innovation for business customers which is led by the multinational corporations & d centers set up in india by multinational companies employing more than four hundred when you consider the fact that historically the r & d center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters or in the country of origin of that multinational company to have seven hundred and fifty r & d centers of multinational corporations in india when we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on they said we are working on global products which is the usual role role of a local r & d they were working on truly global products and companies like microsoft general electric philips have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their bangalore and hyderabad not where it was developed the other thing we were told then was yes but you know the kind of work that is coming out of the indian r & d center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the u s r & d centers so my coauthor phanish puranam who happens to be one of the smartest people i know said so he 's now comparing the patents of r & d centers in the u s with r & d centers in india of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the what he finds is is what we call forward citations how many times does a future patent what we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of there 's no difference in the forward citation rates of their indian subsidiaries versus their u s subsidiaries so that 's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of india the second kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call outsourcing innovation to indian companies where many companies today are contracting indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world for example in the pharma industry a lot of the molecules are being developed but you see a major part of that work is being sent to india for example they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new boeing seven hundred and eighty seven dreamliner one to avoid the third kind of invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call process because of an injection of intelligence by indian firms it 's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product but not a new product itself only in india what high school dropouts do what happens when you put and they start and they start telling the boss how to do this job better and out of this process innovation comes product innovations which are then marketed around the world for example you can guess or predict what this phone call is about it and the last kind of innovation invisible innovation coming out and the most significant management innovation to come it allows you to take previously send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists and then specify the means for reintegrating them without that you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today so what i 'm trying to say is what we are finding in our research is that if products for end users submerged portion now some implications and now i 'm going to go back to where i started my conversation with you now what happens is when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to india for innovation and for r & d work at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem which is where does the next step so you have two choices then either you bring the people from india into the developed world to take positions in the next step of the ladder immigration why don 't we move the next step to india what we are trying to say is and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that and the largest growth 's where the important market leadership is right and the last thing we point out in this slide which is you know that to this story there 's one caveat india has the youngest growing population in the world but paradoxically there 's also the mirage of mighty labor pools indian institutes and educational system with a few exceptions are incapable of producing so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure so finally i want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company ibm here is the profile of employees of in two thousand and three they had three hundred thousand employees or three hundred and thirty thousand employees out of which one hundred and thirty five thousand were in america nine thousand were in india in two thousand and nine they had four hundred thousand employees by which time the u s employees had moved to one hundred and five thousand whereas the indian employees had gone to one hundred thousand well so i had to make some estimates based on various sources here are my best guesses okay i 'm not saying this is the exact number it 's my best guess it gives you a sense of the trend there are four hundred and thirty three thousand people now at ibm or an indian company"
