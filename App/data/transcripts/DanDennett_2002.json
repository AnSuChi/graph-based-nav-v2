  "transcript": "and yet many darwinians are anxious a little uneasy would like to see some limits on just how far the darwinism goes beaver dams yes hoover dam no what do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves and yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to and so i 'm going to talk a little bit about that keeping in mind that we have a lot so you 're out in the woods or you 're out in the pasture and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass it climbs up to the top and it falls and it climbs and it falls and it climbs what is this ant doing what is this in aid of what goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass what 's in it for the ant and the answer is nothing there 's nothing in it for the ant well then it 's a lancet fluke it 's a little brain worm it 's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant crawl into its brain and drive it up a blade of grass like an all terrain vehicle so there 's nothing in it for the ant the ant 's brain has been hijacked pretty scary does anything like that happen with human beings it may already have occurred to you that islam means surrender or submission of to the will of allah it 's ideas not worms that hijack our brains now am i saying that a sizable minority of the world 's population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas no it 's worse than that most people have there are a lot of ideas to die for and many for catholicism and many for islam these are just a few they 're infectious and we might as well try to have a theory of what 's going on when that happens so that we hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is and you have to have a bumper sticker you know you have to have a this is mine the secret of happiness is find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it most of us now that the me decade is well in the past now we actually do this one set of ideas or another have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own this is what our summum bonum is it 's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have it 's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests and no other species does anything at all like it well how are we going to think about this it is on the one hand a biological effect and a very large one what theories do we want to use to look at this well many theories but how could something tie them together the idea of replicating ideas ideas invented the term memes and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book the and he 's not responsible for what i say about memes i 'm responsible actually i think we 're all responsible for not just the so it is important i think to richard and to me that these ideas not be and it 's just about a full time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another so we have to keep plugging away trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread but it is a problem we don 't have much time and i 'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out because there 's a lot of other things that are going to be said so let me just point out memes are like viruses that 's what richard said back in ' ninety three and you might think well how can that be i mean a virus is viral telecommunications but what 's a virus a virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude laughter that is there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does what 's a meme made of what are bits made of of information and what 's a word made of sometimes when people say do memes exist i say well do words exist are they in your ontology if they are words then there 's all the other memes that can 't be pronounced there are different species of memes beautiful furniture and of course they 're basically extinct now and one of the reasons is that among the is that one should be celibate not just the priests everybody well it 's not so surprising that they survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren 't there and there were lots of and they could keep it going and in principle it could 've gone on forever with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts so the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they 're not being passed on shaker dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite there are other parasites that do this which render the host it 's part of their plan i 'm just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective which i recommend i 've not time to go into jared diamond 's wonderful book guns germs and steel he talks about how it was germs more than guns and steel that conquered the new hemisphere the western hemisphere that conquered the rest of the world when european explorers and travelers spread out they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to that they had learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years thousands of years of and they just wiped out these pathogens just wiped out the native people who had no immunity to them at all we 're doing it this time with toxic a number of people nicholas negroponte and others spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out thanks to all the new technology all over the world and i agree it is largely wonderful largely wonderful but among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world now this has been realized for some time sayyid qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical islam one of the ideologues that inspired one has only to glance at its press films fashion shows beauty contests ballrooms wine bars and broadcasting stations memes these memes are spreading around the world and they are they are wiping out traditions and it 's not our fault anymore than it 's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven 't developed the immunity we have so we let pornography and all these things they 're not a big deal for us but we should recognize and we should be very alert to this as we spread our education and our technology one of the things that we are doing is we 're the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes the memes that they are prepared to die for well now how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes that is not the job of the science of memetics memetics is morally neutral and so it should be if you 've had a friend who 's died of aids then and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective"
