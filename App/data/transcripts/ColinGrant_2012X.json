  "transcript": "is a photograph of a man whom for many years i plotted to kill this is my father i dreamt of scraping off the poison from fly killer paper into his coffee loosening the carpet on the stairs so he would trip and break his neck he would always bow out of the house without so much as a swig of coffee or a bite to eat and so for many years i feared that my father would die before i had a chance to kill him up until our mother asked him to leave and not come back he teetered permanently on the verge of rage rather like me as you see he worked nights at vauxhall motors in luton and demanded total silence throughout the house so that when we came home from school at three thirty in the afternoon we would huddle beside the tv and rather like and at times when we were like this going on in the house that i imagined us to be like the german crew of a u boat creeping along the edge so that lesson was the lesson that do not draw attention to yourself either in the home or outside of the home maybe it 's a migrant lesson so there was no communication the sound that we most looked forward to you know when you 're a child and you want your father to come home and it 's all going to be happy and you 're waiting for that sound of the door opening well the sound that we looked forward to was the click of the door closing which meant he 'd gone and would not come back so for three decades laid eyes on my father nor he on me we never spoke to each other for three decades and then a couple of years ago i decided to turn the spotlight on him actually you are you are being watched that was his mantra to us his children time and time again he would say this to us and where he worked at vauxhall motors and he was a jamaican and what he meant was you child of a jamaican immigrant are being watched to see which way you turn to see whether you conform to the host nation 's stereotype of you of being feckless so confound their expectations of you to that end jamaican exhibited a kind of jamaican bella figura turn your best if you have seen some of the images of the caribbean people arriving in the ' 40s and ' 50s you might have noticed that a lot of the men wear they wanted to project themselves in a way that they wanted to be perceived so that the way they looked and the names that they gave themselves defined them so bageye is bald tidy boots is very fussy about his footwear anxious is always anxious clock has one arm longer than the other my all time favorite was the guy they called summerwear and in the course of researching their lives i asked my mom whatever became of summerwear taught us the importance of style maybe they exaggerated their style because they thought that they were not considered to be quite civilized and they transferred that generational attitude or anxiety onto us the next generation so much so that when i was growing up if ever on the television news or radio a report came up about a black person committing some crime a mugging murder a burglary we winced along with our parents you did not just represent yourself you represented the group and it was a terrifying thing to to come to terms with in a way that maybe you were going to be perceived in the so that was what needed to be challenged our father and many of his colleagues exhibited a kind of we were to keep quiet when our father did speak to us it was from the pulpit of his mind they clung to certainty in the belief that but when i after a day 's writing i rush downstairs and i 'm very excited to talk about marcus garvey or bob marley and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies and i 'm so excited that my children stop me and they say they cross over somehow they find their way to you they shape their lives according to the narrative of your life as and maybe bageye did with his father and that was clearer to me in the course of looking at his life they say the native americans say do not criticize the man until you can walk in his moccasins but in conjuring his life it was okay and very straightforward to portray a caribbean life in england in the with polystyrene ceiling tiles permanently sheathed in their transparent covers that they were delivered in and the old adage that with age comes wisdom is not true but what was true was that so listen to how i sound they determined that they would send me to a private school but my father worked at vauxhall motors it 's quite i remember going on to the school for the entrance my father said to the priest it was a catholic school he wanted a better never even managed to pass worms never mind entrance exams but in order to fund my education he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff so my father would fund my education by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car and that was made even more tricky because my and he never being a jamaican coming to this country he never had a driving license he never had any insurance or road tax or mot he thought i know how to drive why do i need the state 's validation he would promote the policeman immediately so that p c bloggs became detective inspector bloggs so my father was exhibiting what we in jamaica called playing fool to catch wise but it lent also an idea that actually he was being diminished or belittled by the policeman which is very striking very strange in a way because migrants are very courageous people they leave their homes my father and my mother left jamaica and they traveled four thousand miles and somewhere along the line the natural order was reversed the children became the parents to the parent the caribbean people came to this country with although there 's still the kind of but we children knew that the game was up i think there was a feeling that they would not continue with the ideals of the life that they expected the reality was very much different even in his absence that old mantra six times more than they ought to be i was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say black people are schooled in paranoia and i wonder what bageye would make of that and turned my attention to bageye and i went in search of him he was back in luton he was now eighty two and i hadn 't seen him for 30 odd years and he was and i 'd never seen him smile i was very disconcerted by that but we sat down and he had a talking some old time talk deep connection and i almost felt in the course of that reunion that i was auditioning to be my father 's son when the book came out it had fair reviews in the national papers but the paper of choice in luton is not the guardian it 's the luton news and the luton news ran the headline about the book the book that may heal a 32 year old rift and i understood that could also represent the rift between one generation and the next between people like me and my father 's generation but there 's no tradition in caribbean life of memoirs or biographies it was a tradition that you didn 't chat about your business in public but i and i thought actually yes there is a possibility that this will open up conversations that we 'd never had before and i even began to feel that this book may be perceived by my father as an act of filial was stung by what he perceived to be and he got it with the headline bageye bites back i was no son of his i grew to admire that stance there was still fire bubbling through his veins even though he was eighty two years old and if it meant that we would now return to thirty years of silence father would say if it 's so then it 's so jamaicans will tell you that there 's no such thing as facts there are only versions we all tell ourselves the versions of the story that we can best live with each generation builds up but in the writing and i lost and i felt free much freedness could be transferred to him i was struck by an idea that i had very few photographs nine months old in the original photograph bageye but when my parents separated my mother excised him from all aspects of our lives she took a pair of scissors and cut him out of every photograph you are unsupported but there 's another way of looking at this photograph this is a photograph that has the potential for a reunion i held him up to the light it was very awkward and tense moments and to lessen the tension he walked like a man on the losing side of the f a cup final thank you"
