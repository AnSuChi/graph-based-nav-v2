  "transcript": "i was on an evening out with friends to celebrate one of their birthdays we hadn 't been all together for a couple of weeks it was a perfect evening as we were all reunited i caught the last underground train back to the other side of london 10 minute walk home as i turned the corner onto my street my house in sight up ahead and the young man behind me dragged me kicking me in the back and neck while he began to assault me ripping off my clothes and telling me to shut up as i struggled to cry for help with each smack of my head to the concrete ground a question echoed through my mind that still haunts me today is this going to be how it all ends little could i have realized i 'd been followed the whole way from the moment i left the station having the cuts and bruises on my naked body photographed for forensic evidence now there are few words to describe the all consuming feelings of vulnerability shame upset and injustice that i was ridden with in that moment and for the weeks to come but wanting to find a way i wrote about it it i wrote a letter to my assaulter humanizing him as you to identify him as part of the very community that he had so violently abused effect of his actions i wrote did you ever think of the people in your life i 'm a pupil i 'm a cousin i 'm a niece i 'm a neighbor and all the people who form these relations to me up my community and you assaulted every single one of them you violated the truth that i will never cease to fight for and which all of these people represent that there are infinitely more good people in the world than bad but determined not to let this one incident make me lose faith in the solidarity in my community or humanity as a whole i recalled the seven i told my attacker you 've carried out your attack but now i 'm getting back on my tube my community will not feel we are unsafe walking home after dark we will get on last tubes home and we will walk up our streets alone because we will not ingrain or submit to the idea that we are putting ourselves in danger in doing so and this is a fight you will not win at the time of writing this letter thank you at the time of writing this letter i was studying for my exams in oxford and i was working on the local student paper there despite being lucky enough to have friends and family supporting me it was an isolating time i didn 't know anyone who 'd been through this before at least i didn 't think i did i 'd read news reports statistics and knew how common sexual assault was yet i couldn 't actually name a single person that i 'd heard speak out about an experience of this kind before i decided that i would publish my letter in the student paper hoping to reach out to others in oxford that might have had a similar experience and be feeling the same way at the end of the letter i asked others to write in with their experiences under the hashtag # notguilty to emphasize that survivors of assault could express themselves without feeling shame or guilt about what happened to them to show that we could all stand up to sexual assault soon we were receiving hundreds of stories from men and women across the world which we began to publish on a website i set up and the hashtag became a campaign date raped on a visit to london and wasn 't taken seriously by anyone he reported his case to i had personal facebook messages from people in india and south america saying how can we bring the message of the campaign there and i had friends open up to me about experiences ranging from those that happened last week to those that happened years ago that i 'd had no idea about and the more we started to receive these messages more we also started to receive messages of hope people feeling empowered by this community of voices standing up to sexual assault and victim blaming one woman called olivia after describing how she was attacked by someone she had trusted and cared about for a long time said i 've read many of the stories posted here and i feel hopeful that if so many women can move forward then i can too i and i hope i can be as strong as them someday i 'm sure i will people around the world began tweeting under this hashtag and the letter was republished and covered by but something struck me about the media attention that this letter was attracting and yet sexual assault is not something new along with other kinds of injustices is reported in the media all the time but through the campaign these injustices were framed as not just news stories they were firsthand experiences that had affected real people who were creating with the solidarity of others what they needed and had previously lacked a platform to speak out the reassurance they weren 't alone or to blame for what happened to them and open discussions that would help to reduce stigma around the issue the voices of those directly affected were at the forefront of the story we live in an incredibly interconnected world with the proliferation of social media which is of course a fantastic resource for igniting social change but it 's also made us increasingly reactive from the smallest annoyances of oh my train to the greatest injustices the problem with reacting in this manner en masse is it can sometimes mean that we don 't actually react at all not in the sense of actually doing anything anyway it might make ourselves feel better like we 've contributed to a group whose needs must be heard one british tabloid on the publication of my letter branded oxford student launches online campaign to shame attacker and some even accused me of feigning as if i 'm going to be like hey guys sorry i can 't make it i 'm busy trying to hate the entire male population by the time i 'm thirty laughter now i 'm almost sure that these people wouldn 't say the things they say in person but it 's as if because they might be behind a screen in the another main concern i have about this noise that escalates from our online responses to injustice is that it can very easily slip into portraying us as the affected party which can lead to a sense of defeatism a kind of mental barrier to seeing any opportunity for positivity or change after a negative situation a and i saw zelda la grange speak the former private secretary to nelson mandela one of the stories she told really struck me she spoke of when mandela was taken to court by the south african rugby union after he commissioned an inquiry into sports affairs in the courtroom he went up to the south african rugby union 's and zelda wanted to protest saying they had no right to his respect after this injustice they had caused him he turned to her and said you must never allow the enemy to determine the grounds for battle at the time of hearing these words i didn 't really know why they were so important but i felt they were and i wrote them down in a notebook i had on me revenge or the expression of hatred towards those who have done us injustice may feel like a human instinct in the face of wrong but we need to break out of these cycles if we are to hope to transform negative events of injustice into positive social change the perpetrators but i don 't want to discourage a social media response because i owe the development of the # notguilty campaign almost entirely to social media but i do want to encourage a more considered approach to the way we use it to respond firstly why do i feel this injustice in my case there were several answers to this someone had hurt me and those who i loved under the assumption they wouldn 't have to be held to account or recognize the damage they had caused yet it 's still a problem we don 't give the same airtime to as other issues it 's still an issue many people blame ask yourself how in recognizing these reasons could i go about reversing them opening up discussions amongst friends amongst families in the media that had been closed for too long and stressing that victims shouldn 't feel to blame for what happened to them still have a long way to go in solving this problem entirely because but this doesn 't mean we still can 't give them a considered response in situations where you can 't go about thinking how you 'd reverse this feeling of injustice you can still think maybe not what you can do but what you can not do and you can not react to injustice only to forget about it the next day just because the rest of twitter has moved on sometimes not reacting instantly is the best immediate course of action we can take but let 's consider our responses let us hold people to account without descending into a culture that thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves between criticism and let us not forget to think before we speak just because we might have a screen in front of us and when we create noise on social media let it not drown out the needs of those affected but instead let it amplify their voices so the internet becomes a place where you 're not the exception if you speak out about something that has actually happened to you all these considered approaches to injustice evoke the very keystones on which the internet was built to network because if you look up the word justice in the dictionary before punishment before administration of law or judicial authority you get the maintenance of what is right and i think there are few things more thank you very much"
