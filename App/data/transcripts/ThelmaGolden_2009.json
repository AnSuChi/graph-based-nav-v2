  "transcript": "wrote a volume called people who led to my plays and if i were to write a volume it would be called artists who have led my in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are j j from good times significant to many people of course because of dy no mite but perhaps more significant as the first really black artist on primetime primetime tv jean michel basquiat important to me because [ he was ] the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what i was about to enter into my overall project is about art specifically about black artists very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves my interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger world of art but who have created new places for us to see and understand i 'm showing two glenn ligon and kara walker two of many who really form for me the essential questions that i wanted to bring as a curator to the world i was interested in the idea of why and how i could create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world and to do this i knew that i had to see the way in which artists work understand the artist 's studio as a laboratory imagine then reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper asking questions providing the space to look and to think about answers when i was a curator at the whitney it looked at the intersection of race and gender it sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for dialogue complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view what was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is i was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people 's understanding of themselves i 'm showing you two works one on the right by leon golub one on the left in my sense of what art could be and she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was as it related for her to the idea of how black people had been represented and she pointed to the image on the right as an example to me of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media she then assigned these works racial identities basically saying to me that the work on the right bob colescott a white artist the point of that for me was to say in that space in that moment that i really wanted to understand how images could work how images did work and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day to day lives to work through these images really the place where the harlem renaissance existed sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards i always say harlem is an interesting community because unlike many other places it thinks of itself in the past present and the future it 's always what it was and what it can be and in thinking about that then my second project the second question i ask is can a museum be a catalyst in a community can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves this is harlem actually on january 20th thinking about itself in a very wonderful way so i work now at the studio museum what does this mean to some of you in some cases i know that many of you are involved in you 're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation in working with young black think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real catalysts the studio museum was founded in the late 60s and i bring this up because it 's important to locate to look at one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight in the incredible historic moment that it is and think of the arc that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the legacy of important african american artists to the history of art in this country like jacob lawrence norman lewis romare bearden muhammad ali gave a lecture at harvard university after his lecture a student got up and said to him give us a poem and mohammed ali said me we in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to define what might be black art cultural movement of the century what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment the me we seems incredibly prescient totally important to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an f which have set out to discover and define the young black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we define and redefine culture black culture specifically in my case but culture generally i named this group of artists around an idea which i put out there called post black looking back at history but start in it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i 'm asking this new set of questions is what does it mean right now to be where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine that their through the excitement of the community that they create as i am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don 't imagine it should be i am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work it is why i make exhibitions forty young artists done over the course of eight years and for me it 's about considering the implications it 's considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us it 's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the as their work travels but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us it 's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagining particularly in urban america about the nurturing of the spirit now where for me it is about re imagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project has been called flow with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world really looking not so much from harlem and out but looking across and flow looked at artists all born on the continent of africa and as many of us think about that continent and think about and imagining what they can tell us about the future what they tell us about our future and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue it has been what i 've discovered to talk and to talk and speak to each other that 's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world"
