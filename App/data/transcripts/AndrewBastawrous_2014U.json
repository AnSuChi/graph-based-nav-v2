  "transcript": "million people in the world who are blind eighty percent of them and the absolute majority do not need to be blind they are blind from diseases that are either completely we set up a hundred clinics throughout the great rift valley to try and understand a single question why are people going and what can we do when we got to where we were going we set up our high tech equipment because it 's the patients who are the most in need of access to eye care who are the least likely to get it and in so we said could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way which is bulky expensive and fragile smartphone apps and hardware that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age here we have a demonstration of a three month old having their vision accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker and through the lessons that we 've learned in the field we realized it 's extremely important to share the data in non medical jargon so that people understand so here for example we use our sight sim application once your vision has been measured to show carers and teachers what the visual world is like for that person so they can empathize with them and help them once we 've discovered somebody has low vision the next big challenge is to work out why and to traditionally this requires expensive equipment to examine an area called the retina the retina is the single part of the eye that has we 've developed which can then be clipped onto a and the beauty is anybody can do it in our trials on over two and half thousand people when we first moved to kenya we went with one hundred and fifty thousand dollars of equipment a team of fifteen people and that was what was needed to deliver health care now all that 's needed is a single person on a bike with a smartphone and it costs just five hundred dollars the issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar our healthcare workers travel with a solar powered rucksack which keeps the phone charged and backed up now we go to the patient rather than waiting for the patient never to come we go to them in their homes we can link global experts with people in the most rural project managers hospital directors are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in here in nakuru where i 've been living we can search each red pin depicts somebody and they 're locatable we can use bulk text messaging services to explain that we 're coming to arrange a treatment what 's more we 've learned that this is something that we haven 't built just for the community but with the community those blue pins that drop represent elders or local leaders that are connected to those people who can ensure this is something that has to happen it 's only in statistics that people go blind by the millions but now they might just be a text message away from help now because live demos are always a bad idea to try a live demo so here we have the peek vision app okay and what we 're looking at here this is sam 's optic nerve which is a direct extension of her brain so i 'm actually looking at her brain as we look there we can see all parts of the retina it makes it possible to pick up diseases of the eye and of the body and people can be cured of blindness and i think it says a lot about us as a human race if we 've developed cures and we don 't deliver them but now we can thank you"
