  "transcript": "i am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about we like it we like some parts of it the average american watches tv for almost five hours a day okay now i happen to make my living these days they in fact berate it they call it stupid and worse believe me my mother growing up she called it the idiot box so why i believe that television has a conscience is that i i actually believe now today we 're not talking about good and bad tv we 're talking about popular over the course of fifty years but how do these shows over fifty years reflect the idea of our social conscience how does television evolve over time now speaking of evolution from basic biology you probably remember you have power and you have the urge for acquisitiveness as humans what 's important to remember is that we 've developed we 've evolved over time to temper or tame these basic animal instincts the other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained we love to watch tv but they don 't love to watch had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious why has television entertainment evolved the way it has i kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders we surveyed the top 20 nielsen shows every year for fifty years a thousand shows we talked to over three thousand individuals almost three thousand six hundred aged eighteen and we asked them how they felt emotionally how did you feel watching every single one of these shows did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity did you feel outrage did you laugh what did this mean for you but as you can see these emotional need states are truly universal and on a factual basis over eighty percent of the are exported around the world so i really hope our global audiences can relate two acknowledgments before our first data slide for inspiring me to even think i thank legendary jack stern two things we 're going to start with the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state which for this purpose we defined inspiration as television shows that me that make me feel much more positive about the world as we start you see in one thousand nine hundred and sixty inspiration is holding steady that 's what we 're watching tv for moral ambiguity starts to climb right at the end of the 60s moral ambiguity is going up inspiration is kind of on the wane why watergate but look it can 't aids the challenger disaster chernobyl moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from one thousand nine hundred and ninety for the next twenty years take a look at this but in this case we have comfort the bubble in red on tv you have bonanza don 't forget you have gunsmoke you have andy griffith you have domestic shows all about comfort this is rising comfort stays whole irreverence starts to rise social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up you get to one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine and look what but you literally have two establishment shows gunsmoke and gomer pyle in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine are the the socially irreverent hippie show rowan and martin 's laugh in they 're all living together right viewers had responded dramatically look at this green spike in when you guys hear this industry term a breakout hit what does that mean it means in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty six television season the smothers brothers came out of nowhere i can comment on how i feel about the the dam bursts comfort is no longer why we watch television social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s now look at this the 70s means who norman seven of ten shows ranked most highly for irreverence five of the top 10 during the nixon administration only one generation twenty years in and we discovered wow tv can do that it can make me feel this it can change us so to this very very savvy crowd i also want to note archie bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us years ago this is a quick chart here 's another attribute fantasy and imagination which are shows defined as takes me out of my everyday realm and makes me feel better that 's mapped against the red dot unemployment which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic you 'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise it maps to a spike in unemployment do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed no in you have the bellwether show the bionic woman that rocketed into the because this is our last twenty years you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three camera sitcom and the rise 90s the big bubbles of humor we 're watching friends frasier cheers and seinfeld everything 's good x marks the spot in two thousand and one the september two thousand and one television season humor succumbs to judgment we had the bursting of the tech bubble anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon look what happens when we keep going the internet takes off reality television has taken hold what do people want in their tv then would have thought revenge so as dramatically different as these television shows pure entertainment have been over the last fifty years what did i start with we 're animals we need our moms there has not been a decade of television without a definitive dominant tv mom the 1950s june cleever in the original comfort show leave it to beaver lucille ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the the epitome of the irreverent 1970s who tackled abortion divorce even menopause on tv the 1980s our first cougar was given to us in the form of alexis carrington murphy brown took on a vice president when she bree the men of tedwomen the global audiences of tedwomen thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television but let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens but it 's you as viewers through your collective social consciences that give it life longevity power or not so thanks very much"
