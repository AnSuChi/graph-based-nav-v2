  "transcript": "good evening my journey to this stage began when i came to america at the age of seventeen each of us has a dream when we come here a dream that usually has to be rewritten and always has to be repurposed training immigrants to run for public office and leading a movement for inclusive democracy but i don 't want you to think it was a cakewalk that america opened its arms wide and welcomed me it 's still not doing that the world 's largest democracy the world 's greatest democracy i came because i wanted to study english literature and i thought why not make a living doing that as an adult but after i graduated from college and got a graduate degree maybe it was the optimism that i had about america that made me take a while to understand that things were not going to change the door that i thought was open was actually just slightly ajar this door of america that would open wide if you had the right but could just slam in your face and i just couldn 't accept that so i started a career as a starting an organization for young people like myself i was young at the time that i started it who traced their heritage to the indian subcontinent i lobbied members of congress on policy issues and i couldn 't run for office so in two thousand when it was announced that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double from ninety five dollars to two hundred and twenty five dollars i decided it was time to apply before i could no longer afford it i filled out a long application answering questions about my current and once the application there were fingerprints to be taken a test to study for endless hours of waiting in line you might call it extreme vetting and then in december of two thousand i joined hundreds of other immigrants in a hall in brooklyn where we pledged our loyalty to a country that we had long long considered home my journey from international student to american citizen took sixteen years a short timeline and soon after i had taken that formal step to becoming an american the attacks of september eleven two thousand and one changed the immigration landscape for decades to come my city new york city was reeling and healing and in the midst of it we were in an election cycle two things happened as we coped with loss and recovery in new york city we also adopted by ballot referendum the newly elected mayor i want you to come back to that time i was a young immigrant woman from belize i had basically floundered in various jobs in america before i started a community based organization the attacks of september eleven sent shock waves through my community people who were members of my family i was going to represent their concerns in government no job felt more perfect for me and here are two things i learned when i became commissioner first new yorkers who were in city government holding government positions had no idea how scared immigrants were of and most of us when we see someone in uniform going through our neighborhoods send them off to school and go to work you don 't know what the chances are that you 're going to see them at the end of the day because a raid at your workplace the second thing i learned is that when people like me who understood that fear we advocated for our communities ' needs in a way that no one else could i understood what that feeling of fear was like but also by their teachers my husband then boyfriend thought twice before he put a backpack on or grew a beard because he traveled so much voices and vantage points that i think can help make our democracy stronger we actually have the power to change the outcome of elections to introduce new issues into the policy debate and to change the face so how do we do that but it might surprise you to know that one in three voters are black latino or asian but here 's the thing it doesn 't just matter who can vote it matters who does vote so in two thousand and twelve half of the latino and asian american they matter in local and state elections in ran for a seat in the san jose city council he lost that election by thirteen votes he dusted off those campaign shoes and went back to run for that seat and this time he won by twelve votes they can make a difference we need those voices we need those voices in part because american leadership does not there are over five hundred thousand local and state offices in america fewer than two percent of those offices are held by asian americans or latinos the two largest immigrant groups in our country in the city of yakima washington of the population is latino there has never been a latino on the city council three newly elected latinas mndez she is a first generation college student she grew up partly in colima mexico and partly in yakima washington she 's a single mother a community advocate her voice on the yakima city council but the third most untapped resource in american democracy we have come for economic and educational opportunity we have come in the pursuit of love that dedication that commitment to america we also bring to public service people like athena salman who just last week won the primary for a seat in the arizona state house where he met her mother athena when she gets to the statehouse is going to fight for things like education funding that will help give families like hers a leg up so they can achieve the financial stability that we all looking for immigrants ' votes voices and vantage points we never know what putting a new factor into an equation will and it 's a little scary you and i 'm scared that i 'm never going to get a place at the table i 'm scared you 're going to take it away from me and you 're scared i 'm going to take it away from you look it 's been a rough election year but i have fought to be in this country and i continue to do so every day so my optimism never wavers behind me and all around me it 's our country"
