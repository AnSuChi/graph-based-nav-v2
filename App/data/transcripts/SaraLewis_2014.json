  "transcript": "i think jason webley last night called it conspiring to be part of the magic so it 's fortunate that my career as a biologist lets me dive deeply into the lives of some truly wondrous creatures that share our planet summertime even other ted talks something like this my seduction into the world of fireflies began when i was back in graduate school and suddenly these silent sparks rose up all around me i 've been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as i 've explored this nocturnal world now if you 've ever seen then you 'll know how magically they can transform our everyday landscape into something ethereal and otherworldly and this happens around the globe like this hillside in the smoky mountains that i saw transformed into a living cascade of light floating flashes of these genji all blinking together in stunning synchrony and they keep me connected to the magic and i find it amazing that they 're created by these tiny insects in they 've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries as i 've traveled around the world i 've met many thoughtful people who have told me that god put fireflies on earth for humans to enjoy i think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so beautifully illuminate the struggle for reproductive opportunity as a firefly junkie the past twenty years have been quite an exciting ride so today i 'd like to share with you just a couple of tales that we 've brought back from our collective adventures into this hidden and these have evolved remarkably diverse courtship signals that is different ways to find and attract mates the very first fireflies probably looked like this they flew during the daytime and they didn 't light up instead males used their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females they are attractively plump so every night they climb up onto perches and they glow brightly for hours to attract their flying but unlit males here in north america we have more than one hundred different kinds of firefly that have the remarkable ability to shine energy out from their bodies in the form of light how do they do that which in the course of evolution has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms around an even smaller molecule called luciferin in the process getting it so excited that it actually gives off light could these bright lights have benefited some to answer this question we need to flip back in the family album to some they spend the vast majority of their lifetime up to two years in this larval form their main goal here like my teenagers and firefly light first originated in these juveniles every single firefly larva can light up even when their adults can 't but what 's the point to being so conspicuous well we know that these juveniles make so we think these lights first evolved as a warning a neon sign that says toxic stay away to any would be predators driven now by sexual selection some adult fireflies like this proud male evolved a shiny new glow in the dark lantern and now so we can follow this male out into the field as he joins hundreds of other males who are all showing off their new courtship signals it 's amazing to think that the luminous displays we admire here and in fact everywhere around the world are actually the silent love songs of male fireflies they 're flying and flashing their hearts out i still find it very romantic but meanwhile where are all the females well they have plenty of males to choose from and these females turn out to be very picky when a female sees a flash and give him a flash back they 'll strike up a conversation these creatures speak their love in the language of light we decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls to find out when we tested females using blinking led lights we discovered they prefer males who give males their sex appeal now we get to see what happens when the lights go out the first thing we discovered is that once a male and female hook up like this they stay together all night long while they 're mating the male is busy giving the female not just his sperm but also a package called a nuptial gift we can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair we can actually see the gift it 's shown here in red as it 's being passed from the male to the female what makes this gift so valuable is that it 's packed with protein that the female will use to provision her eggs we discovered that females use male flash signals to try to predict which males have the biggest gifts to offer because this bling helps the female lay more eggs and ultimately launch more of her own offspring into the next generation so it 's not all sweetness and light firefly romance is risky for the most part these adult fireflies don 't get eaten because like their juveniles they can manufacture toxins that are repellent to birds and other insectivores somewhere along the line one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins has driven these fireflies to take their bright lights out into the night with treacherous intent so the hunt begins with the predator she 's shown here in the lower left where she 's sitting quietly and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation of her intended prey and here 's how it might go first so then he flashes again but this time the predator sneaks in a reply if she 's she slowly this male unable to make their own toxins these females resort to drinking the blood of other fireflies the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive are giving way to development and to sprawl but in the process we spill so much extra light out into the night that it disrupts the lives of other creatures and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution because it obscures the signals that they use to find their mates yet every time a species is lost it 's like extinguishing a room full of candles one by one you might not notice when the first few flames flicker out but in the end you 're left sitting in darkness as we work together thank you"
