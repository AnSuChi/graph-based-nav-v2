  "transcript": "the pace of life is often frantic our minds are always busy and we 're always doing something so with that in mind i 'd like you just to take a moment to think when did you last take any time to do nothing just ten minutes and when i say nothing i do mean nothing so that 's no emailing texting no internet no tv no chatting no eating no reading simply doing i see a lot of very blank faces probably have to go a long way back and this is an extraordinary thing right we 're talking about our mind the mind that we rely upon to be happy emotionally stable as individuals and at the same time to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others this is the same mind that we depend upon to be spontaneous and to perform at our very best in everything that we do and yet we don 't take any time out to look after it in fact we spend more time looking after our cars our clothes and our hair than we okay maybe not our hair but you know the mind whizzes away like a and we don 't really know how to deal with that and the sad fact is that we are so distracted that we 're no longer present in the world in which we live we miss out on the things that are most important the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes that 's the way life is so we 've just kind of got to get on with it that 's really not how it has to be so i was about eleven when i went along to my first meditation class but my mom was going and i was intrigued so i went along with her i 'd also seen a few kung fu movies and secretly i kind of thought i might be now i guess like a lot of people i assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind you get stressed you do some meditation i hadn 't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature until i was about twenty when a number of things happened in my life in quite quick succession really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden i was inundated with thoughts inundated with difficult emotions that i didn 't know how to cope with every time i sort of pushed one down another one would pop back up again it was a really very stressful time i guess we all deal with some people will bury themselves in work grateful for the the distraction others will turn to their friends their family some people hit the bottle start taking medication i headed off to the himalayas i became a monk and i started studying meditation becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things but it was more than that it taught me it gave me a greater appreciation an understanding for the present moment by that i mean not being but instead learning how to be in the here and now how to be mindful how to be present and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it 's anything but ordinary there was a research paper that came out of harvard just recently that said on average our minds are lost in thought almost this sort of constant mind wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness now but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought when there 's a positive practical achievable scientifically proven technique and the beauty of it is that even though but we need to know how to do it we need an exercise we need a framework to learn how to be more mindful that 's essentially what meditation is it 's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment but we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it and that 's what these are for in case you 've been wondering because most people assume getting rid of emotions somehow controlling the mind but actually 's quite different from that it 's more about stepping back witnessing it coming and going emotions coming and going without judgment so for example right now if i focus too much on the balls then there 's no way i can relax and talk to you at the same time equally if i relax too much talking to there 's no way i can focus on the balls i 'm going to drop them and in meditation there 'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense and life starts to feel a bit like this it 's a very uncomfortable way to live life when you get this tight and stressed at other times we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much and things just become a sort of little bit like this of course in meditation so we 're looking for a balance a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement now what usually happens when we 're learning to be mindful is that we get distracted by a thought let 's say this is an anxious thought everything 's going fine and we see the anxious thought oh i didn 't realize i was worried about that this is crazy we do this all the time even on an everyday level if you think about but what do you and we do it all the time and it 's only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go you might see many different patterns you might find a mind that 's really restless and the whole time don 't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that sleep get up or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round offers the opportunity the potential to step back and to get a different perspective to see that things aren 't always we can 't change but we can change the way that we experience it that 's the potential of meditation of mindfulness and you definitely don 't have to sit on the floor all you need to do is to take ten minutes out a day to step back to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus calm and clarity in your life thank you very much"
