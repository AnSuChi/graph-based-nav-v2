  "transcript": "like to talk with you about something that should be a totally uncontroversial topic but unfortunately it 's become incredibly controversial this year if you think about it over a billion couples will have sex with one another couples like this one even this one and my idea is this and they should be able to use one of these birth control methods to act on their decision now i think you 'd have a hard time finding many people who disagree with this idea over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all they want the power to plan their own lives better educated and more prosperous families but for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private birth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public which it 's not some people let 's be honest they 're uncomfortable with the topic because it 's about sex some people worry that the real goal of family planning is to control populations these are all side issues that have attached themselves to this core idea that men and women should be able to decide and as a result birth control has almost completely and totally disappeared from the global health agenda the victims of this paralysis are the people of sub saharan africa and south asia but let 's compare that to other places like uttar pradesh if uttar pradesh was its own country it would be the fifth largest country chad two percent let 's just take one country in africa but why is it so low one reason is that the most popular contraceptives are rarely available they get it in their arm and they go about four times the reason women like it so much in africa is they can hide it from their husbands the problem is every other time a woman goes into a clinic in senegal that injection is stocked out sometimes leaves her children and she doesn 't know when it 's going to be available again this is the same story across the continent of africa today and so what we 've created as a world has become a hundred thousand women [ per year ] who say they don 't want to be pregnant and they die in childbirth one hundred thousand women a year there are another six hundred thousand women [ per year ] who say they didn 't want to be pregnant in the first place and they give birth to a baby and her baby dies in that first month of life and we we have to be really clear about what our agenda is we we 're not talking about population control what i 'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives to save their now so many children today die of diarrhea as you heard earlier and we also need to help small farmers farmers who plow who plow small plots of land in africa but one of the simplest and most transformative things we can do is to give everybody access to birth control methods that almost all germans have access to and all and i think as long as we 're really clear about what our agenda is there 's a global movement waiting to happen and ready to get behind this totally uncontroversial idea myself a practicing catholic my mom 's was a jesuit priest my i was very close to her and i went to catholic schools for my entire childhood until i left home to go the nuns made service and social justice a high priority in the school i believe i 'm applying the lessons that i learned in high school the nuns also taught us to question received teachings and one of the teachings that we girls and my peers questioned was is birth control really a sin because i think one of the reasons we have this huge discomfort talking about contraception is this lingering concern that if we separate sex from and i think that 's a reasonable question to be asked about contraception what is its impact on sexual morality i wanted to go to college i studied really hard in they had sacrificed a lot but they said as i left home and i literally went down the front steps down the porch at home and they said if you decide to get married and have kids right away that 's ok by us too they wanted me to do the thing that would make me the very happiest i was free to decide what that would be it was an amazing feeling i did want to have kids bill and i have three and when our eldest and it 's no accident that we have three children that are spaced three years apart i want them to feel the way i did like they can do anything they want do in life and so what has struck me as i 've travelled the last decade for the foundation around the world is that all women want that same thing in one called korogocho which standing shoulder to shoulder and i spoke with this women 's group that 's pictured here and the women talked very openly about their family life in the slums what it was like and they talked quite intimately about what they did for birth control she said want to bring every good thing to this child before i have another and i thought that 's it but what 's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing so many women suffer from domestic even many of the women who do have knowledge and do have power don 't have access to contraceptives for two hundred and fifty around the world have been deciding to have smaller families this trend has been steady for a quarter of a millennium across cultures and across geographies the french started bringing down their family size in the and over the next one hundred and fifty years this trend spread all across europe the surprising thing to me as i learned this history was that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines people who spoke the same language made that change as a group they made the same choice for their family whether they were rich or whether they were poor that trend toward smaller families spread was that this whole way was driven by an idea the idea that couples can exercise conscious control over how many children they have it means that parents have the ability to affect the future not just accept it as it is the average family size went down every decade for one hundred and fifty years in a row until it stabilized weren 't that good in germany this transition started and it took just fifty years for family size to stabilize in this country and in asia and latin america the transition started in the 1960s and it happened much faster because of modern contraception it 's because some family programs resorted to unfortunate incentives and coercive policies for instance in the 1960s india adopted very specific numeric targets and they paid women to accept having an iud placed in their bodies indian women were really and so what did they do they waited a few hours or a few days and they went to another service provider and had the iud removed for one rupee for decades in the united states the procedure was so common it became known as the mississippi appendectomy and as recently as the 1990s in peru women from the andes region were given anesthesia and they were sterilized without their knowledge the most startling thing about this is that these coercive policies weren 't even needed they were carried out in places where parents already wanted to lower their family size because in region after region again and again parents have wanted to have smaller families there 's no reason to believe that african women have innately different desires they will have fewer children or are we going to condemn them to some as if this was still revolutionary france and the best method was coitus interruptus empowering parents it doesn but here 's the thing our desire to bring every good thing to our children is a force for good throughout the world it 's what propels societies forward and she was making backpacks out of her home she and her young kids would go to the local jeans factory and collect scraps of denim she 'd create these backpacks and resell them and so when i asked she was incredibly optimistic about her family 's future this is the same mental calculus that hundreds of millions of men and women have gone through and evidence proves that they have it exactly right in bangladesh there 's a district called matlab it 's where researchers have collected data on over one hundred and eighty thousand inhabitants since one thousand nine in the global health community we like to say it 's one of the longest pieces of research that 's been running we have so many great health statistics in one of the studies what did they do half the villagers were chosen to get contraceptives they got education and access the families were healthier the women were less likely to die in childbirth their children were less likely to die in the first thirty days of life the children were better nourished the adult women 's wages were higher households had more assets things like livestock or land or savings finally their sons and daughters had more schooling so when you multiply these types of effects over millions of families the product can be economic development people but it wasn 't really a miracle one of the leading causes of economic growth across that region was this cultural trend towards smaller families sweeping changes start at the individual family level the family making a decision about what 's best for their children when they make that change and that decision those become sweeping regional and national trends trends i think the goal here is really clear universal access to birth control that women want we can do our part this room and globally by talking about the hundreds of millions of families that don 't have access to contraception today and what it would do to change their lives if they did have access i think if marianne and the members of her women 's group can talk about this openly and have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public and where is the controversy in that so melinda in the last few years i 've heard a lot of smart people say something to the effect of we don 't need to worry about the population issue anymore family sizes are coming down naturally all over the the world we 're going to peak at nine or ten billion and that 's it and we need to look at it from the ground upwards i think that 's one of the reasons we got ourselves in so much trouble on this issue of contraception we looked at it from top down and said we want to have different population numbers over time about the planet yes we need to make the right choices but the choices have to be made at the family level and it 's only by giving people access and letting them choose what to do that you get those sweeping changes that we have seen globally except for sub saharan africa and those places in south asia and afghanistan ca some people on the right in america and in many conservative cultures around the world might say something like this it 's all very well to talk about saving lives and empowering women and so on but and that is wrong and it 's sacred in the united states and it 's sacred in france and so many places around the world and the fact that ninety eight percent of women in my country who are sexually experienced say they use birth control doesn 't make sex any less sacred it just means that they 're getting to make choices about their lives and i think in that choice we 're also honoring the sacredness of the family and the sacredness of the mother 's life and the childrens ' lives by saving their lives to me that 's incredibly sacred too ca so what is your foundation doing to promote this issue and what could people here and people listening on the web what would you like them to do mg i would say this join the conversation we 've listed the website up join the conversation tell your story about how contraception has either changed your life or somebody 's life that you know and say that you 're for this we need a groundswell of people saying this makes sense we 've got to give all women access no matter where they live and one of the things that we 're going to do is do a large event july july eleven in london with a whole host of countries a whole host of african nations to all say we 're putting this back on the global health agenda we 're going to commit resources to it to do planning from the bottom up with governments to make sure that women are educated so that if they want the tool they have it and that they have lots of options available either through their local healthcare worker or their local community rural clinic ca melinda i 'm guessing that some of those nuns who taught you at school are going to see this ted talk cheering you on mg i know they 're going to see the ted talk because they know that i 'm doing it and i plan to send it to them and you know the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive i hope that they 'll be very proud of me for living out what they taught us about social justice and service i have come to feel incredibly passionate about this issue because of what i 've seen in the developing world and yet they shouldn 't be they should have a voice they should have access and so i hope they 'll feel that i 'm living out what i 've learned from them and from the decades of work that i 've already done at the foundation ca so you and your team brought together today an i learned so many things i have so many follow up questions and i think a lot of this work is a journey you heard the discussion about the journey through energy or the journey through social design or the journey in the coming and saying why aren 't there any women on this platform and i think for all of us who work on these development issues you learn by talking to other people you learn by doing you learn by trying and making mistakes and it 's the questions you ask sometimes it 's the questions you ask that helps lead to the answer the next person that can help you answer it so i have lots of questions for the panelists from today and i thought it was just an amazing day ca melinda thank you for inviting all of us on this journey with you"
