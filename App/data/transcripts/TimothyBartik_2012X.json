  "transcript": "in this talk today i want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment it 's a different idea because usually when people talk about early childhood programs they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of but what i want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development that 's actually crucial and state governments are going to have to step up so we have to appeal to them the legislators in the state government and turn to something they understand that they have to promote the economic development i don 't mean anything magical all i mean is is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state 's residents now i think it 's fair to say that when people think about state and local economic they don 't generally think first about i know this i 've spent most of my career researching these programs i 've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues a lot of legislators about these issues property tax abatements so for example states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants they hand out all kinds of business tax breaks now those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions and the way they can make sense is by creating more and better jobs they raise employment rates raise per capita earnings of state residents so there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they 're paying by paying for these business tax breaks my argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do you build it you invest in high quality preschool it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around and in turn that higher quality local workforce will be a key driver if you look at the research evidence that 's extensive on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment wages and skills you take those known effects you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out and you take research on how much skills you will conclude the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and a three to one return now you can get much higher returns of up to former preschool participants who move to some other state one objection you often hear or maybe you don 't hear it because people are too polite to say it is why should i pay more taxes and the trouble with that objection it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent specifically the interdependency here is is that there are huge spillovers of skills that when other people 's children get more skills that actually increases the prosperity of everyone including people whose skills numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas it 's not so much low taxes low cost low wages so when you look for example at metropolitan areas such as the boston area these areas are not doing well economically because they 're if you ever tried to buy a house in silicon valley it 's not exactly a low cost proposition they are growing because so when we invest in other people 's children and build up those skills we increase the overall job growth of a metro area as another example if we look at what determines an individual 's wages and we do statistical exploration of that what determines wages we know that the individual 's wages will depend in part on that individual 's education for example whether so specifically if you hold constant your education you stick in percentage of college graduates in your you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all in fact this effect is so strong so if someone gets a college degree you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars that 's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills my employer is going to be less productive they will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages even if everyone at my firm has good skills if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills the firm that 's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages and then particularly in they 're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses so clearly the productivity of firms in silicon valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm if we can invest in other people 's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high quality we not only help those children we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we 'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth so you know maybe ohio 's thinking about investing in more preschool education for and maybe michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in ann arbor michigan and be worried these little wolverines will end up moving to ohio and becoming buckeyes and so they 'll both underinvest because everyone 's going to move out is if you look at the data americans aren people sometimes assume the data is that over sixty percent of americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in over sixty percent that percentage does not vary much from state to it doesn 't vary much over time so they will stay or at least enough of them will stay if run in a pay off in higher adult skills there 's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy and there 's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar so one obvious barrier is cost so if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four full day preschool at age four the total annual national cost would be roughly thirty billion dollars so thirty billion dollars is a lot of money on the other hand if you reflect on that the u s ' s population is over three hundred million we 're talking about an amount of money that amounts to one hundred dollars hundred dollars per capita per person is something that any state government can afford to do it 's just a simple matter of political will to do it and if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something what we 're talking about is that for the average low income kid that would increase earnings by about ten percent over their whole career k 12 or anything else after that not doing anything with college tuition or access just directly improving preschool and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle class so this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state 's population and produces large and tangible i actually think the more profound barrier is the long term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs so the argument i 'm making is is that we 're increasing the quality of our local workforce and obviously if we have a preschool with four year olds we 're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops right at least i hope not so we 're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off and of course america is notorious for being a short term oriented society now one response you can make to this and i sometimes have done this in talks is people can talk about there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs there are benefits parents care about preschool maybe we 'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool and i think those are ultimately this is something we 're investing in now for the future and so what i want to leave you with are we as americans are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long term future but our community are we still capable of that as a country and that 's something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves is that something that you are still invested in that you still believe in the notion of investment that is the notion of investment you sacrifice now for a return later so i think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is the moral and political choice is still up to us as citizens and as voters"
