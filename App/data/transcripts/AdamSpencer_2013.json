  "transcript": "or as i like to say hello ladies didn 't get much sexier than the spence at university let me tell you it is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from sydney australia to be here on the ted stage literally on the other side of the world and i wanted to let you know a lot of the things you 've heard about australians are true from the youngest of ages we display a prodigious sporting talent on the field of battle we are and noble warriors what you 've heard is true australians we don 't mind a bit of a drink sometimes to excess leading to embarrassing social situations this is my father 's work christmas party december i 'm almost five years old fair to say i 'm enjoying the day a lot more than santa was but i stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host not as a comedian but as someone who was is and always will be a mathematician i cast my mind back when i was in second grade and as we came up towards lunchtime our teacher what do you want to do after lunch i 've got no plans it and i am all for democratic schooling but we were only seven and after a while someone made a particularly silly suggestion and ms russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism that wouldn 't work that 'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole and i quote surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle well the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole it 'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop wouldn 't it and there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates until sitting next to me one of my friends one of the cool kids in class steven leaned across and punched me really hard in the head now what steven was saying was look adam you are at a critical juncture in your life here my friend you can keep sitting here with us any more of that sort of talk you 've got to go and sit over there with them i fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages i explained it it 's natural it 's everywhere numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written i want to show you one of those musical notes a number so beautiful massive i think it will blow your mind today we 're going to talk about prime numbers most of you i 'm sure remember that six is not prime because it 's two x three seven is prime the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties another thing about primes there is no final biggest prime number they keep going on forever we know there are an infinite number of primes due to the brilliant mathematician euclid over thousands of years ago he proved that for us don 't freak out never understood in the first place so two ^ five i won 't go into great detail as to why because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if i do suffice to say a number of that form is fairly easy to test for primacy a random odd number is a lot harder to test but as soon as we go hunting for massive primes we realize it 's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power one = two thousand and forty seven and you don 't need me to tell you prime numbers after that point they thin out a lot and one of the things about the search for massive primes that i love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search this is the great swiss mathematician leonhard euler 1700s other mathematicians said he is simply the master he was so respected they put him on european currency back when that was a compliment euler discovered at the time the world 's biggest prime two he proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill ink paper and his mind but he didn 't know what the factors were we knew it was like six but we didn 't know what are the two x three that multiply together to give us that massive number we didn 't know for almost forty years until frank nelson cole came along and started writing out the powers of two sixteen come on join in with me you know how it goes he took away one and wrote that number on the board a frisson of excitement went around the room it got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format and for the rest of the hour of his talk frank nelson cole busted that out he had found the prime factors of two the room went berserk it took him by his estimate years of sundays these are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade each one dwarfing the one before as computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew this is the largest prime number we a very emotional year for me it was a tough decision i loved university my arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life but i came to a realization about my own ability put simply in a room full of randomly selected people i 'm a maths genius in a roomful of maths ph ds i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers my skill is not in the mathematics it is in telling the story of the mathematics each one dwarfing the last until curtis cooper who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime and then curtis cooper got it back days ago in an amazing moment of serendipity i had to send ted a new slide i still remember i still remember when it happened i was doing my breakfast radio show i looked down on twitter there was a tweet adam have you seen the new largest prime number i shivered they currently the largest prime number we know is two eight hundred and this number is almost seventeen and a half if you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file that 's this is the first harry potter novel this is all seven harry potter novels because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end written out as a book it would have taken five hours to show you that number that 's the way and we know it is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime and who am i kidding when i say almost i know what you 're thinking we 're happy and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy is a remarkably simple question to ask it 's got a remarkably clear yes no answer and just requires phenomenal grunt but secondly as curtis cooper was looking for that monster prime he wasn 't the only guy searching my laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large the discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling rna sequences in searching through data from seti and other astronomical projects we live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but for me it 's amazing because it 's a metaphor for the time in which we live when human minds and machines can conquer we 've heard a lot about robots in this ted we 've heard a lot about what they can and can 't do it is true you can now download onto your smartphone an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess you think that 's cool here 's a machine doing something cool this is the cubestormer ii it can take a randomly shuffled it can examine the cube and solve the cube in five seconds i was asked in an interview last year in my capacity as a lower case c celebrity in australia what was your highlight of two thousand and twelve it wasn 't my highlight of two thousand and twelve people thought it might have been an interview i 'd done on my show it might have been a politician it might have been a breakthrough it might have been a book i read the arts no no no it might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done no it wasn 't the highlight of two thousand and twelve so clearly was the discovery of the higgs boson give it up for the fundamental particle that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass and what was so gorgeous about this discovery was fifty years ago peter higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions how is it that where does it come from and he postulated a suggestion that there 's this infinite the rest of the scientific community said we 've got no idea if we could ever prove it it 's beyond our reach and within just fifty years we had designed the greatest machine ever to prove this incredible idea that originated and we went and found it that is the essence of being human that is what we are all about or as my friend descartes might put it we think"
