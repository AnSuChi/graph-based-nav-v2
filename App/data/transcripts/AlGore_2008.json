  "transcript": "i have given i 'm giving a short slide show this morning that i 'm giving for because i 've cobbled this together to try to to meet the the challenge of this session and i was reminded by karen armstrong 's fantastic presentation that perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism how dare we be optimistic optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief an intellectual posture as mahatma gandhi famously said you must become the change you wish to see in the world and the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic except to the extent that the belief i 'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids and tipper and i put thirty three solar panels on our house and dug the geothermal wells and did all of that and when we change our in our daily lives we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part in order to be optimistic about this we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy we have to solve the democracy crisis i have been trying to tell this story for a long time i was reminded of that recently by a woman who walked past the table i was sitting at just staring at me as she walked past she was in her 70s looked like she had a kind face and so i said how do you do and she said you know if you dyed your hair black you would look just like al gore many years ago when i was a young congressman i spent and the military historians taught me during that quest that military conflicts are typically local battles and the rare but all important global world war strategic conflicts each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources a different approach a different organizational model but there are also regional environmental like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast and from western europe to the arctic but the climate crisis is the rare but all important global or strategic and we have to organize our response but the political will has to be mobilized in order to mobilize the resources i thought i would start with the logo what 's missing here of course is the north polar ice cap greenland remains this is what the polar ice cap the north polar ice cap looked like at the end of the summer at the fall and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate this is what 's happened in the last twenty eight years to put it in perspective here 's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers the north polar ice cap is the same size geographically doesn 't look quite the same size but it is exactly the same size as the united states minus an area roughly equal to the extra amount that disappeared last fall the amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years that puts a lot of pressure on greenland already around the arctic circle the snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of california they were the best of times they were the worst of times the most famous opening sentence in english literature i want to share briefly a tale of two planets earth and venus are exactly the same size earth 's diameter is about four hundred kilometers larger but but the difference deposited in the ground as the difference is that our temperature is fifty nine degrees on average now briefly here 's an image you 've seen as one of the only old images but i show it because i want to briefly give you scientific community says and so the compromise was more than ninety percent if it 's more coming in if it 's more being trapped on the way out then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here here is the lower atmosphere here 's the good news sixty eight percent of americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming there has been progress but here global warming is still listed at near the bottom what is missing is a sense of urgency if you agree with the factual analysis but you don 't feel the sense of urgency where does that leave the alliance for climate protection which i head in conjunction with current tv who did this pro bono did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this this is the winner on i 'll show all of the networks here the top journalists for nbc asked nine hundred and fifty six questions in two thousand and seven of the presidential candidates two of them were about the climate this is gasoline consumption in all of these countries and us the developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace and actually their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we but we have given to the developing countries the and the ways of thinking that are creating the we have to have a unified view of how to go the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions all has a single very simple solution people say what 's the solution we need was invented by bismarck and some things have changed since the 19th century in the poor world we have to integrate plans to fight poverty in uganda are mooted if we do not solve the climate crisis this is a proposal renewable energy to supply all of the electrical power to europe largely from we need to do it for our own economy the latest figures show that the old model is not working there are a lot of great investments that you can make if you are investing in tar sands then you have a portfolio that is junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent here are just a few of the investments that i personally think advanced efficiency and conservation you 've seen this slide before but there 's a change the only two countries that didn 't ratify and there was a campaign in australia and we trained two hundred and fifty people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in australia but the new prime minister announced that his very first priority would be to change australia 's position on kyoto and he has now they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have this is lake lanier my friend heidi cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names we 'd call the one in the southeast now katrina and we would say it 's headed toward atlanta we can 't wait for the kind of drought australia had to change our political culture the cities supporting kyoto in the u s are up to seven hundred and eighty and i thought i saw one go by there just to localize this which is good news now to close we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine what we need is another hero generation but also the rest of the world have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice just as jill taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted we now have a culture of distraction but we have a planetary and we have to find a way this was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet another gave women the right to vote we can do this we have the capacity to do i 'm optimistic because i believe we have the capacity at moments of great challenge to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us sometimes i hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis this is so terrible what a burden we have i would like to ask you to reframe that how many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts a challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do i think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future let 's do that thank you very much there is deep pain that basically a design issue on issue on a voting form one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn 't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true that hurts al gore you have no idea ca when you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now i mean excited by their plans on global warming ag the answer to the question is is hard for me because on the one hand i think that we should feel really great about the fact that the the republican nominee certain nominee john mccain and both of the finalists for the democratic nomination all three have a very different and forward leaning position on the climate all three have offered leadership and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration and i think that all all three have also been responsible in putting forward but the the campaign dialogue that as illustrated by the questions that was put together by the league of conservation voters by the way the analysis of all the questions and the way the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the orwellian label clean coal has anybody noticed that every single debate has been sponsored by clean coal now even lower emissions the richness and fullness of fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative when i came back from kyoto in with a feeling of great happiness that we 'd gotten that breakthrough there and then confronted the united states senate only one out of one hundred senators was willing to vote to confirm to ratify that treaty whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization co2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization literally and now we mechanized that process changing that pattern requires a scale a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past so that 's why i began by saying be optimistic in what you do but be an active citizen we have to speak up we have to solve this this democracy this this and we have to change that use the internet go on the internet connect with people become very active as citizens have a this alliance for climate protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign grassroots mobilization television internet ads radio newspaper we need help is there something more than that you would like to be doing ag i have prayed that i would be able to find the answer to that question what buckminster fuller once wrote if the future of all human civilization depended on me what would i do how would i be it does depend on all of us but again not just with the light bulbs we most of us here are americans we have a democracy but we have to actively change what 's needed really is and that 's hard to that 's hard to create but it is coming there 's an old african proverb that some of you know that says if you want to go quickly go alone so we have to have a change in consciousness a new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge ca al gore thank you so much for coming to ted"
