  "transcript": "i thought i would read poems i have that relate to the subject of youth and age i was sort of astonished to find out how many i have actually the first one is dedicated to spencer and his grandmother who was shocked by his work my poem is called dirt half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar all because of a word i said not even said really only repeated but i know now her life was hard she lost three children as babies then her husband died too leaving young sons and no money she 'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet but oh her soap might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet the street she lived on was unpaved dare i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again she lived to a hundred even then all along it was the sadness the squalor but i never until now loved her again when that was published in a magazine i got an irate letter from my uncle you have maligned a great woman it took some this is called the dress it 's a longer poem in those days those days when often the first sound you 'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block always late and going heavily down to the cellar to the furnace to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed my friends ' mothers our neighbors all the women i knew wore often much of the day what were called housedresses shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and when you had to go look for a child hang wash on the line or run down the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed dangling beneath their hair in preparation for some great event a ball one would think that never came to pass bleached and with their plucked eyebrows scarily masklike more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding and boys no conception only later would i see the dresses also as a proclamation that in your dim kitchen your laundry your bleak concrete yard what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation your real sensual nature veiled in those sexless vestments was utterly your dominion unless someone had died and not always then you shook hands or at a ball game thumped your friend 's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection and then even kiss how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then we knew so little in those days as little as now i suppose about healing those hurts their best dresses with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices even in lipstick and mascara their hair aflow could only stand wringing bleeding from brother to brother into the generations cornfields cows even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests simplified savage alone already there was wanting to be simpler wanting when they called you never to go back it actually happened right at the time we met part of the poem takes place in space we shared and time we shared it 's called the neighbor her shadow once fumbling the chain on her door then the door slamming fearfully the time it was chris connor singing lush life who till i left her played the same record and head on my sang sweetly along of regrets and depletions she was too young for as i was too young later to believe in her pain it startled then bored then repelled me my seeing her it wasn 't her hiding her ravaged face in her hands muttering an inappropriate hi sometimes there are frightening goings on in the stairwell a man shouting incoherent come back dear ones my sweet angels come back passersby flowing around her her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream detached it had no need of a voice or could no longer bear one the girl my old love her drunkenly stumbling falling sprawling skirt hiked eyes her dishonor what pathways through pain what junctures of what crossings and counterings too many lives in our lives already too many chances for sorrow too many rising in bloody splendor behold me her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs one agonized step at a time my holding the door faltering at the step to the street droning not looking at me can you help me her wavering step into the world her whispering when the in the doctor 's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts just a little and violently blushes wouldn 't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence because not an hour ago while we were on our walk my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking and that brought back to me the stable i worked on weekends when i was twelve and a splendid piebald stallion who whenever he was mounted would buck just like reminded me the steely glinting hooves the eruptions driven from the creature 's mighty innards nostrils madly flared most of my poems actually are urban poems i happen to be reading a bunch that aren 't thirst here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter day and night on a bench in the station until finally one day she vanished we regarded each other unblinkingly even pugnaciously pugnaciously wrathfully even when her bottle was empty some repressed part of myself would go out of control and i 'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench not excrement merely not merely surface and orifice going unwashed rediffusion of rum there was will in it and intention power and ethical rage and rebellion instead i 'd step into my train how rich i would think is the lexicon of our how enduring our bland fatal assurance that reflection then holocaust holocaust host on host the dance of our glances a young woman a teacher passes and chides her be careful you might smiles back and leans into the open window which wouldn 't even be open if it were winter if it were winter someone would have closed it farther and farther though it takes less time than this really an instant and lets herself fall the girl knows what she 's doing the girl she 's not who and the reason she suddenly knows it 's a self inhabited lived in by her a kind of being in the world spontaneously with grace and the girl remembers in this infinite instant already now so many times divided the sadness she felt once hardly knowing she felt it even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd yet the girl falling isn 't myself or she is myself but a self i took of my own volition unto read just one more i don 't usually say that i like to just end but i 'm afraid that ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me says the advertisement for a soft core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand yet these hardly tangible hardly better than harlots can still stir me maybe a coming of age in the american sensual darkness never seeing an unsmudged nipple an uncensored vagina has a young ultra orthodox rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the shrine of averted their gaze what carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them even that though another confession once in a book an absolute angel with tormented tormenting eyes i kept finding myself at her page that she died in the camps made her i didn 't dare wonder why more present more precious died in the camps that too people or jews anyway kept from their children back then but it was like sex you didn 't have to sex and death how close they can seem my passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds when we make love jumbles of faces voices impressions then i am drowning this everything all unbearable awful to be able to die with no special contrition not having been slaughtered or enslaved and not having to know history 's next mad rage or regression it might be a relief no again no what i mean is the world holds me so tightly the good and the bad my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit venus with her sham siren seductress how much more she reveals in her glare of ink than she knows how she incarnates our desperate human need for regard our passion to live in beauty to be beauty to be cherished by glances if by no more or love"
