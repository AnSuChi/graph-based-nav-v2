  "transcript": "i want to talk about a tale of two cities the united states and the the jobs we have the political systems we choose and of course the great questions of war and peace he 's french his name is napoleon a couple of hundred years ago he made this extraordinary projection china is a sleeping lion and when she awakes the world will shake got a few things wrong he got this one absolutely right because china is today not just woken up china has stood up and china is on the march and the question for us all is where will china go and how do we engage this giant of the 21st century it 's projected that china will become by whichever measure ppp market exchange rates the largest economy in the world over the course of the decade ahead and they 're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world america comes second so if china does become the world 's largest economy think about this it 'll be the first time since this guy was on the throne of england george iii not a good friend of napoleon 's that and if you don 't think that 's going to affect the way in which the world happens in the future then personally i think you 've been smoking something and it doesn 't mean you 're from so in short the question we have tonight is how do we understand this it 'll affect so many things it 's happening in some senses under the radar as we are all preoccupied with what 's going in ukraine what 's going on in the middle east what 's going on with isis what 's going on with isil what 's happening with the future of our economies this is a slow and quiet revolution and with a comes also a mega challenge and the mega challenge is this can these two great countries china and the united states china means the beautiful country think about that that 's the name that china has given this country for more than a hundred years whether these two great civilizations these two great countries can in fact carve out a common future for themselves can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace which is a little less time than they gave this guy to write a book why is it that a kid growing up in rural australia got interested in learning chinese well there are two reasons for that here 's the first of them that 's betsy the cow now betsy the cow working in a farm was here 's the second reason everyone ever do what their mom told them to do i rarely did but what my mom said to me was one day she handed me a newspaper and she said understand this learn this because it 's going to affect your future so being a very good student of history and so they gave me this name k which means to overcome or to conquer and wn and that 's the character for literature or the arts k wn it 's a major lift from being called kevin to be called conqueror of the classics would you prefer to be called conqueror of the classics and so i went off after that and joined the australian foreign service but here is where pride before pride there always comes a fall so there i am in the embassy in and so there was i if you 've been to a chinese meeting it 's a giant horseshoe at the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh bahs and so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase he said china and australia are currently enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness and i will improve it note to file never do that it needed to be a little more elegant a little more classical there was a big pause on the other side of the room you could see the giant and the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe because when i rendered his sentence australia and china are enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness in fact what i said was that australia and china were now experiencing fantastic orgasm that was the last time i was asked to interpret but in that little story there 's a wisdom which is as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of five thousand years of continuing history there 's always something new to learn history is against us when it comes to the u s and china forging a common future together and he made this extraordinary observation about it was the rise of athens and the fear that this inspired in sparta that made war inevitable and hence a whole literature about something called the thucydides trap he 's not american and he 's not greek he 's chinese his name is sun tzu he wrote the art of war and if you see his statement underneath it 's along these lines attack him where he is unprepared appear where not looking good so far for china and the united states this guy is an american his name 's graham allison in fact he 's a teacher at the kennedy school over there in boston it 's a core question and what graham has done is explore fifteen cases in history since the to establish what the precedents are and in eleven out of fifteen of them let me tell you they 've ended in catastrophic war you may say but kevin or conqueror of the classics that was we live now in a world of interdependence and globalization it could never happen again guess what the time which we reached the greatest point of economic integration and globalization was in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen just before so if we are engaged in this great question of how china thinks feels and positions itself towards the united states and the reverse how do we get to the baseline of how these two countries and civilizations can possibly work together china 's views of the u s and the rest of the west number one china feels as if it 's been humiliated at the hands of the west through a hundred years of history beginning with the the western powers carved china up into little pieces so that by the time it got to the ' 20s and ' 30s signs like this one appeared on the streets of shanghai [ no dogs and chinese allowed ] how would you feel if you were chinese in your own country if you saw that sign appear china also believes and feels the peace conference in paris when germany 's colonies were given back to all sorts of countries around in the world what about german colonies in china they were in fact given to japan when japan then invaded china in the the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to china and then on top of that the chinese to this day believe that the united states and the west do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it 's so radically different and believe that the united states to this day is seeking to undermine their political system china also believes that it is being contained by u s allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the u s right around its periphery and beyond all that the chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective west and believe that in fact we in the collective west are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy it 's not just the sound of one hand clapping and that 's called the u s so how does the u s respond to all of the above the u s has a response to each of those on the question of is the u s containing china they say no look at the history of the soviet union that was containment instead what we have done in the welcome them into the world trade organization the united states says that the chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it 's at such fundamental variance to the human rights democracy and rule of law that we enjoy in the u s and the collective west that they fear that china boot the united states out and in time when it 's powerful enough unilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order so apart from all of that it 's just fine and dandy the u s china relationship no real problems there deep rooted feelings those deep rooted emotions and thought patterns what the chinese call swi ways of thinking how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two i argue simply this we can do it on the basis on a framework of constructive realism for a common purpose be realistic about the things that we disagree on and a management approach that doesn 't enable any one of those differences to break into war or conflict until we 've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them be constructive in areas of the bilateral regional and global engagement between the two which will make a difference for all of like you 've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fists apart of course all that happens if you 've got a common mechanism and political will to achieve the above these things are deliverable but the question is are they deliverable alone this is what our head tells us we need to do but what about our heart i have a little experience in the question back home of how you try to bring together two peoples who frankly haven 't had a whole lot in common in the past and that 's when i apologized to australia 's indigenous peoples this was a day of reckoning in the australian government the australian parliament and for the australian people the important thing it was extraordinary to see for example old women it was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace and to kiss aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building and one woman said to me it 's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life and she was over that 's a terrible story and then i remember this family saying to me we drove all the way from the far north down to canberra to come to this thing drove our way through redneck country on the way back stopped at a cafe after the apology for a milkshake and they walked into this cafe quietly i think you know what i 'm talking about but the day after the apology what happened everyone in that cafe every one of the white folks stood up and applauded something had happened in the hearts of these people in australia and we haven 't solved all these problems together but let me tell you there was a new beginning the head says there 's a way but the heart must also find and the possibilities of china 's future engagement in the world in america we 're all familiar with the term the american dream i think it 's time across the world that we 're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind we might just change the way that we think about each other that 's my challenge to america that 's my challenge to china that 's my challenge to all of us but i think where there 's a will and where there is imagination we can turn this into a future driven by peace and prosperity and not once again repeat the tragedies of war i thank you sides kevin rudd well what we australians do best is organize the drinks so but no look for all of us who are friends of these two great countries america and china you can do something and for all you good folks here next time you meet someone from sit down and have a conversation see what you can find out about where they come from and what they think and my challenge for all the chinese folks who are going to watch this ted talk at some time is do the same two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference those of us up the middle we can make a small contribution"
