  "transcript": "and professional football have to do with empathy and what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow now unfortunately i 'm only going to answer one of those questions today so please try and contain your disappointment but augmented reality is not science and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen and people need to be aware of that because augmented reality will change our lives i 'm sure many of you are familiar with google glass what you may not be familiar with is that google glass is a device that will allow you to see what i see it will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you i have to use words i have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination with google glass we can put that underneath a helmet and we can get a sense of what it 's like to be running down the field at one hundred miles an hour your blood pounding in your ears you can get a sense of what it 's like to have a and i 've been on the receiving end of that and it doesn 't feel very good small taste of what it 's like to get tackled on the football field the rest of the team we have some video of that courtesy of the university of washington but this is nowhere what it 's like to be on the nfl fans want that experience fans want to be on that field they want to be their favorite players and they 've already talked to me on youtube they 've talked to me on twitter saying hey can you get this on a quarterback can you get this on a running back we want that experience well once we have that experience with how do we make it more immersive how do we take that next step well we take that step by going to something called the oculus rift which i 'm sure many of you are also familiar with the oculus rift has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created and that is not empty hype i 'm going to show you why that is not empty hype with this video that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in fear of his life what do you think that fan 's experience is going to be when we take what do you think that fan 's experience is going to be when he 's messi sprinting down the pitch putting the ball in the back of the net or federer serving in wimbledon what do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over seventy miles an hour as an olympic downhill skier i think adult diaper sales may surge not yet augmented reality this is only virtual reality v r how do we get to augmented reality a r we get to augmented reality when coaches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see and they say how do we use this to make our teams they like winning it makes them money other teams followed suit more people watched the game because it was more exciting it was faster in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four the nfl put helmet radios into the helmets of the quarterbacks and later the defense more people watched games because it was faster it was more entertaining and coaches really want this because and coaches hate losing games losing games gets you fired as a coach they don 't want that but augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook what would that be like well a very simple setup would be a camera on each corner you take all that information and you stream it to your players the good teams stream it in a way that the players can use the bad ones have information overload that determines good teams from bad and now your i t department is just as important as your scouting department and is not for nerds anymore it 's also for jocks who knew imagine you 're the quarterback you take the snap and you drop back you 're scanning downfield for an open receiver you step up into the pocket another flash alerts you to an open however on the receiver 's visor he sees a patch of grass light up and he knows to readjust tons of people watch because people want this experience fans want to be on the field they want to be their favorite player augmented reality will be a part of sports because it 's too profitable not to but the question i ask you is is that 's all that we 're content to use augmented reality for are we going to use it solely for our panem our circenses our entertainment as normal because i believe that we can use augmented reality for something more i believe we can use augmented reality reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person 's shoes we know what this technology is worth to sports leagues but what is this technology worth to a teacher in a classroom trying to show a bully just how harmful his actions are from the perspective of the victim what is this technology worth to a gay ugandan or russian trying to show the world what it 's like living under persecution what is this technology worth to a commander hadfield or a neil degrasse tyson ladies and gentlemen the choices we make and the challenges we face are as always up to us"
