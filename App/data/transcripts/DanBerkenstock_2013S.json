  "transcript": "i was a ph d student living two lives and in the other i was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies industrial facilities around the world and i was always looking for a better canvas to tie these all together and although i was a i hadn 't thought about using satellite imagery in my work and what i found really surprised me but i was intrigued i mean satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff but there 's still so much we don 't know on a daily basis how much oil is stored in all of china how much corn is being produced how many ships are in all of our world 's ports now in theory all of these questions could be then how come i couldn 't get my hands on more recent pictures so the story begins over fifty years ago with the launch of the first generation of u s government photo reconnaissance satellites there 's a handful of the great great grandchildren of these early cold war machines which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and i and that 's created tremendous pressure to launch things infrequently and to make sure that when you do you cram as much functionality in there as but in order to visualize just how sparsely our planet is collected some friends and i put of the thirty million pictures that have been gathered by these satellites between two thousand and two thousand and ten and even the areas that are seen most frequently those in red are seen at best once a quarter now as aerospace engineering grad students this chart cried out to us as a challenge does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three seven hundred and forty seven jumbo jets wasn 't there a way to build a smaller simpler new satellite design that could enable more timely imaging i realize that it does sound a little bit crazy that we were going to go out and just begin designing satellites but fortunately we had help 1990s a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the price of putting things in space this was hitchhiking small satellites alongside much larger satellites this dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of one hundred and suddenly we could afford to experiment to take a little bit of risk and to realize a lot and a new generation of engineers and scientists mostly out of universities began launching these very small now it was using the lessons learned from these early missions that my friends and i began a series of sketches of our own satellite design and i can 't remember a specific day where we made a conscious decision that we were actually going to go out and build these things but once we got that idea in our minds of the world as a dataset of being able to capture millions of data points on a daily basis describing the global economy of being able to unearth billions of connections between them that had never before been found and began working to take our design from the drawing board into the lab size but as we began to better understand the laws of physics we found that the quality of pictures those satellites could take was very limited and we found that the best picture we would have been able to get looked something like this frankly it was just too blurry to see the things that make satellite imagery valuable and they told us that back in the 1970s the u s government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff that in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution being able to see objects one meter in size they had found that they could not just get very high quality images but get a lot of them at an affordable price from our own computer simulations we quickly found that one meter really was the minimum viable product to be able to see the drivers of our global economy for the first time being able to count the ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks that move around our world on a daily basis while conveniently still not being able to see individuals now more like a mini fridge but we still wouldn 't have to build a pickup truck so now we had our constraint the laws of physics dictated the absolute minimum sized telescope that we could build basically a flying telescope with four walls and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book that used less power than a one hundred watt lightbulb similar to a xerox machine now people use these because they get a lot of light which means less of the noise you see in a low cost cell phone image the problem with them is they require very sophisticated pointing you have to stay focused on a 50 centimeter target from over six hundred miles away while moving at more than seven kilometers a second which requires an awesome degree of complexity originally created for use in night vision goggles but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system and we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well by day our design evolved from cad to prototypes to production units we packed up skysat one put our signatures on it and waved goodbye for the last time on earth it 's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks and soon we 'll turn our attention to launching a constellation of twenty four or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect so why do all of this why build these satellites well it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come and beyond economic data unlocking the human story moment by moment for a data scientist that just happened to go to space camp as a kid it just doesn 't get much better than that"
