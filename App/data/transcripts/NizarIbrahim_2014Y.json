  "transcript": "and there 's very little we know about them these thoughts were going through my head when i looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book i was about five years old at the time paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far flung corners of the world and now a few years later i 've led several expeditions to the ultimate on this planet the sahara i 've worked in the sahara because i 've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre giant predatory dinosaur called spinosaurus a few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of egypt and were described about one hundred years ago by a german bones were destroyed in world war ii so all we 're left with are just a few drawings and notes which lived about one hundred million years ago and it had long slender jaws a bit like a crocodile but that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next one hundred years my fieldwork took me to the border region between morocco and algeria a place called the kem kem it 's a difficult place to work in you have to deal with sandstorms and snakes we found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs medium sized predatory these fossils were deposited in a river system the river system was also home to a giant car sized coelacanth a monster sawfish and the skies over the river system were filled flying reptiles it was a pretty dangerous place not the kind of place where you 'd want to travel to if you had a time machine so we 're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside spinosaurus but spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive we were just finding bits and pieces and i was hoping that we 'd find a partial skeleton at some point finally very recently we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of we returned to the site we collected more bones and so after one hundred years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature and we were able to reconstruct it we now know that spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile we had skull bones feet wide feet again very unusual no other dinosaur has feet like this we also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone the inside structure of spinosaurus bones and it turns out that they 're very dense we realized that yes this was a dinosaur unlike any other it written all over it but really the entire skeleton has water loving written all over it dense bone so as we fleshed out our spinosaurus i 'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin we realize that we 're dealing with a river monster feeding on the many aquatic animals i showed you earlier on and some people told me wow this is a once in a lifetime discovery there are not many things left to discover in the and when people tell me there are no places left to explore i like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter roy chapman andrews and he said there has been an adventure just around the corner thank you"
