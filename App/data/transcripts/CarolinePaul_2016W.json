  "transcript": "and i really wanted to set a world record myself but there was just one small problem i had absolutely no i decided to set a world record in something that demanded absolutely no skill at all i decided to set a world record in crawling laughter now the record at the time was twelve and a half miles and for some reason this seemed totally manageable recruited my friend anne and together we decided we didn 't even need to train and on the day of our record attempt we put furniture pads on the outside of our good luck jeans and we set off and right away we were in trouble and soon our knees were being chewed up then it got dark and to give you an idea of the suffer fest that i was undergoing after so i was short because i didn 't know it then but and i was the 15th woman in a department of one thousand five hundred men so even though i was a five ten 150 pound collegiate rower and someone who could endure twelve hours of searing knee pain i knew i still had to prove my strength and fitness there was black smoke billowing from a building off an alleyway there was an explosion and then i groped for the opened up the water and i tackled the fire myself the explosion had been caused by a water heater so nobody was hurt and ultimately it was not a big deal but later skip came up to me and said nice job caroline in this surprised sort of voice and i was confused because the fire hadn 't been difficult physically so why was he looking at me with something like astonishment who was by the way a really nice guy and an excellent firefighter and he wasn 't the only one all that fire all that danger aren 't you scared and i became curious why wasn 't bravery expected of women now the answer began to come when a friend of mine lamented to me that her young daughter was a big scaredy cat and so i began to but more than that the parents were anxious most of what they said to her when she was outside began with be careful watch out or no now my friends were not bad parents they were just doing what most parents do which is cautioning their daughters much more than they caution their sons there was a study involving a playground fire pole ironically and if the little girls still wanted to play on the fire pole a parent was very likely to assist but the little boys so what message does this send to both boys and girls well that girls are fragile and more in need of help and that boys can and should master difficult tasks by themselves it says that girls should be fearful and boys should be gutsy and yet we adults act as if girls are more fragile and more in need of help and they can 't handle as much and guess what well so now i had my answer this is why women even were expected to be scared this is why women often are scared now i know some of you won 't believe me when i tell you this but i am not against fear so i was a paraglider pilot for many years paraglider is a parachute like wing and it does fly very well but to many people i realize it looks just like a bedsheet with strings attached and i know you 're thinking you 're like caroline a little fear would make sense here i knew the conditions were good but i would take a good hard look at it assess just how relevant it was so i 'm not against fear i 'm just the fear we learn and the experiences we don 't stay with us as we become women and morphs into all those things that we face and try to shed our hesitation in speaking out our deference so that we can be liked so how do we become brave so first we have to take a deep breath and encourage our girls to skateboard climb trees and clamber around on that playground fire pole this is what my own mother did but researchers have a name for this they call it risky play it teaches it teaches confidence they learn valuable life lessons we have to stop cautioning our girls willy nilly so notice next time you say watch out you 're going to get hurt or don 't do that it 's dangerous and remember that often what you 're really telling her is that she shouldn 't be pushing herself third so here 's another thing fear and exhilaration feel very similar the shaky hands so practice and while girls should be getting outside to learn to be gutsy i get that adults don 't want to get on we all should be practicing finally on her bike on the top of the steep hill that she insists she 's too scared to go down ultimately maybe that hill because this is not about the steep hill in front of her this is about the life ahead of her and that she has the tools to handle and assess all the dangers that we cannot protect her from all the challenges that we won 't be there to guide her through so by the way the world record for crawling today and i would really love to see a girl go break that"
