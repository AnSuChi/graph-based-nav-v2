  "transcript": "and i don 't use botox as yet so i 'm clean but i do behave like you saw like and i peddle love to millions of people back home in india who assume that i 'm the best lover in the world if you don 't tell anyone i 'm going to tell you i 'm not but i never let that assumption go away and i feel really sad for you self obsessed as a movie star should be chris and juliet called me here to speak about the future you naturally it follows i 'm going to speak about the present me believe that humanity is a lot like me it is it is it 's an aging movie star wondering whether it got it right in the first place and still trying to find a way i was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of my father was a freedom fighter my mother was well just a fighter like mothers are and much like the original homo sapiens we struggled to survive when i was in my early 20s i lost both my parents which i must admit seems a bit careless of me now but i do remember the night my father died and i remember the the driver of a neighbor who was driving us and in the middle of her quiet crying my mother looked at me and she said son when did you learn to drive mom so from that night onwards much akin to humanity in its adolescence i learned the crude tools of survival and the framework of life was very you just ate what you got and did whatever you were told to do i thought and vegan of course was mr spock 's lost comrade in star trek you married the first girl that you dated and you were a techie and lesbian of course was the capital of portugal as you all know where was i we relied on systems and we felt that governments actually worked for our betterment science was simple and apple was still then just a fruit owned by eve first and then newton not by steve jobs until then what you screamed when you wanted to migration most importantly you were who you were and you said what you thought and my framework like the newly industrialized aspirational humanity began to alter things started to look a little different i met people who had descended from all over the world became more and more fluid work began to define you at that time in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner and all the systems started to feel less reliable to me almost too thick to hold on to the diversity of mankind and the human need to progress and grow ideas were flowing with more freedom and i experienced when supported i was all over the place you know i 'd done fifty films by then and two hundred songs and i 'd been knighted by the malaysians i had been given the highest civil honor the title of which for the life of me i can 't pronounce even until now laughter i 'm sorry france and thank you france for doing that but much bigger than that i got to meet angelina jolie for two and a half seconds and i 'm sure she also remembers that encounter somewhere and i sat next to hannah montana on a round dinner table with her back towards me most of the time like i said i was flying from miley to jolie the internet happened i was in my late 40s and i started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage and assuming that you know people who peered into my world would admire it but something else awaited me and humanity you know we had expected an expansion of ideas and dreams we had not bargained for the thought of judgment of definition that flowed from the same place that freedom and revolution was taking place in everything i said took a new meaning everything i did good bad ugly was there for the world to comment upon and judge as a matter of fact everything i didn 't say or do also met with the same fate four years ago it was claimed on the net that he was the love child apparently he had sown his wild oats with a girl while driving her car in romania and yeah there was a fake video to go with it and we were so disturbed as a family my son who is nineteen now even now when you say hello to him he just turns around and says but bro i didn 't even have a european driving license and i started to feel and humanity at this time i started to sell everything from hair oil you know i even tried to get into a skintight superhero suit and just an aside i want to say on behalf of all the you have to commend commend them because it really hurts in the crotch that superhero suit yeah i 'm being honest i need to tell you this here i happened to even invent a new dance form so if it 's all right i 'll just show you i 'm talented otherwise so it went something like this lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance lungi dance and whole humanity seemed as confused and lost as i was i even tried to reconstruct my identity on the social media like everyone i thought if i put on philosophical tweets out there people will think i 'm with it but some of the responses i got from those tweets were extremely confusing acronyms which i didn 't understand thought provoking tweets and i asked my 16 year old daughter and she enlightened me thanking but here we are i am fifty one years old like i told you because the present you is brave the present you and in this feeling a little brave just before i came here and i realized that i 'm beginning to look more and more like the wax statue of me at madame tussaud 's yeah and in that moment of realization i asked the most central and pertinent question to humanity and me i 'm an actor like i told you a modern expression the land i come from is the source of inexplicable but very simple spirituality in its immense generosity india decided somehow that i the muslim son of a broke freedom fighter who accidentally ventured into the should become its king of romance the badhshah of bollywood the greatest lover the country has ever seen with this face yeah laughter which has alternately been described as ugly the people of this ancient land embraced me in their limitless love and i 've learned from these people that neither power nor poverty i 've learned from the people of my country that the dignity of a life a human being a culture a religion a country actually resides in its ability for grace and compassion i 've learned whatever urges you to create to build whatever keeps you from failing whatever helps you survive is perhaps the oldest and the simplest emotion known and that is love a mystic poet from my land famously wrote actually saying that all the books of knowledge that you might read and then but mankind will never be the wiser about its future unless it is coupled with a sense of love and compassion for their fellow beings the two and a half alphabets which form the word so i truly believe the future you has to be a you that loves otherwise it will cease to flourish it will perish in its own self absorption so you may use your power to build walls or you may use it to break barriers and welcome them in you may use your faith to make people afraid or you can use it to give courage to people so they rise to the greatest heights of enlightenment you can use your energy to build nuclear bombs and spread the darkness of destruction or you can use it to spread the joy of light to millions you may filthy up the oceans callously and cut down all the forests you can destroy the ecology or turn to them with love and regenerate life from the waters and trees you may land on mars and build armed or you may look for life forms and species to learn from and respect and you can use all the moneys we all have earned to wage futile wars or you can use it to make more food to fill their stomachs my country has taught me the capacity for a human being to love is akin to godliness it shines forth i think already has tampered too much with talking about individual achievements the innovation the technology the sciences the knowledge we are gaining being here in the presence of ted talks and all of you are reasons enough for us to celebrate the future us but within that celebration the quest to cultivate our capacity for love and compassion so i believe the future you is an infinite you it ends where it begins from to complete itself a you that perceives time and space differently understands both your your unimaginable in the larger context of the universe a you that returns back to the original innocence of humanity which loves from the purity of heart which sees from the eyes of like an aging movie star wholly it has to be a you to create a world which is its"
