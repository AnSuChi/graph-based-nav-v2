  "transcript": "it 's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice i 'm extremely grateful i have been blown away and i want to thank all of you for the the many partly because i need that put yourselves in my position i flew on air force two for eight years now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane i 'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that 's been like for me soon after tipper and i left the white house driving ourselves i know it sounds like a little thing to you but i looked in the rear view mirror and there was no motorcade back there you 've heard of phantom limb pain this was a rented ford taurus and we started looking for a place to eat we were on i 40 we got to exit two hundred and thirty eight lebanon tennessee we got off the exit we found a shoney 's restaurant low cost family restaurant chain for those of you who don 't know it we sat down at the booth and the waitress came over made a big commotion over tipper she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying and she said yes that 's former vice president al gore and his wife tipper 's been kind of a series of epiphanies the very next day continuing the totally true story i got on a to fly to africa to make a speech in nigeria in the city of lagos on the topic of and i told it pretty much the same way i 've just shared it with you tipper and i were driving ourselves shoney 's low cost family restaurant chain what the man said they laughed i fell asleep on the plane until during the middle of the night call washington and i thought to myself in the middle of the night in the middle of the atlantic what in the world could be wrong in washington then i remembered it could be a bunch of things laughter but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services and it had already been printed in cities all across the united states of america it was printed in monterey i checked laughter and the story began former vice president al gore announced in nigeria yesterday quote ' my wife tipper and i have opened a low cost family restaurant leno had already started in on one of them had me in a big white chef 's hat i got a nice long handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague bill clinton saying congratulations on the new restaurant we like to celebrate each other 's successes in life i was since i plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to ted that maybe i could talk about that i want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you do i want to start with a couple of and i 'm going to i update the slide show every time i give it i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it it we got the new temperature records in this is just for the united states of america historical average for now i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these under business as usual efficiency in in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit efficiency and conservation it 's not a cost it 's a profit the sign is wrong it 's not negative it 's positive these are investments that pay for themselves but they are also very effective in deflecting our path but i want you to put it in perspective it 's an easy visible target of concern and it should be but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest standards in the world and so we should address that but it 's part of the puzzle renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference and with what vinod and john doerr and others many of you here there are a lot of people directly involved in this this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it carbon capture and sequestration that 's what ccs stands for is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe what can you do reduce emissions in your home most of these expenditures are also profitable insulation better design buy green electricity where where you can i mentioned automobiles buy a hybrid figure out some of the other options that are much better it 's important be a green consumer you have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the on the global consider this make a decision to live a i 'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people it is easier than you think it really is a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy it means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced and what what it means is elaborated participant productions convened with my active involvement the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a you will be given options to reduce and click through purchases of offsets next consider making your business integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations whether you majora mentioned this listen if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance don 't ever again complain about quarterly report ceo management time people do what you pay them to do and if they judge how much they 're going to get paid on your your capital that they 've invested based on the short term returns you 're going to get short term decisions a learn about it talk about it consider sending somebody to and i am personally going to train people to give this slideshow re purposed with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and it and so i 'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse limited use copyrights so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way it doesn 't mean that if you 're a republican that i 'm trying to convince you to be a democrat and i know that in this group it really is become politically active make our democracy work the way it 's supposed to work support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions global warming pollution and trading it here 's why serve on the board of directors of a corporation you will have legal liability if you do not urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided the market will work to solve this problem if if we can accomplish this we have to change the minds of the american people because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to to be done it 's now repetition of short i need your help on this somebody said the test we 're facing now a scientist told me is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination laughter that 's really true again the republicans here this shouldn 't be partisan you have more influence than some of us who are democrats do this is an opportunity not just this but connected to the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them we are one thank you very much
