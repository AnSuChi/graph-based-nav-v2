  "transcript": "igniting the thirty years that 's long enough for a generation of managers to retire but they didn 't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity 's flexibility and then productivity soared often doubling or even tripling in those factories electricity is an example of a general purpose technology like the steam engine before it factory redesign is there a general purpose technology of our era and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories we 're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system we 're not doing as well at that job as we should be as we 'll see in a moment productivity is and the income of the typical worker is stagnating these troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed as the end of innovation but they are actually the growing pains of what andrew mcafee and i call the new machine age so here 's gdp per person in america but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it and here 's productivity you can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid after a lag productivity accelerated again but sometimes it rhymes 2000s than it did in the the global news because the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production it 's mind not matter brain not brawn ideas not things that creates a problem for standard metrics because we 're getting more and more stuff for free sure of that 's not how economists measure gdp zero price means zero weight in the gdp statistics but i 'm listening to more and better music than ever you know i bet you are too in total my research estimates that the gdp numbers miss over three hundred billion dollars per year in free goods and services on the internet but we need to make predictions about the underlying drivers of exponential when goods are digital they can be replicated with perfect quality and they can be delivered but there 's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world measurement is the lifeblood of science secondly the new machine age is exponential computers get better faster than anything else ever a child 's playstation but our brains are wired for a linear world as a result exponential trends take us by surprise i used to teach my students that there are some things you know computers just aren 't good at like driving a car through traffic here 's andy and me grinning like madmen because we just rode down route one hundred and one in yes a driverless car but the reality here 's an example in just a matter of a few weeks an undergraduate student of mine built an app that ultimately reached one point three million users users and that was built on top of the internet and so on and so forth and we 're seeing a wave of astonishing like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound you know robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation laughter but perhaps the most important invention the most important invention is consider one project ibm 's watson these little dots here those are all the champions on the quiz show but it improved at a rate faster than any human could and shortly after dave ferrucci showed this chart to my class at mit watson beat the world jeopardy champion watson is still kind of in its its teachers let it surf the internet damn isn 't it ironic that at the very moment we are building intelligent so does that mean we have nothing to worry about no technology is this is the great decoupling of productivity from employment of not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling but like too many others they misunderstand its basic causes but it 's leaving more and more people we can take a routine job codify it in a set of machine readable instructions and then replicate it a million times you know i recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics this guy says cheaper and more accurate how can a skilled worker compete with a $ thirty nine piece of software she can 't but seventeen percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs that is a microcosm of what 's happening not just in software and services but in media and music in finance and manufacturing in retailing and trade in short in every industry people are racing against the the answer is not to try to slow down technology instead of racing against the machine we need to learn to race with the machine that is our grand challenge the new machine age can be dated to a day fifteen years played deep blue a supercomputer it got so bad that when he was asked what strategy he would use against a neither is a human because kasparov organized a freestyle tournament and it had no supercomputer what they had and they showed that a team of humans and computers working together could beat any computer or any human working alone racing with the machine we shape our destiny"
