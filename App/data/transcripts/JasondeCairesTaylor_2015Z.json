  "transcript": "i had no idea if it would work i made my first and then this incredible thing happened it transformed one sculpture became two two quickly became twenty six and before i knew it we had the world 's first underwater sculpture park in two thousand and nine i moved to mexico and started by casting local fisherman this grew to a small community and then finally to an underwater museum with over five hundred it seems is not just for greenhouses we 've since scaled up the designs ocean atlas in the bahamas rising sixteen feet up to the surface and weighing over forty tons the first of its kind in the we use materials and designs that help encourage life a cement the formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish on a really large scale even this vw beetle has an internal living habitat to encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins because honestly it 's really not easy when you 're in the middle of the sea under trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor you start to wonder whether i shouldn 't have taken up watercolor painting instead but in the end the results always blow my mind incredible exhibition space an artist could ever wish for explosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery a unique timeless quality and the procession of each lending their own special touch to the site i 've realized that the greatest thing about what we do because as soon as we sink them the sculptures they belong to the sea as new reefs form a new world literally starts to evolve a world that continuously amazes me it 's a bit of a staghorn coral morphs the form fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed tunicates explode from the faces sea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night the deepest red i 've ever seen in my life lives underwater and grey angelfish glide silently overhead because it seems that these images translate across the world and this couldn 't be a better place to talk about the really really important effect of my work because as we all know our reefs are dying and our oceans are in trouble so here 's the thing the most used searched and shared image of all my work thus far is this and i think this is at least i hope it is what i really hope is that people are beginning to understand that when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature that we need to start thinking about our oceans too since building these sites we 've seen some phenomenal and unexpected results besides creating over eight hundred square meters of new habitats and living reef visitors to the marine park in cancun now divide half their time between the museum and the natural reefs providing significant rest for natural overstressed areas the subsequent international media forced the local government to pledge ten million dollars in coastal cleanups the sculpture park in grenada was instrumental in the government designating a spot a entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers to manage tourism and fishing quotas the site was actually listed as a wonder of the world by national geographic so why are we all here today in this room what do we all have in common i think we all share a fear that we don 't protect our oceans enough and one way of thinking about this is that we don 't regard our oceans as and we should when we see incredible places like the himalayas or the la sagrada famlia or the mona lisa even and we do our best to cherish them to protect them and to keep them safe but in order to do that we are the ones that have to museums are places of preservation of places where we keep objects of great value to us where we simply treasure them for them being themselves if someone was to throw an egg at the sistine chapel we 'd all go crazy yet every day we dredge pollute and overfish our because for most people the ocean is like this and it 's really hard to think of something that 's just so plain and so enormous as fragile it 's simply too massive too vast too endless and what do you see here i think most people actually look past to the horizon so i think there 's a real danger that we never really see the sea and if we don 't really see it if it doesn 't have its own iconography if we miss its majesty then there 's a big danger that we take it for granted but because of our work there there 's now a little corner of cancun i installed these four horsemen of the apocalypse in the thames river in central london right in front of the houses of parliament putting a stark message about climate change in front of the people that have the power to help change because for me this is just the beginning of the mission we want to team up with and we want to see beyond art even and instead of getting taken to the natural history museum or an aquarium you get taken out to the ocean clearly it would blow your mind so let 's think big and let 's think deep who knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us i hope that by bringing our art into the ocean that not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity and visual impact of the setting but that we are also giving something back and by encouraging new environments to thrive and in some way opening up a new or maybe it 's a really old way of seeing the seas as delicate precious places worthy of our protection our oceans are sacred"
