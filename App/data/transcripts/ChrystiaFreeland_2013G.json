  "transcript": "here 's the most important economic fact of our time particularly between those at the very top and everyone else this shift is the most striking in the in the u k but it 's a global phenomenon it 's happening in communist china in formerly communist russia it 's happening in india let me give you a few numbers to place what 's happening the one percent accounted for about ten percent of the national income in the united states today their share has more than doubled to above twenty percent but what 's even more striking is what 's happening at the very tippy top of the income distribution the zero point one percent in the account for more than eight percent of the national income they are where the one percent was thirty years ago the secretary of labor in the clinton administration reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich bill gates and warren buffett and he has his own favorite the combined wealth of the people on the forbes four hundred list and this is the list of the four hundred richest americans was three hundred billion dollars just think about it you didn 't even need to be a billionaire to get on that list in one thousand nine today that figure has more than quintupled to one point seven trillion and i probably don 't need to tell you that we haven 't seen anything similar happen to the middle class whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased but we 've been slow to notice it changes which are slow and gradual can be hard to notice talking about income inequality even if you 're not on the forbes four hundred list can make us feel uncomfortable and if you do talking about income distribution especially at the top and what can we do about it one set of causes is political privatization weaker legal protections for trade unions all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very very top a lot of these political factors can be broadly but don 't actually do much good for the rest of us in practice getting rid of crony capitalism is incredibly difficult think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in russia for instance or how hard it is the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the great depression or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies it 's an easy problem indeed this is one of those rare issues that unites the left and the right a critique of crony capitalism is as central to the tea party as it is to occupy wall street but if crony capitalism is things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality in these aren 't too mysterious globalization and the technology revolution the twin economic transformations which are changing our lives and transforming the global economy are also powering the rise just think about it for the first time in history if you are an energetic entrepreneur with a brilliant new idea or a fantastic new product you have almost instant almost frictionless access to a global market of more than a billion people the latest poster boy for this phenomenon is david karp the think about that for a minute it 's easiest to see how the technology revolution and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect in highly visible fields like sports and entertainment we can all watch how a fantastic athlete or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills across the global economy as never before we have superstar technologists we have superstar lawyers and superstar architects there are superstar cooks and superstar farmers there are even and this is my personal favorite example superstar dentists the frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like russian oligarch roman abramovich but while it 's pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution and that 's because in contrast with crony capitalism so much of what globalization and the technology revolution have done is highly positive i love the fact that they mean that whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk far beyond this auditorium i 'm even more of a fan of globalization this is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world 's poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class if you happen to live in the rich part of the world it 's made many new products affordable who do you think built your iphone and things that we 've relied on for a long time much cheaper think of your dishwasher or your t shirt so what 's not to like well a few things one of the things that worries me is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy can become crony plutocracy it gets tempting at that point to use your economic nous to manipulate the rules of the global political economy in your own favor and that 's no mere hypothetical example google starbucks these are among the world 's most admired most beloved most innovative companies they also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill and why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage once you have the tremendous economic power that we 're seeing at the very very top of the income distribution it becomes tempting as well to start trying to change the rules of the game in your own favor this is no mere hypothetical it 's what the russian oligarchs did in creating the sale of the century privatization of russia 's natural resources it 's one way of describing what happened with deregulation of the financial services in the u s and the u k a second thing that worries me is how easily meritocratic plutocracy one way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today 's economy that 's why they are spending unprecedented time and resources educating their own children the middle class is spending more on schooling the ninety nine percent is increasingly outgunned by the one percent the result is something that economists alan krueger and miles corak call the great gatsby curve as income inequality increases social mobility decreases but increasingly you have to be born on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race the third thing and this is what worries me the most is the extent to which those same largely positive forces which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy let 's start with technology and in contrast with the industrial revolution the titans of our new economy aren 't creating that many new jobs facebook fewer than ten thousand the same is true of globalization for all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets it the terrifying reality is that there is no economic rule which automatically translates increased economic growth into widely shared prosperity that 's shown in what i consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time since the late increases in productivity have been decoupled from increases in wages and employment that means that our countries are getting richer our companies are getting more efficient but we 're not creating more jobs and we 're not paying people as a whole more one scary conclusion you could draw from all of this is to worry about structural unemployment after all in a totally free labor market we could find jobs for pretty much everyone the dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent google and its ilk after all all of us here are richer there are a few exceptions and live longer but it 's important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the industrial revolution with the broad swathes of society we had to go through two world wars we also not coincidentally we created public health today we are living through an era of economic transformation comparable in its scale and its scope to the industrial revolution to be sure that this new economy benefits us all and not just the plutocrats we need to embark on an era of comparably ambitious social and political change we need a new new deal"
