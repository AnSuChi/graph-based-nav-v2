  "transcript": "what an intriguing group of individuals you are to a psychologist i 've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other and i think it 's fair to say already that there are people displaying psychological symptoms i would like to discuss today laughter and i thought you might like to know who you are but instead of pointing at you which would be gratuitous and intrusive i 'm in the field of research known and what we try to do in our own way is to make sense of how each of us each of you is in certain respects like all other people like some other people and like no other person now already you may be saying of yourself i 'm not intriguing even if i am regarded by most people as a great why this is so one of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed and that describe universally held aspects of difference between in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life in contrast to those who are more stable openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and occasionally odd the conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines to persevering as well as having some passion extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people i i tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow did you know that but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion because it 's consequential and it 's intriguing and it helps us understand what i call our three natures first our biogenic nature our neurophysiology or second nature which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives and third what makes you individually you idiosyncratic what i call your idiogenic nature let me explain one of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation parties and social events here at ted you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core they all gather together and i 've seen you the introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor where they are able to but you 're not it may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation sometimes it 's an caffeine for example works much better with extroverts than it does introverts when extroverts come into the office at nine o 'clock in the morning and say i really need a cup of coffee they 're not kidding they really do introverts do not do as well particularly if the tasks they 're engaged in and they 've had some coffee if those tasks are speeded and if they 're quantitative introverts may give the appearance of and that takes me to my next point although i may not have time and so if you would like me to yes you would ok there are studies done on the frequency with which as broken down by male female introvert extrovert so i ask you how many times per minute oh i 'm sorry that was a rat study how many times per month yes more five point five almost twice as much which i will explain they not only handle all the male extroverts they pick up a few introverts as well extroverts and introverts extroverts they like to have a lot of eye contact or mutual gaze so when an extrovert meets a charles it rapidly becomes he 's given a pass to be more intimate extroverts prefer concrete simple language introverts prefer and i must again tell you that i am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine we speak differently we prefer contextually complex contingent first his name is tom mine isn 't secondly he 's six foot five i have a tendency not to be and thirdly he 's as extroverted a person as you could find i am seriously i overload so much i can 't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening we had seconded to this project a fellow called michael so the person who seconded him asked tom and me what do you make of michael well i 'll tell you what tom said in a minute he spoke in classic and here is how extroverted ears heard what i said which is actually pretty accurate i said well michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for he 's an asshole now as an introvert i might gently allude to to certain assholic in this man 's behavior but i 'm not going to lunge for the a word but now is this something that we should be heedful of of course it 's important that we know this is that all we are are we just a bunch of traits remember you 're like some other people and like no other person how about that idiosyncratic you as elizabeth or as george you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism but are there some distinctively elizabethan features of your behavior or georgian of yours that make us love you so what is it that makes us different it 's the doings that we have in our life the personal projects you have a personal project right now but nobody may know it here it relates to your kid you 've been back three times to the hospital and they still don 't know what 's wrong or it could be your mom and you 'd been acting out of character these are free traits you but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital to get something for your mom they 're where we enact a script and they are what matters don 't ask people what type you are ask them but i have a core project which is and i adore my field and i can 't wait to tell them about what 's new what 's exciting what i can 't wait to tell them about and so i act in an extroverted way because at eight in the morning the students need a little bit of humor a little bit of engagement but we need to be very careful when we act out of character sometimes we may find that we don 't take care of ourselves example after a period of i need to repair somewhere on my own as susan cain said in her quiet book in a chapter that featured the strange canadian professor who was teaching at the time at harvard i sometimes go to the men 's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts trying to avoid and a real extrovert came in beside me not right in my cubicle but in the next cubicle over and i could hear various evacuatory noises which we hate even our own if anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months it 's talking on the john thank you"
