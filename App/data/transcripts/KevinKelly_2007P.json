  "transcript": "we know it the kind of web the things we 're all talking about so all of the things that we 've seen come about satellite images of the whole earth which we couldn 't even imagine happening before all these things rolling into our lives just this abundance of things sitting in front of our laptop or our desktop this kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and it 's really amazing that all this stuff is here there 's simply and if i told you it was all coming for free you would say this is and yet it 's here the other thing that we know about it was that ten years ago as i looked at what even wired was talking about that was the model that was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming and it turns out that that 's not what it because we 're unprepared for it and it suggests that that what we want to think about is this thing that we 're making this thing that has happened in five thousand days that 's all these computers all these laptops all these servers basically and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines but that and so i began to think about that and it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we 've ever made it has not crashed and there 's almost no other machine that we 've ever made five thousand days without interruption that 's just unbelievable and of course the web is only five thousand days so i was trying to basically make and i started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe and there 's fifty five trillion links and so i began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions and i made a quick list was it chris jordan the photographer talking about numbers being so large that they 're hard to tell but there 's one billion pc chips on the internet if you count all the chips in all the computers on the internet there 's two million emails per second so it 's a very big number it 's just a huge machine and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet so here 's the specifications just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it one hundred and seventy quadrillion transistors fifty five trillion links emails running at two megahertz itself memory nine exabyte ram and it 's a big machine i figured out one hundred billion clicks per day fifty five trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain a quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain so to a first approximation we have these things twenty petahertz synapse firings of course the memory is is really the size of this machine is the size so if we say this machine right now that we 've made is about one hb one human brain if we look at the rate that this is increasing thirty years from now there 'll be six billion hbs so by the year two thousand and forty the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity in raw bits and stuff and this is i think where ray kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we 're going to cross three consequences of this first that basically what this machine is doing is embodying we and the second thing is we 're going to restructure its we 're going to become completely codependent upon it so let me go through those three things first of all we have all these things in our hands but in fact every screen in the world is looking into the one machine these are all basically portals into that one machine the second thing is that that some people call this the cloud you 're touching the cloud and you 're going to compute that way so the machine is computing and in some ways it 's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing and the microphones and the and everything will go through the web and we 're seeing that already with say phones right now phones don 't go through the web but they are beginning to and they will and if you imagine what say just as an example what google labs has in terms of all these things right now it 's not if you do spreadsheets and things at work a word document they aren 't on the web but they are going to be they 're going to be part of this machine they 're going to speak the web language they 're going to talk to the machine the web in some sense is kind of like a black hole that 's sucking up everything into it and it will be part of this machine so that our environment kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense our environment becomes the so you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels and a because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it and not the materials but in fact and the digital nature of things into the material world that 's what we 're looking forward to that is where we 're going convergence of and so one of the consequences of that i believe is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now tv film video that basically becomes one media platform and while there 's many differences in some senses they will share more and more in common with each other so that the the laws of media such as the fact that copies have no value the value 's in the uncopiable things the immediacy the authentication the personalization the media wants to be liquid so that you can manipulate them not so that they are free as in beer but free as in freedom and the network effects rule meaning that the more you have the more you get the first fax machine the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot there was nobody to fax to and the other thing about about this embodiment is that there 's kind of what i call the mcluhan reversal mcluhan was saying machines are the extensions of the human senses and i 'm saying humans are now going to be the extended that in things like flickr or photosynth program from microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it in a certain sense the machine is seeing now the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of restructuring and i have to warn you that what we 'll talk about is i 'm going to give my explanation of a term you 're hearing which is a semantic web so first of all the first stage that we 've seen and we saw that where you have all the computers of the world and so you were forwarding on you didn 't have control it wasn 't like a telephone system where you had control of a line you had to share packets the second stage that we 're in now is the idea of linking pages so in the old one if i wanted to go on to an airline web page i went from my computer to an ftp site to another airline computer now we have pages the unit has been resolved into pages so one page links to another page and so that 's what we were doing but we 're linking data so we 're going from so the difference is is that or every noun is being supported by the entire web it 's being resolved or words if you want so besides physically coming out again into this idea that it 's not just virtual it 's actually going out to things so something will will resolve so now in this new one when i and so giving an example of this rather than right now pacifica is just sort of a name on the web somewhere the web doesn 't know that that is actually a town and that it 's a specific town that i live in but that 's what we 're going to be talking about it 's going to link directly to it will know the web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place and that whenever it sees that word pacifica it knows that it actually has a place latitude longitude a certain population here are some of the technical terms all three letter things that you 'll see a lot more of all these things are about enabling this this idea of linking to the data each time you go into there you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are why should you be doing that you should just do that once and it should know who all your friends are so that 's what you want is all your friends are identified and you should just carry relationships around all this data about you should just be conveyed and you should do it once and that 's all that should happen and you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data that 's what we 're moving into where it sort of knows these things down to that level a semantic web web three point zero giant global graph we 're kind of trying out what we want to and all these things that are going to be on this are not just they are things everything we 've described every artifact or place will be a specific representation will have a and as the internet of things and so we are in the middle of this thing that 's completely linked down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has so the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we 're going to be codependent and the closer it is the better if you allow google to it will tell you your search history and i found out by looking at it so i am open and being transparent to that and i think total personalization in this new world will require total that is going to be the price if you want to have total personalization you have to be totally transparent google i can 't remember my phone number i 'll just ask google we 're so dependent on this that i have now gotten to the point where i don 't even try to remember things i 'll just google it it 's easier to do that and we kind of object at first saying oh we 're totally dependent and what is happening with this is some kind of ai but it 's not the ai in conscious ai as being an expert larry page told me that that 's what they 're trying to do and that 's what they 're trying to do but when six billion humans are googling who 's searching who so the next five thousand days it 's not going to be the web and only better just like it wasn 't tv and only better the next five thousand days it 's not just going to be the web but only better it 's going to be something different and i think 's going to be smarter it 'll have an intelligence in there that 's not again conscious but it 'll anticipate what we 're doing it 's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment and we will be in the middle of it and all these devices will be portals into that so the single idea that i wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just the web only better but a new kind of stage in this development it looks more global if you take this whole thing more reliable than its parts we can also think about it so we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system more as if this wasn 't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with than the one we 'll have a better word for it but and again i don 't want to talk about consciousness i want to talk about it just as if it or a volvox which is what that organism is"
