  "transcript": "so let 's do that you can see and they look pretty conventional because they 've got plastic they 've got metal they 've got motors and gears and so on they look like they 're straight out of terminator in fact they may well be straight out of you can do lots of really cool things with these robots you can do really exciting stuff but i 'd like to look at different kinds of robots i want to make different kinds of robots but look like these they do all sorts of great things like moving around on the floor they go into our gardens and they eat our crops now wouldn 't it be great if you could use some of those characteristics in future robots so that you could solve some really interesting problems i 'm going to look at a couple of problems now in the environment where we can use the skills and the technologies derived from these animals let 's have a look at two environmental problems they such is the pressure of population around they put on fertilizers nitrates and then when it rains then they go into streams into lakes into rivers and into the sea into those kinds of environments there are organisms in those environments that will be affected by that algae for example algae loves nitrates it loves fertilizer so it will take in all so what do we do now oil comes out of the engines that we use the boats that we use sometimes tankers flush their oil tanks into the sea so oil is released into the sea that way wouldn 't it be nice if we could treat that in some way using robots that could eat the pollution the oil fields have so that 's what we do we make robots that will eat pollution to actually make the robot we take inspiration from two organisms on the right there you see the basking shark the basking shark is a massive shark it collecting plankton and then it uses that energy in its body to keep moving let 's see if we can do that but also we take the inspiration from other organisms i 've got a picture here of a water boatman and the water boatman is really cute when it 's swimming in the water it uses its so we take those two organisms and we combine them together to make a new kind of robot we call it the so a row bot is a robot that rows ok so what does it look like here 's some pictures of the so i 've got the row bot here i row bot what it 's got a body and it 's got a stomach so let 's go through them one at a time why does it have two mouths so you can see really it 's got a mouth and a derriere the second component might be the stomach we need to get the energy into the robot and we need to treat the pollution so the pollution goes in and it will do something so instead of having batteries instead of having it 's a little bit like and they can combine them together and you get electricity technology it was in the apollo space missions that 's from forty fifty years ago if you take some organic material could be some the microbes will eat that food and they will turn it into electricity if you use other kinds of they will eat petroleum so the robot will move through the environment taking food into its stomach so let 's see what happens when we run the row bot when it does some rowing here we 've got a couple of videos the first thing once it 's moved enough it stops and then it closes the mouth slowly closes the mouths and then it will sit there and it will digest the food of course these microbial fuel cells they contain microbes what you really want is lots of energy coming out of those microbes as quickly as possible but we can 't force the microbes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second they generate so that 's a thousand or a million times as much energy that that uses compared to the microbial fuel cell it could take some days a typical cycle for the fill our stomachs when we 've had enough we do the same thing again we could send a message and it contains wires it contains components which themselves are not biodegradable current row bots contain things like toxic batteries you can 't leave those in the environment and then when they 've finished their job of work you need to collect them that limits the number of row bots you can use which when you throw them out there they biodegrade collect them you could put a thousand a million a billion robots into the environment just spread them around so that changes the way in which you think about robots and the way you then the question is can you do this well yes we have shown that you can do this you can make robots which are biodegradable what 's really interesting is you can use household materials to make these biodegradable robots i 'll show you some you might be surprised you can make things called artificial muscles artificial muscles are smart so instead of having a motor you have these artificial muscles and you can make artificial muscles out of jelly if you take some jelly and some salts and you throw them out there and they degrade to nothing if you can use jelly to make a robot now we eat jelly right so why not make something like this maybe do an injection something like that so this changes the way again in which we think about robots and then we 're looking at robots which we can eat thank you very much for your attention"
