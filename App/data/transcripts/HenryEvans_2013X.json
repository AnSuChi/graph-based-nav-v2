  "transcript": "all the way from los altos hills california mr henry evans i grew up in a typical american town near st louis my dad was a i went to notre dame university later jane i worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder eventually becoming a chief financial officer in silicon valley a job i really enjoyed my family and i bought our first and only home on december thirteen two thousand and one fixer upper in a beautiful spot of los altos hills california from where i am speaking to you now we were looking forward to rebuilding it but eight months after we moved in i suffered a stroke like attack caused by a birth defect overnight mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of forty i became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled head tracking devices sold commercially by the company i can surf the web exchange email with people and routinely destroy my friend steve cousins in online word games mentally active and feel like i am a part of the world one day i was lying in bed watching cnn when i was amazed by professor charlie kemp of the healthcare robotics lab at georgia tech demonstrating a pr2 robot i emailed charlie and steve cousins of willow garage and we formed the robots for humanity project robots for humanity developed ways for me to use the i shaved charlie in atlanta i opened my refrigerator on my own i saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live for for example if either of us wants to go sixty miles an hour both of us will need an assistive device called a car your disability doesn 't make you any less of a person and neither does mine check out my sweet ride since birth we have both suffered from the inability to fly on showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones giving a sense of movement and using a mouse cursor i control with my head these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser i became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing i inspected the solar panels on our roof i went even further by seeing if i could use oculus rift as modified by fighting walrus to have an immersive experience controlling the drone with chad 's group at brown i regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week from my home three thousand miles away all work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer i never thought i would be able to casually move around a campus like brown on my own i just wish i could afford the tuition chad jenkins all joking aside i bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in california three thousand miles away okay henry have you been to big finish can you show us how good of a pilot you are little ways to go with that but i think it shows the promise what makes henry 's story amazing is it 's about understanding henry 's needs understanding what what people in henry 's situation need from technology and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way what we 're trying to do is democratize robotics so that anybody can be a part of this we 're providing affordable off the shelf robot platforms such as the a r drone three hundred dollars the suitable technologies beam only seventeen thousand dollars along with open source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we 're trying to do and our hope is is that by providing these tools that you 'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled to provide care for our aging population to help better educate our children back to you henry he thank you chad and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination and perhaps better and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables i would have died it is up to us all of us to decide how robotics will be used for good or for evil for simply replacing people or for making people better for allowing us to do and enjoy more our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone 's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe with the help of people like you we can make this dream a reality"
