  "transcript": "and the the the the the the to do something special today i want to debut a new song that i 've been working on in the last and there 's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience especially when it 's i 'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it because it gets into all sorts of and so this is basically a song about loops but not the kind of loops that i make up here they 're feedback loops and in the audio world that that 's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source and then it gets in this there seems to be it gets ugly so like you can 't feed cows their own brains or you get mad mad cow disease and biological there 's autoimmune diseases where the body attacks itself little too overzealously and destroys and then okay this is where we get to the song kind of bridges the gap to the because although i 've used scientific terms in and there 's some things you just don 't need to have in songs so i 'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody close my eyes sometimes i can 't stop thinking about my own eyes and it 's like your eyes start straining to see themselves that 's what it feels like to me it 's not pleasant i 'm sorry if i put that idea in your head it 's impossible of course for your eyes to see themselves little more closer to a personal experience so i 've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who 's who 's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they 're left to do the deed themselves if that 's possible and that 's what the song is asking all right it doesn 't have a name yet the you can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or but you know i think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now just a little bit i 'm going to finish up with a song of mine called weather systems systems the hurt so"
