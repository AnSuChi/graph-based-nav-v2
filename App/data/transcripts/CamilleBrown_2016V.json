  "transcript": "the bop is a type of social dance dance is a language and social dance is an expression that emerges a community but it 's about the individual and their creative identity because of that social dances bubble up they change and they spread like wildfire they are as old as our remembered history the present always contains the past and the past shapes who we are and who we will be the juba dance was born from enslaved africans ' experience on the plantation this dance was a way for enslaved africans to remember where they 're from it may have looked something like this shuffling feet and patting hands this was how they got around the slave owners ' ban on drumming improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did with drums in haiti or in the yoruba communities of west africa it was about keeping cultural traditions alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity it was the same subversive spirit that created this dance the crazy thing about this dance is that the cakewalk was performed for the masters who never suspected they were being made fun of now you might originally called the funky charleston started by a tight knit black community near charleston south carolina the charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had the freedom to kick their heels and move their legs now social dance is about community and connection it 's no surprise that the twist can be traced back to the brought to america from the congo during slavery but in the late ' 50s right before the civil rights movement the twist is popularized by chubby checker and dick clark through social dance shaping culture and being shaped by it these dances continue to evolve grow and spread"
