  "transcript": "but hardly my first day i graduated from philadelphia public schools and i went on to teach special education for twenty years in a where crime is rampant shortly after i walked into my new school a huge fight broke out among the girls i immediately called a meeting in the school 's auditorium to introduce myself as the school 's new principal the tone for my new students i started listing as forcefully as i could my expectations for their behavior when all of a sudden a girl way in the back of the auditorium this ashley had expressed what i felt and never quite was able to articulate about my own experience when i attended a low performing school in the same neighborhood many many many years earlier that school fast forwarding a decade later to two thousand and twelve i was to be strawberry mansion 's fourth principal in four years it was labeled and persistently dangerous due to its low test scores assaults and found the door locked with chains this is not a school the halls were dim and dark from poor lighting there were tons of piles of broken old furniture and desks in the classrooms and there were thousands of unused materials and resources this was not a school as the year progressed i noticed that the classrooms were nearly empty the students were just scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food they were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying this was not a school and then there were the teachers who were incredibly afraid for their own safety they had low expectations for the students and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school 's culture this was the most troubling of all and not just about her school for far too many schools for kids who live in poverty their schools are really not schools at all anybody who 's ever worked with me will tell you i am known for my slogans i am going to use three that have been paramount in our quest for change my first slogan is if you 're going to lead lead i and having that title required me to lead whether that made me liked so i know i cannot do anything alone we tackled the small things like resetting every single locker combination by hand so that every student could have a secure locker we took the chains off the front doors of the school we got the lightbulbs and we cleaned every classroom to its core we used two dumpsters we tackled entire school budget honors courses we created a deployment plan and we monitored at every second was a behavior system designed to promote positive behavior at all times the results strawberry mansion was removed from the persistently dangerous list our first year after being leaders now what and we met with the staff there were many excuses for why strawberry mansion was low performing and persistently dangerous that only sixty eight percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis one hundred percent of them live in poverty one percent of the parents participate many of the children come from incarceration and single parent homes percent of the students have special needs and the state data revealed that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra and ten were proficient in literature after they got through telling us all the stories of now what what are we gonna do about eliminating excuses every turn became my primary responsibility paving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning after many observations what we determined was that teachers knew what to teach but they did not know how to teach so many children with so many vast abilities developed a lesson delivery model for instruction that focused on small group instruction making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom state data revealed that our scores have grown by one hundred and seventy one percent in algebra and one hundred and seven percent in literature we have a very long way to go a very long way to go but we now approach every obstacle with a so what now what attitude and that brings me to my third and final slogan if nobody told you and i always will my students have problems social emotional and some are completely alone if someone asked me my real secret for how i truly keep strawberry mansion moving forward i would have to say that i love my students and i believe in their possibilities unconditionally and that is because because i grew up poor in north philadelphia too i know what it feels like to wonder if there 's ever going to be any way out of poverty i got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me so if i 've got to get to know who they are so i have to spend time with them so i manage the lunchroom every day and while i 'm there i talk to them i sing happy birthday even though i cannot sing at all i often ask them why do you want me to sing when i cannot sing at all and they respond by saying because we like feeling special we hold monthly town hall meetings to listen to their concerns to find out what is on their minds they ask us why can 't we just do what we want to do and this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions every moment in my rules and consequences is their earned respect and because of this we can accomplish things together and i repeat those expectations every day over the p a system i remind them i remind them of those core values and i remind them every day how education can truly and i end every announcement the same if nobody told you and i always will ashley 's words this is not a school is forever etched in my mind if we are truly going to make real progress in addressing poverty then we have to make sure that every school that serves children in poverty is a real school a school them with knowledge and mental training to navigate the world around them but what i do know is for those of us we must truly lead now what what are we going to do about it we must never forget that every single one of our students is just a child often scared by and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be we should always provide them with hope our undivided attention and we must tell them often thank you"
