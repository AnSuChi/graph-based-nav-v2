  "transcript": "and at this age my personal idol was flipper the dolphin and when i first learned about endangered species i was truly and it would be thirty years but i would eventually get the answer to that question when these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the gulf of mexico last year during the horrific bp oil spill a german biologist by the name of silvia gaus was quoted as saying we should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released and i could not disagree more in addition i believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life and i want to tell you why i feel so strongly about this spilling one thousand three hundred tons of fuel which polluted the habitats of now the ship sank between robben island to the south half of which died now when the treasure sank in two thousand it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the african penguin which at the time was listed as a threatened and soon nearly twenty thousand penguins were covered with this toxic oil the local seabird rescue center named sanccob immediately launched a massive rescue operation and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken aquarist at the new england aquarium it was estelle van der merwe calling from sanccob saying please come help we have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing but completely and we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them so two days later i was on a plane headed for cape town with a team of penguin specialists and the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal in fact many people compared it to a war zone last week a 10 year old girl asked me what did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw and this is what happened i was instantly transported back to that moment in time penguins are very vocal birds and really really noisy so i expected to walk into this building and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking but instead when we stepped through those doors and into the building up to one thousand people a day came to the rescue center eventually over the course of this rescue more than thousand volunteers came from all over the world to cape town to help save these birds and the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there yet they were so for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe inspiring so the day after we arrived two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two room two had more than four thousand oiled penguins in it now mind you three days earlier we had sixty penguins under our care so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified at least i was because we all knew that just half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued and only half of them had survived so would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins we just did not know but what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers three of whom here are force feeding penguins you may notice they 're wearing very thick gloves and what you and the rescuers despaired because they knew if the oil hit it would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds and there really were no good solutions but then finally one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea he said ok why don 't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled they collected twenty thousand and we 'll ship them five hundred miles up the coast and the main thing learned during the apollo sea rescue six years between these two oil spills they 've built thousands of these well ventilated boxes and as a result during the treasure rescue just one hundred and sixty penguins died during the transport process as opposed to five thousand so this alone was a huge victory but so penguins learn from previous experience too so all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin and this brings me to my favorite story from the treasure rescue about a year prior to this oil spill a so i just think it is the coolest thing that a teenager invented a product that helped save the lives of thousands of well she could not be more wrong after half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor more than ninety percent of those oiled penguins were successfully returned to the wild and we know from follow up studies that they have lived just as long as never oiled penguins and bred nearly as successfully and in addition about three thousand penguin chicks were rescued and hand raised and again we know from long term monitoring that more of these chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do eighty percent success rate this is critically important because one year ago the african penguin was declared endangered and they could be extinct in less than ten years if we don 't do something now to protect them personally i learned that i am capable of handling so much more than i ever dreamed possible and i learned that one person can make a huge difference just look at that 17 year old so i 'd like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge if you will and simply put if penguins are and we ultimately will be affected because as sylvia earle says the oceans are our life support system and the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming and these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about so if we each do our part together we can make a difference thank you"
