  "transcript": "i ran into a group of rough men and one of them came up and offered to show me around the price he quoted was outrageous so i clambered into his trishaw and he began pedaling us slowly between palaces and pagodas and as he did he told me how he had come to the city from his village and so for now this was the only way he could make a living many nights he told me he actually slept in his and very soon we found that in certain ways we had so much in common we were both in our 20s we were both fascinated by foreign cultures that he invited me we turned off the wide crowded streets and we began bumping down rough wild alleyways there were i could get mugged or drugged finally he stopped and led me into a hut and reached under his bed and finally he extracted a box inside it so when we said goodbye that night i realized he had also shown me the secret point of travel which is to take a plunge to go even fear it 's dangerously easy to assume we 're on top of things out in the world you are reminded every moment that you 're not and you can 't get to the bottom of things everywhere people wish to be settled ralph waldo emerson reminded us but only insofar as we are unsettled is there any hope for us but at some point and that is the moment when your life is truly decided you fall in love you lose a friend and it 's then when you 're lost or uneasy or carried out of yourself that you find out who you are i can count that out on my fingers any time of night or day but when a mathematician tells me that minus three times minus three makes nine that 's a kind of logic that almost feels like trust it 's also the things i don 't know that have often brought me closer to everybody around me and the one thing he said every day that most seemed to give people reassurance and confidence was i don 't know what 's going to happen to tibet when are we ever going to get world peace what 's the best way to raise children and his conclusion is that we are always much more confident of what we think we know than we should be we have as he memorably puts it and we only remember that knowledge on the rare occasions when we 're right and that 's where real intimacy lies do you know what your lover is going to do tomorrow do you want to know the parents of us but the minute they began nibbling from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil they fell from their innocence they grew embarrassed and fretful and they learned a little too late perhaps that there are certainly some things that we need to know there are many many more that are better left unexplored writing articles for time its soul but underneath all that something that i couldn 't understand so moved me for reasons i couldn 't explain to you yet that i decided to go and live in japan and in the process looking around the corner and seeing the hundred thousand things i 'll never know thinking that you know your lover or your enemy can be more treacherous than acknowledging you 'll never know them every morning in even when the day is bright and the one thing that i have learned is that transformation comes when i 'm not in charge when i don 't know what 's coming and the same is true in love and we 're the first law of travel and therefore of life you 're only as strong as your readiness to surrender in the end perhaps being human thank you"
