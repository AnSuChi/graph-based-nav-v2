  "transcript": "i 've spent my life working on sustainability i worked on development and agriculture issues in the u n system in total and then three years ago i found myself talking to ikea 's ceo about joining his team i want to maximize my personal impact in the world so i 'm going to explain why i joined the team there but first let 's just take three numbers the first number is three three billion this is the number of people joining the global middle class by two thousand and thirty coming out of poverty it the second number is six this is six degrees centigrade what we 're heading towards in terms of global warming we 're not heading towards one degree or three and we need co2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down it the third number is twelve that 's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born you can see my grandmother there that was in the beginning of the last century nearly with a million people or more in them and if you look at the century from one thousand nine hundred and fifty to two thousand and fifty that 's the century when we build all the world 's cities and this lays down a blueprint for how we live and changing the climate like never before sustainability has gone from a nice to do to a must do and for the rest of our working so i 'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like ikea can do and we have a sustainability strategy called people and planet positive to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business other companies have sustainability strategies i 'm going to refer to some of those as going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we 've got we know from asking people from china to the u s that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day to day issues but they want it to and we had it wasn 't a great start affordable or expensive wasting energy every time you switch them on change them after this or whether we have them on the stage here at ted or not but those old incandescent light bulbs so think about that you 'll change your smartphone seven or eight times probably more if you 're in this audience you 'll change your car if you have one three or four times your kids could go to school go to college go away and have kids of their own come back bring the grandkids you 'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy so leds are fantastic what we decided to do was not to sell on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs the halogens and the cfls because then you stop investing you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy and we can and will go zero waste but we 're still dependent on natural raw let 's take cotton and there you can halve the amount of water and halve and sixty percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes again we 're going all in by two thousand and fifteen we 'll be one hundred percent better cotton take the topic of one hundred percent targets actually we found one hundred percent is easier to do than ninety percent or fifty percent if you have a ninety percent target everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the ten percent when it 's one hundred percent it 's kind of clear so wood we know with forestry illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale or you can have fantastic responsible forestry that we can be proud of so hundreds of others of ngos of forest workers ' unions and of businesses have helped create the forest stewardship council which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry 's good on the ground through our supply chain with partners we 've managed to certify thirty five million hectares of forestry and we 've decided in the next three years we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business i think we know so we 're going one hundred percent renewable by two thousand and twenty we 'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume but but then we 've got to look and i think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain but not every business far from it and this came in ikea actually in the ' 90s we found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain and people in the business were shocked and it was clearly totally unacceptable and now we have eighty auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor you 've got to say that 's not enough so what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights we 've worked with unicef and save the children increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these but actually in a survey many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children so what we decided to do was we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children we also have a foundation you can manage what you measure you should measure what you care about if you 're not measuring things you don 't care and you don 't know isn 't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women seventeen thousand managers across ikea so the message here is measure what you care about and lead the change and don 't wait a hundred years so we 've gone from sustainability being a nice to do to a must do it 's a must do it 's but it 's a must do and vote the companies that are acting on this i mentioned renewable energy you go to google or lego they 're going one hundred percent renewable too in the same way that we are on having really good sustainability strategies patagonia timberland marks & spencer but i don 't think any of those businesses would say they 're perfect we certainly wouldn so if you 're a business leader if you 're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model i 'd urge you to do so and together we can help create a sustainable world thank you"
