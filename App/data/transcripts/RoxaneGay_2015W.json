  "transcript": "i have passionate opinions about gender equality but i worry that to freely accept the label of feminist would not be fair to good feminists i 'm a feminist but i 'm a rather bad one and then i wrote a book called bad feminist and then in interviews people started calling me the bad feminist so what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself and a willful provocation has become a thing let me take a step back when i was younger mostly in my teens and i had strange ideas about feminists as hairy angry women as if those are bad things but back then i worried about the tone people used when suggesting i might be a feminist the feminist label was an accusation it was an f word and not a nice one i was labeled a woman who doesn 't play by the rules who expects too much who thinks far too highly of myself by daring to believe i 'm equal superior to a man you don 't want to be that rebel woman until you realize that you very much are that woman and cannot imagine being anyone else i hold certain truths to be self evident women are equal to men we deserve equal pay for equal work we have the right we have to consider the other identities we inhabit we are not just women gender i hold these truths to be self evident but let me be clear i 'm a mess i am full of contradictions i have another confession when i drive to work i listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume even though the lyrics are degrading to women these lyrics offend me to my core the classic yin yang twins song salt shaker it is amazing make it work with your wet t shirt bitch you gotta shake it ' til your camel starts to hurt think about it poetry right i am utterly mortified by my music choices i firmly believe in man work which is anything i don 't want to do including but also bug killing trash removal lawn care and vehicle maintenance i want no part of any of that if a woman wants to take her husband 's name that is her choice and it is not my place to judge if a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children i embrace that choice too the problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice the problem is that our society is set up to make women economically vulnerable when they choose let 's deal with that i reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color working class women queer women and transgender women in favor of supporting white straight women listen if that 's good feminism i am a very bad feminist we have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal we expect them to pose perfectly when they disappoint us we gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on i am a mess consider me knocked off that pedestal before you ever try to put me up there i am a feminist for fear of what that label means for fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations take for example beyonc or as i call her the goddess she has emerged in recent years as a visible feminist at the two thousand and fourteen mtv video music awards she performed in front of the word feminist ten feet high it was a glorious spectacle to see this pop star openly embracing feminism and letting young women and men know that being a feminist is something to celebrate accomplished woman at her word we do not need to do that bad feminism or really more inclusive feminism is a starting if i listen to degrading music i am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limitless supply these artists are not going to change how they talk about women in their songs until we demand that change by affecting their bottom why must it be so catchy but when i justify bad choices i make it harder for women to achieve equality the equality that we all deserve and i need to own that i want them to thrive in a world where they are valued for the powerful creatures they are we can change the channel when a television show treats sexual violence against women like sport game of we can stop supporting professional sports where the athletes treat their partners like punching bags i won 't work with you until your publication or your organization is more inclusive of all kinds of difference those of us who are underrepresented and invited to participate in such projects can also decline to be included until more of us are invited through we can commit these small acts of bravery and hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power we can also boldly claim our feminism good bad or anywhere in between the last line of my book bad feminist says i would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all this is true for so many reasons but first and foremost i say this because once upon a time my voice was stolen from me and feminism helped me to get my voice back back some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a girl but i had writing i read the words of women who showed me i was not nothing and then i learned to write as myself i found my voice again and i started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are i hold the humbling reality that i am just one woman"
