  "transcript": "it happens right here in the democratic republic of congo so let me give you a it is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the that 's why i first went to congo in two thousand and one i was a young humanitarian aid worker and i met this woman who was my age she was called isabelle local militias had attacked isabelle 's village and then they wanted to take isabelle but her husband stepped in please don 't take isabelle take me instead it 's because of people like isabelle and her husband that i have devoted my career to studying this war that we know so little about it 's a story about minerals and rape policy statements and media reports both usually focus on a primary cause of violence in congo the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources and on a main consequence sexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war so not that these two issues aren 't important and tragic they are but today i want to tell you a different story i want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause of the ongoing conflict violence in congo is in large part driven by local bottom up conflicts that international peace efforts have failed but it is also home to some of the largest international peacebuilding efforts in the world congo hosts the largest and most expensive united nations peacekeeping mission in the world it was also the site of the first european led peacekeeping mission the international criminal court chose to prosecute congolese warlords when congo held the first free national elections in its history many observers thought that an end to violence in the region had finally come the international community lauded the successful organization of these elections but the eastern provinces have continued to face massive population displacements and horrific human rights violations before i went back there last summer there was a horrible massacre in the province of south kivu and many of them were hacked to death during the past eight years fighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited full scale civil and international war why why have the massive international efforts failed to help congo achieve lasting peace and security well my answer to this question revolves around two central observations first one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in congo is fundamentally local and when i say local i really mean at the level of the individual the family the clan the municipality the community the district sometimes the the reason why militias had attacked isabelle 's village was because they wanted to take the land the second central observation is that international peace efforts have failed to help address local conflicts because of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture so what i mean is that western and african diplomats united nations peacekeepers the staff of most nongovernmental organizations that work with the resolution of conflict they all share a specific way of seeing the so i know all too well how powerful it is this common culture shapes the intervener 's understanding of the causes of violence as something that is primarily located in the national and international it shapes our understanding of the path toward peace even more importantly they interpret continued fighting and massacres as a to them the violence they see is rwanda and uganda in addition these international peacebuilders view local conflicts as simply the result and what they call the congolese people 's so called inherent penchant for violence the dominant culture also constructs intervention at the national and international levels as the only natural and legitimate task for united nations staffers and diplomats and it elevates the organization of general elections which is now a sort of cure all and that happens not only in congo but also in many other conflict zones let 's dig deeper into the other main sources of violence continuing violence is motivated not only by the national and international causes but also by longstanding bottom up agendas whose main instigators are villagers traditional chiefs community chiefs or ethnic leaders many conflicts revolve around political social and economic stakes that are distinctively local there is a lot of competition at the village or district level and who can control the distribution of land and the exploitation of local mining sites this competition often results in localized fighting for instance in one village or territory and quite frequently it escalates into generalized fighting so across a whole province and even at times into neighboring countries take the conflict between congolese of rwandan when both communities competed over access to land and to local power it escalated because each camp tried to align with national politicians and then at the time of the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four genocide in rwanda but still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the kivus and since then these local disputes over land and local power have fueled violence and they have regularly jeopardized so we can wonder why in these circumstances and the answer is that international interveners deem the resolution of grassroots conflict and it threatens key organizational interests the very identity of the united nations as this macro level diplomatic organization would be upended if it were to refocus on local conflicts and the result is that neither the internal resistance to the dominant ways of working nor the external shocks have managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate their understanding of violence and intervention so to wrap up the story i just told you is a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture shapes the intervener 's understanding of what the causes and what interventions should accomplish peacebuilders the resulting inattention to local conflicts leads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term and potential war resumption in the long term and what 's fascinating is that this analysis helps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict and international intervention failures in africa and elsewhere local conflicts fuel violence in most war and these attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable which benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives where peacebuilding has been mostly top down and so if we want international peacebuilding to must be resolved from the bottom up it is it is that both so of course there are obstacles local actors often lack the funding and sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity to implement effective local peacebuilding programs so actors should expand their funding and support for local conflict resolution based on my field research i believe that international and congolese actors should pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict so for instance in the province of the kivus the life and peace institute and its congolese partners have set up forums to discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence but because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence they could definitely be"
