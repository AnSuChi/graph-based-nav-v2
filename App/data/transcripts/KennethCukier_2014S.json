  "transcript": "you look at supermarket sales you look at supermarket sales of 30 centimeter pies that are frozen but then supermarkets started selling smaller and suddenly apple fell to fourth or fifth place why what happened okay you can get your first choice it allows us to it allows us to see now you probably all have heard the term big data it is true that there is a lot of hype around the term and that is very unfortunate because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance more than we ever could before what we find is that when we have a large body of data we can fundamentally do things that we couldn 't do when we only had smaller amounts big and big data is new and when you think about it electricity and to make sure they 're not burnt to a crisp because of global warming so what is new about big data what is the big to answer that question let 's think about what information looked like physically looked like in the past in one thousand nine hundred and eight on the island of crete archaeologists discovered a clay disc but the point is that this is what information used to look like four thousand years ago this is how society stored and transmitted information society hasn 't advanced all that much but now we can store a lot more information more than ever before and what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data in this respect the data has gone from a stock to a flow from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid there is if you will a liquidity to information the disc that was discovered off of crete that 's four thousand years old is heavy and that information is unchangeable by contrast all of the files that edward snowden took from the national security agency in the united states fits on a memory stick the size of a fingernail more now one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that we 've always collected information on but another reason why is we 're taking things that have always been informational but have never been rendered into a data think for example the question of location take for example martin luther if we wanted to know in the 1500s where martin luther was but now think about what it looks like today you know that somewhere probably in a telecommunications carrier 's database there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry and that cell phone has gps but even if it doesn 't have gps it can record your information in this respect location has been datafied now think for example of the issue of the way that you are all sitting right now and it 's a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back i could create an index that 's fairly unique to you so what could we do with this researchers in tokyo and maybe the engine just stops unless you type in a i have authorization to what could we do then maybe if we aggregated the data maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict and then what we wake up pay more attention to the road these are the sorts of things we can do when we datafy more aspects of our lives well think about it you can do things that you couldn 't do before one of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which itself is a branch of computer science the general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what do do we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself he played arthur samuel knew so he wrote a small sub program alongside it operating in the background and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move he plays the computer it collects more data and this idea of machine learning is going everywhere how do you think we have are we any better off as a society but that 's not why it 's because we changed the nature of the problem we changed the nature of the problem from one in which that that means that you need to stop and not go forward amazon 's personalization researchers recently have looked at and they 've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not sure enough when you throw the data at it through a machine learning algorithm the machine was able to identify the twelve telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous the medical literature only knew nine of them of the traits were ones that people didn 't need to look for but that the machine spotted there are dark sides to big data as well it will improve our lives but there are problems that we need to be conscious of and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions that the police may use big data for their purposes and the idea is that if we take a lot of data for example where past crimes have been we know where to send the patrols it 's going to go down to the level of the individual why don 't we use data maybe we should use the fact that they 're unemployed or not their credit score their web surfing behavior whether they 're up late at night their fitbit when it 's able to identify biochemistries will show that they have aggressive thoughts we may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do and we may be held accountable before we 've actually acted privacy was the central challenge in a small data era in the big data age the challenge will be safeguarding free will there is another problem big data is going to steal our jobs big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar professional knowledge work in the 21st century in the same way that factory automation and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the 20th century think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether it 's cancerous or not the person went to and that person 's job as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person is going to find that their jobs are radically changed now we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short so we 're going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs our very human needs businesses collect lots of data and they misuse it too and we need to get better at this and this will take time it 's a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire this is a tool but this is a tool that unless we 're careful will burn us how we work and how we think it is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction and hope but in the past we 've often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the t the technology the hardware because that 's what was physical but in some ways a lot more important humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect as part of our timeless quest and that 's why big data is a big deal"
