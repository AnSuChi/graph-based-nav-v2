  "transcript": "what is the origin of the forms that we design what kind of forms if we had no bias if we had no preconceptions what would these unseen forms look like would they surprise us would they intrigue us would they delight us if so then how can we go about creating something that is truly and i 'm not saying that we should copy nature i 'm not saying we should mimic biology we can abstract them and to create something that is new nature 's main process of creation morphogenesis is the splitting of one cell into two cells and these cells can or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division then we could start with a single sheet of paper one surface and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces we 're free to choose where we make the fold and by doing so we can differentiate the surfaces through this very simple we can create an astounding variety of forms and in doing so we can suddenly fold anything we can fold a million times faster we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations and as we 're seeking to make something three dimensional if we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again we end up with four hundred thousand surfaces and a shape that looks for instance like this and if we change where we make the folds if we change the folding ratio we can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions we can begin to sculpt the form we can make folds that we otherwise could not make and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can i didn 't design the form i designed the process that generated the form but that 's only half of the story ninety nine point nine percent of the folding ratios produce not this but this the geometric equivalent of noise the forms that i showed before were made actually through very long trial and error a far more effective way to create forms i have found is to use information that is already contained in forms a very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye so for instance we can plot the length of the edges how radial they are but that we can bring out that we can articulate and that we can use to control the folding so now i 'm not specifying a but instead i 'm establishing a rule i 'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and because i 've designed the process and not the form i can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms but the process is a very minimal one there is a simple input it 's always a cube that i start with and it 's a very simple operation it 's making a fold i chose to design a column columns are architectural archetypes they 've been used throughout history to express ideals about about beauty about technology i started using four cylinders through a lot of experimentation these cylinders eventually evolved and these columns we can begin to zoom into them these forms are undrawable an architect who 's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months or it would take even a year to draw all the sections all of the elevations you can only create something like this through an algorithm the more interesting question perhaps is are these forms imaginable usually an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he there 's too many surfaces there 's too much detail one can 't see the end state so this leads to a new role for the architect one needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there for one thing one can design many variants of about crossing and breeding to come up with a design but enough of the theory at one point i simply wanted to jump inside this image so to say i bought these and blue 3d glasses got up there 's been a lot of talk now about about 3d printing for me or for my purpose at this moment there 's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale thinly stacked over each other viewed from the top unbeknownst to me at the time because we had only seen the outside the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves to grow on the inside of the column which was quite a surprising discovery from this shape we calculated a cutting line and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce and you 're seeing a segment of it here very many thin slices individually cut on top of each other but it was very labor intensive there 's a huge disconnect at the moment still the virtual and the physical it took me several months to design the column but ultimately it takes the computer about thirty seconds to calculate all of the sixteen million faces the physical model on the other hand and the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again but it is increasingly possible machines are getting faster it 's getting less expensive and there 's some promising technological developments just on the horizon we used the bigger faster machine and they have a steel core inside so they they 're they can bear loads for once each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns i think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object but a process to generate objects i 've shown one simple process that was inspired by we have no constraints instead we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at at all scales that we couldn 't even have dreamt up and if i may add at one point we will build them"
