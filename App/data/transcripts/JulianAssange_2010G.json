  "transcript": "it 's been reported that wikileaks your baby has in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world 's media combined can that possibly be true that the rest of the world 's media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information ca how does it work how do people release the documents and how do you secure their privacy ja so these are and we have a number of ways for them to get pass it through legal jurisdictions like sweden and belgium to enact those legal protections the regular postal mail encrypted or not vet it like a regular news organization format it which is sometimes something that 's quite hard to do when you 're talking about giant databases of information release it to the public and then defend ourselves ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks ca but you you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible so this was a story in kenya a few years ago can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ja so this is the kroll report this was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the kenyan government after its election in two thousand and four prior to two thousand and four kenya was ruled by daniel arap moi for about eighteen years he was and when kibaki got into power through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya they commissioned this report spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report and then the government sat on it it 's the holy grail of kenyan journalism so i went there in two thousand and seven and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election december twenty eight when we released that report we did so three days after the new president kibaki so this report then became a dead albatross around president kibaki 's neck ca and i mean to cut a long story short word of the report leaked into kenya not from the official media but indirectly and in so this became front page of the guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of kenya in tanzanian and and so it came in from the outside and that after a couple of days made the kenyan press feel safe to talk about it and it ran for twenty nights straight on kenyan tv shifted the vote by ten percent according to a kenyan intelligence report going to just show a short clip from this the video itself is longer but here 's a short clip this is this is intense material i should warn on the people who worked on it was so this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene ca so i mean eleven people died in that attack right including two reuters employees ja yeah two reuters employees two i guess people can see the gross disparity in force you have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street and then an apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing cannon shells on everyone looking for any excuse to do so and there was two journalists involved that clearly weren 't insurgents because that 's their full time job ca and it 's alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you along with two hundred and eighty thousand classified with obtaining one hundred and fifty thousand cables and releasing fifty now we had released early in the year a cable from but this is not necessarily connected if you did receive thousands of u s embassy diplomatic cables ja we would have released them that 's the sort of material that 's there ca what 's your philosophy why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ja well there 's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world what sort of information can achieve and there 's a lot of information so information that organizations are spending that 's a really good signal that when the information gets out there 's a hope of it doing some good because the organizations that know it best that know it from the inside out are spending work to conceal it and that 's what we 've found in practice and that 's what the history of journalism is ca but either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ja not that we have seen with anything we have released i mean we have a harm immunization policy we have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal personally identifying information in it but there are legitimate your records with your doctor that 's a legitimate secret but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well motivated ca so they are well motivated and what would you say to for example the you know the parent of someone whose son is is out serving the u s military and he says you know what you 've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out it shows a u s soldier laughing at people dying the impression has given the impression to millions of people around the world that u s soldiers are inhuman people actually they 're not my son isn 't how dare you what would you say to that ja yeah the people in baghdad the people in iraq the people in afghanistan so it 's not going to change their opinion it 's not going to change their perception that 's what they see every day and that 's our hope ca so you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government light is good any irony in the fact that in order for you to shine that light you have to yourself create secrecy around your sources ja not really i mean we don 't have any wikileaks dissidents yet we should they come forward that would be a tricky situation for us but we 're presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission not to screw it up ca i 'd actually be interested just based on what we 've heard so far i 'm curious as to the opinion in the ted audience hero people 's hero bringing julian a soft crowd we have to try better let 's show them another example now here 's something that you haven 't yet leaked but i think i think for ted you are i mean it 's an intriguing story that 's just happened right what is this this is so late last year in november last year there was a series of well blowouts in albania and we got a report a sort of engineering analysis into what happened saying that in fact security guards from parked trucks there and blown them up and part of the albanian government was in this etc etc and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it so it was an extremely difficult document for us we couldn 't verify it because we didn 't know who wrote it and knew what it was about so we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up the material looks good it feels right but we just can 't verify it and we then got a letter just this week wanting to track down the source to track down the source and we were like oh tell us more what document is it precisely you 're talking about can you show that you had legal authority over that document is it really yours so they sent us this screen shot with the author in the microsoft word that 's happened quite a lot though this is like one of our methods of identifying of verifying what a material is is to try and get these guys to write letters ca yeah have you had information from inside bp ja yeah we have a lot but i we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort so our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we 're re engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth and that means we 're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don 't have enough people to actually process and vet this information ca so that 's the key bottleneck basically journalistic volunteers and or the funding of journalistic salaries ja yep yeah and trusted people i mean we 're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we we deal with so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff and then lower security cases ca can that be right ja well my parents were in the movie business and you were also i mean you were also a hacker at was a very young journalist activist at an early age i wrote a magazine was prosecuted for it when i was a teenager so you have to be careful with hacker i mean there 's like there 's a method it 's mostly deployed by the russian mafia in order to steal your so this phrase is not not as nice as it used to be ca yeah well i certainly don 't think you 're stealing anyone 's can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them and that 's something from my father and something from other so i 'm not actually so big on the nurture but some way there is another way of nurturing victims which is to police perpetrators of crime and so that is something that has been in my character for a long time ca so just tell us you basically published something there ran into trouble with a bank then the news service there was injuncted from running the story instead they publicized your side that made you very high profile in iceland what happened next ja yeah this is a great case you know iceland went through this financial anyway so we release this report in in july and the national tv station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air like out of a movie injunction landed on the news desk and the news reader was like this has never happened before what do we do well we just show the website instead for all that time as and there was a feeling in the community that working with icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts we put together a new sort of package of legislation for iceland to sort of become an an offshore haven for the free press with the strongest journalistic protections in the world with a new and just a month ago this was passed by the icelandic parliament unanimously when you think of the future then do you think it 's more likely to be big brother exerting more control more secrecy or us watching big brother or it 's just all to be played for either way ja i i mean there 's enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world which way is it going to go it 's hard to see that 's why it 's a very interesting time to be in because with just a little bit of effort we can shift it be careful and all"
