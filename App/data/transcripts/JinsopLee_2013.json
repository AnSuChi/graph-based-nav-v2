  "transcript": "in an age of i 'm here to answer the all important question why is sex so damn good if you 're laughing you know what i mean now before we get i hate him here 's why back in university we had a quick project to design some solar powered clocks here 's my clock so in and in the evening again and that 's your clock but it does give you a general idea using a flower so in my completely unbiased subjective opinion it 's brilliant here 's chris 's clock it 's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one in each shot glass is a different scented oil focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath this will warm up the scented oil inside and a particular smell will be emitted a so during the course of the day anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell this problem 's been bugging me for well over a decade all right let 's get back to the question of why sex many years after the solar powered clocks project i devised something called the five senses graph along the y axis you have a scale from zero i would record it on this graph like a five senses diary here 's a quick video to show you how it works not just me but also some of my friends i used to teach in university so i forced my i mean i asked my students to do this as well so here are some other results but notice sound is at three you know needless to say i no longer dine with these people here what i found interesting was that taste is at four and many respondents told me it 's because of the taste of drinks but also in some cases kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience these people i still do hang out with all right here i found touch is at [ six ] and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience which shows it 's kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers ok now what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph it would of course be a horizontal in the years that i gathered data only one experience came close to being the perfect one that is of course sex great sex respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level here it 's good even when it 's bad so the five senses theory does here 's chris 's clock it 's the first clock ever that uses which means we 've ignored the other three senses chris 's clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product here 's three quick ideas i came up with this is an iron you know for your clothes to which i added a spraying mechanism so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent and your clothes will smell nicer but hopefully it should also make the ironing and when the taste of candy ran out you 'd know it 's time to change your toothbrush i have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet it i don 't play the flute or the so i decided to combine these keys with an instrument i do play the television remote control so in conclusion i 've found the five senses theory to be a very useful i realize the five senses isn 't the only thing that makes life interesting there 's also the six emotions and that elusive x factor until then here 's the experience you all had while listening to the ted talks however it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste and the best way to do that is with you guys ready"
