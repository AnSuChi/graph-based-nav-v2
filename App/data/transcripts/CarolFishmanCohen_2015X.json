  "transcript": "i call them relaunchers pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue closely related are career transitioners of all kinds veterans military spouses retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers especially if they 've been out for a long time this disconnect is a problem that i 'm trying to help solve now successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field this he 's a nuclear physicist in the uk who took a five year career break to be home with his five children and speaking of long career breaks this is mimi kahn she 's a social worker in orange county california who returned to work in a social services tracy answered a call for essays by the today show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we 've put in a good day in the job search and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online i met tracy in june of two thousand and eleven when the today show asked me if i could work with her to see if i could help her turn things around i also told her expect that and don 't be discouraged by it there will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity i 'll and that is that people 's view of you is frozen in time what i mean by this is when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past the people with whom you worked or went to school and that 's even if your sense of self has diminished over time as happens with so many of us the farther so for example you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this this is me crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan or but those people from the past they don 't know about any of this and it 's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work and that was that i hardly kept up with the business news my background is in finance and i hardly kept up with any news when i was home caring for my four so i had to resubscribe to the wall street journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before i felt like i had a handle on what was going on in the business world again and here 's why think about our life stage for those of us who took career we have fewer or no maternity leaves we did that already we have fewer spousal or partner job relocations we 're in a more settled time of life plus we have an an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we 've been away from it for a while on the flip side i speak with employers and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers now i can tell you having been technologically obsolete myself at one point that it 's a temporary i had done my financial analysis so long ago that i used lotus i tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software and if they 're not up to speed then it 's their responsibility to get there and they do i tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break that 's not the employer 's job it 's the relauncher 's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value back in two thousand and ten i started noticing something i had been tracking return to work programs since two thousand and eight and in two thousand and ten i started noticing the use of a i saw a returning engineer a nontraditional reentry candidate apply for an i saw two universities integrate internships into mid career executive education programs and it became this article for harvard business review called the and also for this artwork where you can see the 40 year old intern in the midst of all the college interns courtesy of fox business news they called the concept the 50 year old intern hundreds of people have seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the society of women engineers now why are companies embracing the reentry internship because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews and the employer does not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over think about how far we have come before this most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all but now not only are programs being developed specifically with but you can 't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your rsum different pool so let me tell you what happened with tracy shapiro remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work well but it was a temp job the company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more but no guarantees this was in the fall of two thousand and eleven so even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full time role she decided to take her chances with this internship well she ended up blowing away all of their expectations and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of two thousand and twelve but they made it even more interesting and challenging because they knew what tracy could handle tracy 's been promoted they 've paid for her to get her mba at night she 's even hired another relauncher to work for her tracy 's temp job was a tryout just like an internship and it ended up being a win for both tracy and her employer but in the meantime if you are returning to work after a career break don 't hesitate to suggest an internship or an to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program be their first success story and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come thank you"
