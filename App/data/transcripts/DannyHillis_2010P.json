  "transcript": "i admit that i 'm a little bit nervous here because i 'm going to say some radical things about how we should think about cancer differently to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about but i will also contest that i 'm not as nervous as i should be because i 'm pretty sure i 'm right about this and that this in fact will be the way that we treat cancer in the future in order to talk about cancer i 'm going to actually have to let me get the big slide here first i 'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics i want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on and then talk about something you haven 't heard so much about which is proteomics having explained those that will set up for what i it is the hot topic it is the place where we 're learning the most this is the and if that were only true it would be great but it 's not it so if i can make an analogy let 's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant so it might be that if you went to a french restaurant you could say ah i see what 's wrong with them i can make them healthy and there probably are special cases of that you could certainly tell the difference between a chinese restaurant and a french restaurant by what they had in a larder the list of ingredients does tell you something and sometimes it tells you something that 's wrong you need to taste the food you need to know what goes on in the kitchen you need the product of all of those ingredients if i and so indeed there are times when we can find ingredients that [ are ] bad cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient but most things you really have to know what 's going on in the kitchen so the genome really tells you much more about predisposition so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list but you really for the most part can 't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person except in some of these special cases so why all the big deal about which is fantastic it is very useful in certain circumstances it 's also the great theoretical triumph of biology it 's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right it 's fundamental to darwin and mendel and so on and so it 's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical so mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing and then watson and crick actually looked and found one you predict a black hole and you look out the telescope and there it is just like you said but it rarely happens in biology triumph it 's so good there 's almost a religious experience in biology and darwinian evolution is really the thanks to kary kary mullis you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients we 've learned a lot about how we 're related to other kinds of animals or how we 're related to each other the family tree or the tree of life there 's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity of course in medical application that is very useful because it 's the same kind of information and so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your i did the 23andme thing and was very surprised to discover that i am fat and bald but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that but mostly what you need to know to find out if you 're sick but it 's actually what 's going on in your body right now you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what 's happening after the genetics and that 's what proteomics is about just like genome mixes the study of all the genes proteomics is the study of all the proteins and the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells actually the machines that are operating that 's where the action is basically a human body is a conversation going on both within the cells and between the cells and they 're telling each other to grow and to die and when you 're sick something 's gone wrong with that conversation and so the trick is unfortunately we don 't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome and it matters how much of the protein it is it could be very significant that a protein changed by ten percent so it 's not a nice digital thing like dna and problem is somebody 's in the middle of this very long stage they pause for just a moment and so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way people have tried very hard to do this i tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems i get a call from john doerr bill berkman and al gore on the same day saying return david agus 's phone call patients dying every day because we don 't know what 's going on inside of them we have to have a window into this and he took me through specific and so i said well let 's look at it applied minds has enough play money that so we started playing around with this and as we did it we realized this was the basic problem that taking the sip of coffee that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and so we did that and which makes this robotic assembly line which in a very consistent way measures the protein and i 'll show you what that protein measurement looks like what we do is we take a drop of blood and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh how slippery they are and so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood and we can take a different one tomorrow and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different they 'll be different after you eat or after you sleep they really tell us what 's going on there and so this picture which looks like a big smudge to you i can just show you what it means we sort out the proteins from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we 're getting and from top to bottom is how slippery they are so we 're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it and so each of these lines represents some signal that we 're getting out of a piece of a protein and you can see how the lines occur in these little bump bump bump we actually measure it as a different as so and suddenly you say wow it 's way more complicated than we thought it was but we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it so this is the signature out of which we 're trying to get patterns so what we do with this is for example we can look at two patients one that responded to a drug and one that didn 't respond to a drug and ask what 's going on differently inside of them and so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences so here we have alice in green and bob in red and you can see mostly it overlaps and it 's yellow but there 's some things that just alice has and some things that just bob has and if we find we see that in the blood they have the condition but we can see it 's a marker so i think is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine but i think this is actually just the beginning of of how we 're going to treat cancer so let me move to cancer the thing about cancer i really knew nothing about it but working with david agus i started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out and as i looked at it to me it didn 't make sense how we were approaching cancer and in order to make sense of it i had to learn where did this come from we 're treating cancer almost like it 's an infectious disease we 're treating it as something that got inside so this is the great paradigm this is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked so what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose that is put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis and that works great for infectious diseases so if we put you in the category of you 've got syphilis we can give you penicillin we know that that works if you 've got malaria we give you quinine and it 's miraculous in the case of of infectious disease how well it works and many people in this audience probably wouldn 't be alive if doctors didn 't do this but now let 's apply that to systems diseases like cancer it 's you you 're broken so how do we diagnose that conversation and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body and then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer and we treat these as if they 're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong and of course really doesn 't have that much to do with what went wrong i think cancer should not be a noun we should talk about cancering as something we do not something we have and so those tumors those are symptoms of and the way that we talked about it we 'd come home and we 'd find a leak and then we know that if we sprinkle drano around the kitchen that helps whereas living room water it 's better to do tar on the roof what we really need to get at is the process that 's going on and that 's happening at the level of the proteonomic actions happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally but it 's fixing them it 's draining them out and so on so what we need is to have a causative model of what 's actually going on and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that got me invited to give a talk at national cancer institute and so i gave this talk and said why don 't you guys do this and anna said but what we 're going to do is we 're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research so david and i applied to this program and created a consortium at usc where we 've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world from cold spring harbor austin i won 't even go through and name all the places to have a research project that will last for five years and we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand when so i think eventually once we have one of these models for people which we 'll get eventually i mean our group won 't get all the way there but eventually we 'll have a very good computer model sort of like a global climate model for weather lots of different and so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer and this also will be for als or any kind of system neurodegenerative neurodegenerative diseases things like that we will simulate specifically you not just a generic person but what 's actually going on inside you and in that simulation what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments and it might be very gentle treatments very small amounts of drugs it might be things like don 't eat that day or give them a little chemotherapy maybe a little radiation do surgery sometimes and so on but design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health guide your body back to health because your body and so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer and we just have to prop those up in the right way and so i believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future it 's going to require a lot of work a lot of research there but i think eventually so"
