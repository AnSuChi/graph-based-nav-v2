  "transcript": "it 's about who we are and i can 't help but be such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet now this mystery is not new in thomas huxley wrote how it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when aladdin rubbed his lamp now but he didn 't know why it was a mystery in the years since huxley science has learned a lot about brain activity but the relationship between brain activity and some experts think that we can 't solve this problem and as it happens we can 't expect our species to solve this problem either i 'm more optimistic i think we 've simply made a false assumption once we fix it we just might solve this problem and how to fix it let 's begin with a question i open my eyes and i have an experience that i describe as a red tomato tomato a meter away i then close my eyes and my experience changes to a gray field then we thought that the earth is the unmoving center of galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences in other ways he wrote and so on hence if the living creature were removed all these qualities would be annihilated now that 's a stunning claim could galileo be right neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain 's cortex is engaged in vision when you simply open your eyes and look about this room billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged now this is a bit surprising because to the there is a part of vision that 's like a camera so the eye is like a 't explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision what are these neurons up to in real time all the shapes objects colors and motions that we see it feels like we 're just taking a snapshot of this room the way in this example you see some red discs with bits cut out of them but if i just rotate the disks a little bit suddenly you see a 3d cube pop out of the in this next example you see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots no dots move but when i do this quickly your visual system creates the glowing blue bars with the sharp edges and the motion there are many more examples but these are just two that you construct what you see but neuroscientists go further they say that we reconstruct so when i have an experience that i describe as a red tomato that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tomato that would exist even if i weren 't looking now why would neuroscientists say that we don 't just construct we reconstruct well the standard argument given is usually an evolutionary one those of our ancestors who saw more accurately and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes we are the offspring of those who saw more accurately and so we can be confident that in the normal case our perceptions are accurate you see this in the standard textbooks one textbook says for example evolutionarily speaking vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate so the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions they give you a survival advantage now is this correct is this the right interpretation let 's first look at a couple of examples in nature the australian jewel beetle glossy and brown the male flies looking of course for a hot female homo sapiens the male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer laughter and when he finds one he drains it and sometimes throws the bottle into the outback the males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate lose all interest in the real females classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles but apparently not evolution had given them a hack the bigger the better the male couldn 't discover his mistake but you get the idea so this raises an important technical question we don 't have to wave our hands and guess evolution is a mathematically precise theory we can use the equations of evolution to check this out we can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete and see which survive and which thrive which sensory systems are more fit consider this steak for a hungry lion looking to eat it enhances fitness so fitness does depend on reality as it is but also on the organism its state and its action that figures centrally in the equations of evolution so in my lab we have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations with lots of different randomly chosen worlds only fitness well i hate to break it to you but perception of reality in almost every how can it be that not seeing world accurately gives us a survival advantage that is a bit counterintuitive but remember the jewel beetle using simple tricks and hacks what the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms including us are in the same boat as the jewel beetle we 're shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive still how can not perceiving reality as it is be useful the icon is blue and rectangular and in the lower right corner of the desktop does that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue rectangular and in the lower right hand corner of the computer of course not it 's there to hide that so the idea is that evolution has given us an interface that hides reality space and time as you perceive them right now are your desktop physical objects there 's an obvious objection if you think that train coming down the track at two hundred mph is just an icon of your desktop why don i wouldn 't step in front of that train for the same reason that i wouldn 't carelessly drag that icon to the trash can not because i take the icon literally the file is not literally blue or rectangular similarly evolution has shaped us with if you see a snake don 't pick it up don 't jump off that does not mean that we should take them literally that 's a logical error another objection there 's nothing really new here physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it 's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around not exactly it those microscopic particles are still in space and time so i 'm saying something far more radical than those physicists finally you might object we all see a cube so the cube that you see is the cube that you construct we all see a cube because we all each one of us constructs the cube that we see we all see a train because we each see the train that we construct and the theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation instead reality is more like a 3d desktop that 's designed to hide the complexity of the real world we used to think that the earth is flat we had misinterpreted our perceptions now we believe that the theory of evolution is telling us 're misinterpreting the content there 's something that exists when you don 't look but it 's not spacetime and physical objects it 's why because we 're blind to our own blindnesses but we have an advantage over the jewel beetle our science and technology by peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the earth is not the unmoving center of reality i am interacting with but that reality is not a red tomato when i have an experience that i describe as a lion i am interacting with but that reality is not a brain or neurons and is nothing like a brain or neurons is the real source of cause and effect in the world brains and neurons of symbols a hack it opens up new possibilities perhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences i doubt this but it 's once we let go of our massively intuitive but massively false i bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating and unexpected than we 've ever imagined the theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare it 's about having kids even this ted thank you very much chris if that 's really you there thank you of all some people may just be profoundly depressed at the thought that possibly even including your own theory if you go there donald hoffman well this does not stop us from a successful science what we have is one theory that turned out to be false perception is like so science continues as normal there 's no problem here ca so you think it 's possible the but that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics we haven 't done these simulations but my bet is that we 'll find that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our but at least the selection pressures are not uniformly away from true math and logic so i think that we 'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it and i don 't need to go where berkeley 's going i call this conscious realism it 's actually a very different approach ca don i could literally talk with you for hours and i hope to"
