  "transcript": "understand my english in the mornings it is terrible and the afternoon is worst during many i made some speeches starting with this saying city is not a problem it 's a solution and more and more i 'm convinced but it 's a solution but we have a very pessimistic approach about and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big the other mayors say we don 't have financial resources i would like to say from the experience i had the world can be improved in less than three years every problem in a city has to have its own equation of so i want to introduce some characters the best example of quality of life is the turtle and when you realize that the casque of the turtle and can we imagine if we cut the casque of the turtle how sad she 's going to be and and most of the people are leaving the city the other he is invited for a party the chairs are on the tables and still drinking and he drinks a lot he asks always accordion the friendly bus he three million in the metropolitan area one million eight hundred thousand people 's like two birds kissing themselves and that 's the and this is where we have more density it 's where we have more public transport so this system started in we started with twenty five thousand passengers a day now it 's two and now there 's eighty three cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the brt of curitiba and it 's important besides its normal problems they have a very important role in being with the whole humanity that means mostly two main issues mobility and sustainability are becoming very important for the cities and this is an articulated bus what in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes the boarding tube gives to the bus this is the design of the bus and you can pay before entering the bus you 're boarding and for handicapped they can use this as a normal what i 'm trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars more than fifty percent so when we depend only on cars the design of the city that 's also important too and also how to teach the children i 'll speak on this later on our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems we started in ' eighty three proposing for the city of rio how to connect the subway with the bus the subway was against of course and twenty three years after they called us to develop we 're developing this idea and you can understand how different it 's going to be the image of rio with the system and it 's not shanghai it 's not being colored during the day only at night and before you say it 's a norman foster design what i 'm trying to say is i 'm not trying to prove which system of transport is better i 'm trying to say we have to combine never if you have any kind of system never compete in the same space coming back to the car i always used to say that the car is like your but she cannot command your life so when the only woman the ideas about how to transform through design old quarries and open universities and botanic garden all of it 's related to how we teach the children and the children we teach during six months how to separate their garbage and now we have seventy percent since twenty years it 's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world i would like to say if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with i 'm working in a you should have another issue even if we don 't like the nose of our uncle because this portrait is you and these are the references that we yes you have to be fast references from our ethnic contribution this is the italian portal the the german park all of a sudden the soviet union and since we have people from uzbekistan we have to stop the program don 't forget creativity starts when you cut a zero and this is the wire opera theater we did it in two months old quarries that they were transformed into parks and every part can be transformed every frog can be transformed in a in a city and i 'm proposing urban acupuncture that means me with some focal ideas and this is an acupuncture note or i want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials new sustainable materials but keep in mind that we have to work fast because we don 't have the whole time to plan and i think creativity innovation is starting and we cannot have all the answers so when you start and we we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers it 's important starting and having the contribution from from people and they i would like if you can help me to sing you 're going to make the music and the rhythm separate their garbage"
