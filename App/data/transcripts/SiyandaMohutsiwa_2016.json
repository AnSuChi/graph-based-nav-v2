  "transcript": "it began with one question what would your country be drinking or doing which wasn 't exactly according to the rules because south africa 's i tweeted south africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol and begging them to get along in its stomach and then i waited and then i had that funny feeling where i wondered if i crossed the line so i sent out a few other tweets about my own country and a few other african countries i 'm familiar with and then i waited again but this time i read through almost every tweet i had ever tweeted to convince myself no to remind myself that i 'm really funny and that if nobody gets it that 's fine people were participating in fact by the end of that week in july the hashtag would have garnered around sixty thousand tweets lit up the continent and made its way to publications all over the world people were using the hashtag to do many different things to poke fun at their stereotypes and also to make fun of the countries that don 't think that they 're in africa people were connecting over so for one week in july twitter became a real mainly because i realized that could work that we had before us between us at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other my name is by birth because my parents are from two different african countries my father 's from a country called botswana in southern africa it 50th year of stable democracy and it has some very progressive social policies my mother 's country is the kingdom of swaziland so it 's been ruled by a king and a royal family in line with their tradition for a very long time i could see the difference it rained a lot in one but it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me you see i was born in one country and raised in the other when we moved to botswana so i was being introduced to my new home my new cultural identity i would i would be constantly confronted by how very add to that my entry into africa 's private school system whose entire purpose is to beat the africanness out of you but i think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once but not really belonging to either one very well and belonging to this vast space in since then i have continued to read about politics and geography and identity and what all those things mean i 've also held on to a deep curiosity about african i moved on to the speeches of iconic african statesmen like burkina faso 's thomas sankara and congo 's patrice lumumba i read every piece of african fiction that could get my hands on i hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl whose friends are super super bored of hearing about all this random stuff the year was two thousand and eleven and all over southern africa and the whole continent affordable data so my generation we were sending messages to each other on this platform that just needed one hundred and forty characters and a little bit of creativity on long commutes to work we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realities of being young and african but of course this luxury so this meant that if you were a teenage girl in botswana and you wanted to have fun on the internet one you had to tweet in english two you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online you had to follow south africans zimbabweans ghanaians nigerians and suddenly your whole world opened up and my whole world did open up i followed vibrant africans who were travelling around the continent taking pictures of themselves and posting them under the hashtag # myafrica if you were to search africa on twitter or on google or any kind of social media you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts and these were the same africans that i began to meet in my own travels around the continent we would discuss african literature politics economic policy we would end up discussing twitter and that 's when i realized what this was we were standing in the middle of something amazing because for the first time ever young africans could discuss the future of our continent because the little known truth is many africans know a lot less about other african countries than some westerners might know about africa as a whole but sometimes it 's by design black south africans were constantly being bombarded with this message that any country ruled by black people was destined for failure archaic education system which has been unthinkingly carried over from the i could name all the various causes of the wars that but i couldn 't name the president of my neighboring country and to me this doesn 't make any sense because whether we like it or not the fates of african people are deeply intertwined we share the when burundians flee political turmoil what was once a a burundian problem so if we share the problems doing a better job of sharing the successes but i think that the biggest way for africa to share its successes but political pan africanism is usually the african unity of the political elite and who does that benefit well african leaders almost exclusively no what i 'm talking about is the of the ordinary african but with bad governance and shaky institutions all of this potential could go to waste we are in desperate need of something new something that and i think that thing is social my dream is that young africans stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation my dream is that when a young african comes up with something brilliant they don this wouldn 't work in my country and then give up my dream is that young africans begin to realize that the entire continent is our canvas is our home we can begin to innovate together but if you want to go far you go together and i believe that social pan africanism is how we can go far together access to these online networks has given young africans something we 've always had to violently take if you wanted to hear from the youth in africa you waited for the wake up in the morning take his heartburn medication before now if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government you were pushed to protest suffer the consequences and have your fingers crossed that some western paper somewhere might make someone care we support angolan journalists who are being illegally detained for the first time ever african pain and african aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most thank you"
