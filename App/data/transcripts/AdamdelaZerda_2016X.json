  "transcript": "and we will win this war by two thousand and fifteen this is what the us congress and the national cancer institute declared just just a few years ago in two thousand and three i will argue that a primary reason why we 're not winning this war against cancer is because we 're fighting blindly i 'm going to start by sharing with you a story about a good friend of mine his name is ehud and a few years ago ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer and not just any type of brain cancer he was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer in fact it was so deadly that now the good news they said is that there are tons of different treatments to choose from but the bad news is that in order for them to tell if a treatment is even working or not well that takes them about three months or so so they cannot try that many things and during that first treatment just a few days into that treatment i 'm meeting with him and he tells me adam i think this is working i think we really lucked out here how do you know that ehud and he says well i feel so terrible inside something 's gotta be working up there it just has to and again the same story it feels so bad something 's gotta be working there and then three months later again we get bad news ehud when someone really close to you is going through such a huge struggle you get really swamped with emotions a lot of things are going through your head for me it was mostly outrage i was just outraged that and i started looking more and more into this as it turns out this is not just the best that doctors could offer ehud it 's not just the best doctors could offer i picked up one of those statistics and i 'm sure some of you have seen those statistics before ever since the notice that there aren 't that many things that have changed it 's still a huge issue and you 'll also see that for example stomach cancer once used to be one of the biggest killers of all cancers is essentially eliminated what was the huge huge medical technology breakthrough that came to our world that saved humanity from from stomach cancer or a better diagnostic you guys are right it 's the invention of the refrigerator and the fact that we 're no longer eating spoiled meats so the best thing that happened to us so far in the medical arena in cancer research is the fact that the refrigerator was invented i know we 're not doing so well here i don 't want to miniaturize the progress and and everything that 's been done in cancer research look there is like 50 plus years of good cancer research but all that said we have a lot of heavy lifting to still do ahead of us again i will argue that the primary reason why this is the case why we have not done that remarkably well is really we 're fighting blindly here and this is where medical imaging comes in this is where my own work comes in and so to give you a sense of the best medical imaging that 's offered today to brain cancer patients or actually generally to all cancer patients take a look at this pet scan right here let 's see there we go so this is a pet ct scan and what you 'll see in this pet ct scan is the ct scan will show you where the bones are and the pet scan will show you where tumors are what you can see here is essentially a sugar molecule that was added a small little tag that is and those sugar molecules are injected into these patients by the billions and they 're going all over the body looking for cells that are hungry for sugar you 'll see that the heart for example lights up there that 's because the heart needs a lot of sugar you 'll also see that the bladder lights up there that 's because the bladder is the thing that 's clearing the sugar away from our body and then you 'll see a few other hot spots and these a wonderful technology for the first time it allowed us to look into someone 's body without picking up each and every one of the cells and putting them under the microscope but in a noninvasive way has the cancer metastasized where is it and the pet scans here are showing you very clearly so it 's not that great so it 's about one hundred million cancer cells and let me make sure that this number sunk in in each and every one of these small little blips that you 're seeing on the image there needs to be at least one hundred million cancer cells in order for it to be detected now if that seemed to you like a very large number it is a very large number this is in fact an incredibly large number because what we really need in order to pick up something early enough to do something about it to do something meaningful about it so we 're clearly pretty far away from this so we 're going to play a little experiment here i 'm going to ask each of you to now play and imagine that you are brain surgeons and you guys are now at an operating room and there 's a patient in front of you so you 're looking down at the patient and all you know about this patient there 's a tumor about the size of a golf ball or so in the right frontal lobe of this person 's brain and so you go in and go a little bit like this and say it seems like the then you take out your knife and start cutting the tumor piece by piece by piece and as you 're taking the tumor out then you 're getting to a stage where you think alright i 'm done i took out everything risking that might be some leftover cancer cells behind that i just couldn 't see so this is not a simple and so i remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab and but not just like you tell a friend that there 's got to be a better way there 's just got to be a better way here and so let 's maybe take tiny tiny little particles made of gold and let 's program them with some interesting chemistry around them let 's program them to look for cancer cells and these gold particles into these patients by the billions again and we 'll have them go all over the body and just like secret agents if you will go and walk by every single cell in our body and knock on the door of that cell and ask are you a cancer cell or are you a healthy cell if you 're a healthy cell we 're moving on if you 're a cancer cell we 're sticking in and shining out and telling us and once we see that maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons towards taking only the tumor and leaving the healthy brain alone what you 're looking at here and we 've implanted into this mouse 's brain a small little tumor and so this tumor is now growing in this mouse 's brain and then we 've taken a doctor and asked the doctor to please operate on the mouse as if that was a patient and so we 're going to first start by injecting these gold particles into this mouse and we 're going to see right here at the very left there that image at the bottom is the image that shows where the gold particles that these gold particles actually made it all the way to the tumor and then they shine out and tell us hey we 're here here 's the tumor we 're asking the doctor now please start cutting away the tumor and you 'll see here the doctor just took the first quadrant of the tumor and you see that first quadrant is now missing and so at this stage the doctor came back to us and said alright i 'm done what do you want me to do should i keep things as they are or do you want me to take some extra margins around and then we said well hang on only take out those tiny little areas and lo and behold the cancer is now completely gone now the important thing is that it 's not that the cancer is completely gone from this person 's brain or from this mouse 's brain and so now we can actually imagine a world where doctors and surgeons as they take away a tumor they actually know what to take out and they no longer have to guess with even if it 's just a handful of cells they will grow for the tumor to come back in fact the reason why eighty to ninety percent of those brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail is because of those small little so this is clearly very nice but what i really want to share with you is where i think and so in my lab at stanford my students and i are and i think where medical imaging is heading to is the ability to look into the human body and actually see each and every one of these cells separately the ability like this would allow us to to actually pick up tumors way way earlier in the process way before it 's one hundred million cells inside so we can actually do something about it an ability to to see each and every one of the cells might also allow us to ask insightful questions so in the lab we are now getting to a point where we can actually start asking these these cancer cells real questions like for example are you responding to the treatment we are giving you or not and so also for patients like like ehud that are going through these nasty nasty chemotherapy drugs for them not to suffer through those horrendous side effects of the drugs when the drugs are in fact not even helping them so we 're pretty far away from from winning the war against cancer just to be realistic but thank you"
