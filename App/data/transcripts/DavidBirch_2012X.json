  "transcript": "talk about identity that 's sort of an interesting enough topic to me and the reason was because when i was asked to do this i 'd just read in one of the papers i can 't remember and that 's so wrong that 's such a and he was incarcerated in i think wakefield prison for forging masterpieces by i think so good at it that when he was in prison and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake if you see what i mean so when we 're talking about authenticity i 'm guessing everyone 's got a chip and pin card right that 's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a chip and pin card that 's in your pocket and for a joke we take that super secure chip and we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe and for very lazy criminals we still emboss the card so if you 're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone 's card you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to sort of speed things up and why and if you think about it it 's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first because the only people that benefit from having the name on the card right it 's a pin he doesn 't the only place where you ever have to write your name on the back is in america at the moment and whenever i go to america and i have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card i always sign it carlos tethers anyway just as a security mechanism because i know it must have been a criminal because i would never sign it dave birch and because we 're rooted in the idea of the identity card which obsesses us and i know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago but if you 're so the second example i thought i 'd use is chatrooms [ chatrooms and children ] i 'm very proud of that picture that 's my son playing in his band with his friends for the gig i believe you call it where he got paid laughter and i love that picture i like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better i like that picture watching that experience as an old person and they do it all on and the first band on menu that 's probably the wrong word for it isn 't it the first band on the list of bands that appears at and so on they were at the but my point is that all worked perfectly except i want to go you to go into a chatroom to talk about guitars because they might not all be your friends and some of the people that are in the chatroom might be perverts and teachers and vicars so i want to know who all the people in the chatroom are so okay you can go in the chatroom but only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names and they submit full copies of their police report but of course if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name i 'd say no you can 't give them your real name because what happens if they turn out to be perverts and teachers and whatever and so you get this sort of logjam around identity and it 's a very bad way of thinking about identity i saw this thing about i just said something bad about my rss feed didn 't i i should stop saying it like that for some random reason i can 't and it 's a fascinating story this happened a couple of years ago in the u s there were some cheerleaders in a and so she went to one of the girls and said you have to give me your facebook she was a kid what she should have said is my lawyer will be calling you first thing in the morning it 's an outrageous imposition but she 's a kid so she hands over the password the teacher can 't log because the school has blocked access to facebook and so when the teacher logged in there was nothing there identity is especially when you 're a teenager a fluid the idea that you have an identity that 's given to you by someone the government or whatever and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places that 's absolutely wrong and my fourth example is there are some cases where you really want to that 's me at the and i got an email from the bank saying please don 't wear a suit because it 'll inflame the protesters i look pretty good in a suit frankly so you can see why it would drive them into if i don 't want to inflame the protesters the obvious thing to do is go dressed as a protester so i went dressed completely in black you know with a black balaclava i had black gloves on but i 've taken them off to sign the visitor 's book i 'm wearing black trousers black boots i 'm dressed completely in black i go into the bank at ten o 'clock go hi i 'm dave birch i 've got a three o 'clock with so and so there sure they sign me in there 's my visitor 's badge on facebook and whatever that gets you that kind of security and as long as everybody learns their lines everyone 's happy but it 's not real security especially because i hate banks more than the g20 protesters do because and i want to report it to the boss of the bank so i log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing i send a message this guy 's a rogue trader there 's no point in sending that message but if i have to prove who i am i 'll never send that message it 's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the so the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there otherwise we don 't get where we want to get to so four issues so what are we going to do about it well what we tend to do about it and we try to make electronic versions of the identity card that we got rid of the more times you 're forced to use your real identity certainly in transactional transactional terms the more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted the goal is to stop people from using identity transactions you do are etcetera etcetera suggestion i like james think that there should be a resurgence of interest in r & d i think this is a solvable problem it 's something we can do about i turn to doctor doctor who is the greatest living scientist in england and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us and this is doctor who with his psychic paper you guys must have seen doctor who 's psychic paper you oh right you were in the library the whole time studying i guess is that what you 're going to tell us so i want to show you a british passport i so what i 'm saying is we need to make an electronic version of that but with one tiny tiny change which is that it 'll only show you the british passport if i 've actually got one it but nothing else so you 're the bouncer at the pub you need to know that i 'm over eighteen instead i show you my psychic paper and all it tells you is am i over eighteen or not right is that just a pipe dream of course not otherwise i wouldn 't be here talking to you so in order to build that and make it work i 'm only going to name these things i 'll not go into them which is we 're going to build this as an infrastructure for everybody to use to solve all of these problems we 're going to make a utility so when you want to draw money out you put the mobile phone on the atm and touch your finger your fingerprint goes through to the phone the phone says yes that 's whoever and the atm then gives you some money it has to be a utility that 's me going into the pub and so the idea is you touch your id card to the door and if i am allowed in it shows my picture if i 'm not allowed in it shows a red cross it doesn 't disclose any other information it has to have no special gadgets that can only mean one thing following on from ross 's statement which i agree with completely i don 't know what i rely on our futurologists to tell me it has to be a utility which is extensible so it has to be something that anybody could build on anybody should be able to use this infrastructure you don 't need permissions licenses whatever anyone should be able to write some code to do this you know what symmetry is so you don 't need a picture of it this is how we 're going to do it we 're going to do it using phones and we 're going to do it using mobile proximity i 'm going to suggest to you and if any of you have got one of the new barclay 's debit cards with the contactless interface on it you 've already got that technology the first phones that have the technology built in the google nexus the s2 the samsung wifi seven point nine the first phones that have the technology built into them are already in the shops so the idea that the gas man can turn up at my mom 's door and he can show my mom his phone and she can tap we have the technology to do that and what 's more although some of those things sounded a bit it 's extremely well known and well understood digital signatures a few examples of the technology being used in experimental places that 's london fashion week where we built a system with o2 i 'm only putting those up to show you these things are prosaic this stuff works in these environments 's psychic paper"
