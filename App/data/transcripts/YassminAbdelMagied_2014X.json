  "transcript": "someone who looks like me walks past you in the street do you think they 're a mother a refugee or a victim of oppression or do you think they 're a cardiologist a barrister or maybe your local politician do you look me up and down wondering how hot i must get or if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit what if i wore my scarf like this i can walk down the street in the exact same outfit and what the world expects of me and the way i 'm treated depends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth but this isn 't going to be another monologue about the hijab because lord knows muslim women are so much more than the piece of cloth they choose or not to wrap their head in this is about looking beyond your bias what if i walked past you and later on you 'd found out that actually what if i told you you that i was actually trained as a boxer for five years because that 's true too would it surprise you why and that results in the ridiculously detrimental lack of diversity in our workforce hello australian federal cabinet let me just set something out from the unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination i 'm not saying that in all of you there 's a secret sexist or racist or ageist lurking within waiting to get out we all have our biases they 're the filters through which we see the world around us it 's something that has to be identified acknowledged and mitigated against it can also be about class education the thing is if we want to live in a world where the circumstances of your birth do not dictate your future there 's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious so rather than no immediate change was registered until they asked the audition ers to take their shoes off before they entered the room now get this there results of the audition showed that there was a fifty percent increased chance a woman would progress past the preliminary stage and it almost tripled their chances of getting but there was the perception that they did and it was that bias that was determining their outcome let me give you an the father dies on impact the surgeon looks at the son when they arrive and is like i can 't operate why the boy is my son the surgeon is his mother now one of the interesting things around the space of unconscious bias is the topic of and this something that 's often brought up and of of the criticisms is this idea of merit it 's a sentiment that 's pretty common among female engineers that i work with and that i know and yeah i get it i 've been there but if the merit idea was true why would identical resumes in an experiment done in two thousand and twelve by yale identical resumes sent out for and be paid less there 's some research that talks about why this is the case and it 's called the merit paradox and in organizations and this is kind of ironic in so you guys think you 've got a good read on me you kinda think you know what 's up can you imagine me running and the cool thing about it is that it 's pretty entertaining actually in places like malaysia comment worthy there are that many of them but it is entertaining i remember i was telling one of the guys hey mate look i really want to learn how to surf and he 's like yassmin i don 't know how you can surf with all that gear you 've got on and i don 't know any why don 't you start a clothing line for muslim chicks in beaches you can call it youth without boardshorts and i was like thanks guys and i remember another bloke telling me that i should eat all the yogurt i could because that was the only culture i was going to get around there but the problem is it 's kind of true because there 's an intense lack of diversity in our workforce particularly in places of influence now in two thousand and ten the australian national university did an experiment where they sent out four thousand identical applications to entry level jobs essentially to get the same number of interviews as someone with an anglo saxon name if you were chinese you had to send out and if you 're italian you 're pretty lucky you only have to send out twelve percent more in google they put out some diversity results and thirty percent asian and nine a bunch of blacks hispanics all that kind of thing the rest of the tech world is not that much better and they 've acknowledged it but i 'm not really sure what they 're doing about it the thing is it doesn 't trickle up in a study done by green park who are a british senior exec supplier they said that over half of the ftse one hundred companies don 't have a nonwhite leader at their board level executive or non executive and two out of every three don 't have an executive who 's from and most of the minorities that are at that sort of level are non executive board directors so their influence isn 't that great i 've told you a bunch of terrible things you 're like oh my god how bad is that what can i do about it we 've identified that there 's a problem there 's a lack of opportunity but you might be sitting there thinking i ain 't brown what 's that got to do with me we live in a world where we 're looking for an ideal and if we want to create a world where the circumstances of your birth don 't matter we all have to be part of the solution and interestingly the author of the lab resume experiment offered some sort of a solution she said the one thing that so mentoring we 've all kind of heard that before it 's in the vernacular here 's another challenge for you i challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different everyone wants to mentor someone who kind of is familiar who looks like us we have shared experiences if i see a muslim chick who 's got a bit of attitude i 'm like what 's up we can hang out but for the person in the room who has no shared experiences with you it becomes extremely difficult to find that connection because ladies and gentlemen the world is not just i was born in one of the poorest cities in the world khartoum i was born brown i was born female and i was born muslim i also acknowledge the fact that i was born with privilege but also i 've been blessed with amazing mentors who 've opened doors for me that i didn 't even know were there let write something about it so that i can share it with people a mentor who said i know you 're all those things that don 't belong on an australian rig but come on anyway and here i am talking to you and i 'm not the only one there 's all sorts of people in my communities that i see have been helped out by mentors a young muslim man in sydney who ended up using his mentor 's help to start up bankstown and now it 's a huge thing and he 's able to change the lives of so many other young people or a lady here in she 's an inspiration and i 'm also the woman who was in the abaya at the beginning because i 'm that same person and i don 't have that level of patience then choose to open doors for people because you might think that go to the places you wouldn 't usually go if you enroll in private high school tutoring go to your local state but show them the opportunities because opening up your world will make you realize that you have access to doors that they didn 't even know existed and you didn 't even know they didn 't have there is a problem in our community with lack of opportunity and i encourage you to look past your initial perceptions because i bet you they 're probably wrong"
