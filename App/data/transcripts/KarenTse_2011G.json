  "transcript": "i walked into a prison in cambodia and i met a 12 year old boy and as i looked into his eyes i realized that for the hundreds of letters i had written for political prisoners 12 year old boy but of the one hundred and thirteen developing these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured and what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst percent of torture today is not for political prisoners it is for people and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation it 's cheaper than having a legal system cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel it is what happens most of the time i believe today that it is possible for us as a world community if we make a decision to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in the second so in the year two thousand i began to and i founded international bridges to justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the ninety three countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in did come from cambodia and at the time i remember first coming to cambodia and there were in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four still less than ten attorneys in the country because the khmer rouge had killed them all and even twenty years later there was only ten lawyers in the country so consequently you 'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12 year old boys you 'd meet women and you 'd say why are you here women would say well i 've been here for ten years because my husband committed a crime but they can 't find him place where there was no rule of law the first group of defenders came together and i still remember as i was training i said okay what do you do for an investigation and there was silence in the class and finally one woman stood up [ inaudible name ] and she said khrew which means teacher she said i have defended more than a hundred i 've never had to do any investigation because they all come with confessions and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other and i still remember the first cases where they and the judges kept saying no no no no we 're going to do things the exact same way we 've been doing them but one day the perfect case came and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller she was sitting outside of a house she said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was but the police came they got her there was nothing on her and when they brought her case to the judge for the first time he stood up and he said yes there 's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released and the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see they have step by step began to change the course of history in cambodia but it is in so many countries in burundi i walked into a prison and it wasn 't a diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison and when i walked up to the prison director i said you 've got to let her out eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer what can we do so lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can it was that [ inaudible name ] did not go alone but she had twenty four lawyers with her who stood up together and in the same way in china they always tell me it 's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said i 've been here for one year eight years twelve years without a lawyer he came and we had a training together and he said i have heard it said because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling i have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not and then he said but i want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice the key that we see though is training and what they told me is that they said hey we don 't have police on the streets now the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution they were torturing everybody all the time and i said but there 's been tens of millions of dollars and they were training prosecutors and judges which is the normal and they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual i said i 'm gonna copy this it had everything in it lawyers can come at the police station it was perfect prosecutors were perfectly trained which is by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor 's office what had happened to them and after a pause they said they had been tortured so the pieces are not only the training of the lawyers but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured and as i tell you this i 'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like oh okay it sounds like and there are many reasons why i believe it 's possible the first reason is the people on the ground so it 's an online contest where it 's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice and there are thirty justicemakers throughout the world from sri lanka to swaziland to the drc and it 's not so in china for instance great laws came out where it says police and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers how can we make sure that this is implemented this is fantastic and he said to me you have money and i said we can still figure it out he organized three thousand members of the youth communist league from fourteen of the top law schools and went to the police stations and began what legal revolution to protect citizen rights but the third and most important thing but it 's wildly idealistic never going to happen and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit but deep down you are not alone and i believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it we can end torture as an investigative tool but second of all i would leave you with the story of vishna who actually was my inspiration for starting international bridges to justice but because he was born in the prison and by the or if they were dark cells it was like iron corrugated and he would put his fingers through but he had a sense of his own heroic journey which i believe we are all born into he said probably but i 'm one i can do something and i will do the one thing that i can do so i thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together and invite you into this journey with us"
