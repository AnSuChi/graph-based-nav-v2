  "transcript": "muslim majority countries over the course of the last decade have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around have you ever looked at the arab uprisings and thought how could we have predicted that or how could we have better prepared for that well my personal story my personal journey what brings me to the ted stage here today muslim majority countries over the course of the last decades at least and beyond i want to share some of that story with you but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social so let me begin in medieval societies there were defined allegiances an identity was defined primarily nation state where identities and allegiances were defined so identity was primarily defined by ethnicity and the nation state reflected that in the age of globalization we moved on i call it the era of citizenship but all be equal as citizens in a state you could be american italian you could be and that age the new york times dubbed recently as the age of behavior how i define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives because it 's also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much up until the last six months the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational and that 's something which i 'd like to elaborate on if we look at islamists if we look at the phenomenon of far right fascists one thing they 've been very good at one thing that they 've actually been exceeding communicating across borders using technologies to organize themselves to propagate their message now i should know and the way in which it influenced and my story my personal story is truly evidence for the age of behavior that i 'm attempting to elaborate upon here i was by the way i 'm an essex lad born and raised in essex in the u k anyone who 's from england knows the but having been born in essex at age of sixteen i joined an organization at the age of seventeen i was recruiting people from cambridge university to this organization at the age of nineteen i was on the national leadership of this organization in the u k at the age of twenty one i was co founding this organization in pakistan at the age of twenty two i was co founding this organization in denmark by the age of twenty four i found myself convicted in prison in egypt being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments being subjected to torture in egyptian jails and sentenced to five years we felt that they were out of date i learned how to use email from the extremist organization that but the way in which i learned to use technology to my advantage was because i was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation state the age of where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior so as i said we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it and it 's not just islamist extremists that did this but even if you look across the mood music in europe of late far right fascism is also on the rise a form of anti islam and the consequences that this is having is that it 's affecting the political climate across europe individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another have become interconnected because the internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world in others kosher and halal meat are being banned as we speak and on the flip and so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream now that never would have been possible before they would have felt isolated well i believe they 're getting left far behind and i 'll give you an example here if any of you remembers the christmas day bomb plot there 's a man called anwar al awlaki in hiding currently in yemen who inspired a nigerian son of the head of nigeria 's national bank this nigerian was represented by his father the head of the nigerian bank the old mentality with a capital o as represented by the nation state and the christmas day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the united states of america in my and that 's the example that everyone here will be aware of and that 's the example of al qaeda if i ask you to think of their narratives the west being at war with islam the need to defend islam against the west these narratives the difference between ideas and narratives the idea is the cause that one believes in and the narrative is the way to sell that cause the propaganda if you like of the cause so these symbols and these leaders come to your mind if i ask your minds to focus currently on pakistan and i ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in pakistan be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of benazir bhutto which means by definition that particular leader no longer exists one of the problems we 're facing is in my view that there are no globalized grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across muslim majority societies there is no equivalent of the al qaeda without the terrorism for democracy across so that begs the next question why is it whereas those who aspire because those who aspire to democratic culture are in power and that level of complacency means they don 't feel the need to advocate for that culture the second i believe is political correctness that we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that yet actually whenever we talk about human rights we do say that human rights are universal out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with islamist extremism to go around saying that i believe democratic culture is the best that we 've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism and the third democratic choice in meaning political parties in many of these societies ask people to vote for them as the democratic party but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party wanting to rule by military and then you have a third party saying vote for us we 'll establish a theocracy so democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political and what happens as a result of this is when those parties are elected let 's bring the military back again and the fourth i believe is what i 've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance what i mean by that is if the world superpower today was a communist occupying so roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice not merely as a political when talking about those reasons let 's break down certain preconceptions is it just about grievances is it just about they are educated on average above the education levels of we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor well bin laden is from one of the richest families in saudi arabia his deputy ayman al zawahiri was a pediatrician not an ill educated man international aid and development has been going on for years but extremism in those societies in many of those societies has been on the rise and what i believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism and this is where i believe neoconservatism had it whereas for decades have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots they 've been building civilizational demand for their values on the grassroots and we 've been seeing those societies slowly transition to societies that are increasingly asking for a form of islamism mass movements in pakistan have been represented after the arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming rather than for a a democratic uprising because since pre partition they 've been building demand without human rights you don 't have the protection granted to you so what 's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself to create the demand on the ground for this culture what that will do where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy rather than merely on a political level a level above politics what we 'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy not for a democracy where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box to get to that well but what happened in the arab uprisings and what happened in egypt was particularly cathartic for me and that was to remove the leader because it 's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator but generally the trends that start in in the ' 80s and ' 90s when islamism started in the region it spread across the the mena region as a whole and the aspiration that we have at the moment as young arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that but that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions"
