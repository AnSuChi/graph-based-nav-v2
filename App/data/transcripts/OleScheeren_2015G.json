  "transcript": "for much of the past century architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine form follows function had become modernity 's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket as it liberated from the decorative but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose of course architecture is about function if form follows fiction we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories stories of the people that live there of the people that work in these buildings and we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create in this sense i 'm interested in fiction not as the implausible but as the real as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today our buildings are real they 're being built they 're an explicit engagement in physical reality and conceptual possibility i think of our architecture as organizational structures at their core is indeed structural thinking like a system how can we arrange things in both a functional and experiential way how can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives and how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture and here comes the second term into play what i call so we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships both in a programmatic and functional way and in an experiential and emotive or social way this is the headquarters for china 's national broadcaster which i designed together with rem koolhaas at oma when i first arrived in so we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about except one thing it would all be about verticality of course the skyscraper is vertical it 's a profoundly hierarchical structure the top always the best the bottom the worst and and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration rather than isolation so we took this needle and bent it back into itself into a loop of interconnected activities our idea was to bring all aspects of into one single structure news program production broadcasting research and training administration all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration i still very much like this image it reminds one of biology classes if you remember the human body with all organs and circulatory systems like at school and suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance but as an organism as a life form and as you start to dissect this organism you can identify a series of primary technical clusters canteens chat areas informal spaces for people to meet and exchange so the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social the human and the performative and of course we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity with four hundred and seventy three thousand square meters it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world so we stopped work is and we followed them throughout their day so it was a way to script and design the building but of course also to communicate its experiences this was part of an exhibition with the museum of modern art in both new york and beijing and this is how the building stands in beijing today its first broadcast live was the london olympics two thousand and twelve after it had been completed from the and you can see at the very tip of this 75 meter cantilever those three little circles and they 're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building they 're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion the building has become part of everyday life in beijing it is there it has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography but its its most important moment is is maybe sill this one that 's beijing is similar to time out a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the but actually as an urban actor as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city so architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player of something that writes stories and performs stories and i think that could be one of of its primary meanings that we believe in but of course there 's another story to this building it is the story of the people that made it four hundred engineers and architects that i was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in china this is a residential development in singapore large scale if we look it is dominated by the tower and i wanted to ask how could we think about living not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves and our apartment in an idea of a collective how could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own the typical answer to the question we had to design one thousand and forty apartments would have looked like this 24 story height limit given by the planning authorities twelve towers with nothing but residual in between a very tight system that although the tower isolates you it doesn 't even give you privacy because you 're so close to the next one that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be throw the vertical into the horizontal and stack them up and what looks a bit random from the side if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up and you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces they 're open permeable they 're interconnected we called the project the interlace thinking that we interlace and interconnect the human beings and the spaces alike and the quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants and in fact it was a system where we would layer so we would open up a spectrum between if we count all the green that we left on the ground we have one hundred and twelve percent green space so more nature than not having built a building and of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying the space available to those who live there this is in fact the 13th floor of one of these terraces so you see new datum planes new grounds planes for social we paid a lot of attention but most importantly we could prove that through the geometry of the building design we further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors so that evaporative cooling would create microclimates that again would enhance the quality of those spaces available this variety of choices of freedom within the own complexity of the complex in which you live transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media why would anyone today still want to go to the office because you can actually work anywhere and how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building we created not only an object but at the center of this object we created a giant space and this communication interaction as the center of a space that in itself so with only a few steps from your quiet work desk you could participate in the giant collective experience of the central space we come to london a project commissioned by the london legacy development corporation of the mayor of london prince thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind bringing arts and science closer we live in a world in which boundaries start to blur between the different domains and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important so we wanted to think of a giant culture machine a building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains but allow them to interact and collaborate it can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance occupy any of these modules so institutions could shrink or contract the future of culture is in a way the most uncertain of all and you can see how its project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside the idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume here 's a scale comparison to the centre pompidou in paris and it was this thought to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted for those in the educational parts that create and think and i want to end on a project that is very small in a way very different a floating cinema in the ocean of thailand friends of mine had founded if we think of we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them so i designed a small modular floating platform based on the techniques of local fishermen how they built their lobster and fish farms we collaborated with the local community and built out of recycled materials of their own this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films films from the british film archive [ one thousand nine hundred and three ] alice in wonderland for example"
