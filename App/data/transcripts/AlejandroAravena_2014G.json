  "transcript": "let 's start speed and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon has no precedence in history for you to have an idea out of the three billion people living in cities today one billion are under the line of poverty by two thousand and thirty out of the five billion people that will be living in cities two billion are going to be under the line of poverty that means that we will have to build a one city per week with ten thousand dollars per family during the next fifteen years a one million person city per week with ten thousand dollars per family if we don 't solve this equation it is not that people well an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves we were asked to accommodate one hundred families that had been occupying illegally half a hectare in the center of the city of iquique in the north of chile using a $ ten thousand subsidy with which we had to buy the land provide the infrastructure and build the houses that in the best of the cases would be of around forty square meters and by the way they said and we started a participatory design process and testing what was available only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height so the conclusion with the so what did we do well a middle class family but when there 's no money what the market does is to reduce the size of the house instead of thinking of forty square meters as a small house why don 't we consider it half of a good one when you rephrase the and we thought we had to do with public money the half that families won 't be able to do individually we identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half a house and we went back to the families to do two things join forces and split tasks our design was something in between a building and a house it could expand if in the process of not being expelled to the periphery while getting a house families kept their network and their jobs so we went from this initial social housing to a middle class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks different designs so the purpose of design trying to understand and trying to give an answer to the 3s menace scale speed and scarcity is to channel people 's own building the second case is how design can contribute to sustainability in two thousand and it is accepted that for such an aim knowledge creation interaction among people face to face contact it 's important and we agreed on that but for us the question of the right environment was a very literal question we wanted to have a working space with the right light with the right temperature with so we asked ourselves it 's a collection of floors one on top of each other with a core in the center with and then a glass skin on the outside maybe we have and what we did was let 's have an open atrium a so that when the sun 's not impacting directly glass but a wall you may also open those windows and get you don 't require sophisticated programming it 's not about technology this is just which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower to forty so with the right design sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common last case i would like to share is how design can provide more comprehensive answers against natural disasters and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the constitucin in the southern part of the we were given one hundred days street grid transportation housing and mainly thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation this is exactly what 's being discussed in japan nowadays and if you have a disciplined population like the japanese this may work so this alternative was unrealistic and undesirable second alternative build a big wall heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves but japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless and we started a participatory design process i don 't know if you were able to read the subtitles but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not or we go even further in asking what else is bothering you what other problems do you have and you want us to take care of now that the city we have problems of flooding due to rain it 's poor and it 's scarce but the river cannot be accessed publicly because its shores are privately owned and our our approach was against geographical threats have geographical answers in between the city and the sea we have a forest but dissipates it by introducing friction a forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding and that may provide finally the alternative was validated politically and socially but there was still the problem of the cost and found out that were three ministries with three projects in the exact same place not knowing of the existence of the other projects the sum of them so design 's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities which is not money but coordination by doing so we were able to save four million dollars and that is why the forest is today under construction so be it the force of self construction and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement life itself design 's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life thank you so much"
