  "transcript": "and whether it 's the opening line from one hundred years of solitude or the fantastical stream of consciousness in autumn of the patriarch where the words rush by which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel now i was a comparative literature major in college but not so with mrquez who once praised his translator 's versions as being better than his own which is an astonishing compliment so when i heard that the translator i couldn 't wait to read it it 's called apropos of the italian adage that i lifted from his forward if this be treason but the reason that i mention it is that early on rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight act of communication is an act of translation now maybe that 's been obvious to all of you for a long time but for me ever since i can remember thinking consciously about such things communication has been my central passion i remember thinking that what i really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else so no ego problems it 's funny my wife daisy whose family is littered with schizophrenics and i mean littered with them i don 't need a husband who wants to be anyway as i plunged through my 20s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was it was that second part being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge i was gaining where the futility of my quest really set in interestingly when your opening line of communication is hey listen up because i 'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you it 's amazing how quickly you 'll discover both ice and the firing squad i finally got it new personal truth all my own that if i was going to i 'd better find a different way of going about it and that 's when i discovered comedy now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language if i had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum i 'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies there 's plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel what i want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives gained in translation that it 's about communication that doesn 't just produce greater understanding within the individual but leads to real change which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of big on speaking to people 's self interest because we 're all wired for that it 's part of our survival package and that 's why it 's become so important for us and that 's why we 're always listening at that level and also because that 's where in terms of our own self interest we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond now as to what i mean by the now if you think back on tina fey 's impersonations on saturday night live of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate sarah palin they were devastating fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit the candidate 's fundamental lack of seriousness cementing an impression that the majority of the american public still holds today they were lifted verbatim from palin 's own remarks here was a palin impersonator quoting palin word now that 's honesty and integrity and it 's also why fey 's performances left such a lasting impression on the other side of the political spectrum the first time that i heard rush limbaugh refer to presidential hopeful john edwards as the breck girl but it 's really hard to argue with that punchline the description perfectly captured edwards now the daily show with john stewart is by far the most it 's by far the most survey after survey from pew research to the annenberg center for public policy has found that daily show viewers are better informed about current events than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of stewart 's viewers the larger point remains that stewart 's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts not because his intent is to inform it 's not and the result is great comedy that 's also an information delivery system now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people 's walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection a great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick and just like that you 've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses this is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic all of religion politics sexuality we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows revealing a fresh and unexpected now let me give you an example from my act because from what i can tell the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military get married and start a family three things i 've tried to avoid my have at it you radical bastards the field is yours and that 's followed by these lines about gay adoption what is the problem with gay adoption why is this remotely controversial if you have a baby and you think that baby 's gay you should be allowed to put it up for adoption you have given birth to an abomination remove it from your household now by taking the biblical epithet abomination and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence a baby this joke short circuits the emotional wiring behind the debate are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose bill hicks and if you don 't know his work you should really google him where finally the other kid says to him huh well my dad can beat up your that 's an entire childhood in three words laughter not to mention what it reveals about the adult who 's speaking them and one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it 's inherently viral people can 't wait to pass along that new great joke even cable tv back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty when comedian richard pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident i was in los angeles the day after it happened and then i was in washington d c two days after that and i heard the exact same punchline on both coasts clearly it didn 't come out of a tonight show monologue and my guess here and i have no research on this is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it you 'd find out that comedy is the second oldest viral profession but it 's when you put all of these elements together now i have a close friend joel pett who 's the editorial cartoonist for the lexington i was visiting with joel which meant that if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon on the opening day of the conference it could get passed around at the highest level among actual decision makers so we started talking about climate change which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or wasn 't which to both of us seems somewhat intentionally off point because first of there 's this false premise now governor perry of my newly adopted state of texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops fated campaign proclaiming over and over that the science wasn 't complete at the same time that two hundred and fifty out of two hundred and fifty four counties in the state of texas were on fire and perry 's policy solution was to ask the people of texas to pray for rain personally i was praying for four more fires so we could finally complete the damn science but back in two thousand the question joel and i kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science you 've got to love that idea not for god not for country not for profit just as a basic metric for global shortly after the conference was over joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the epa in washington whose wall it now hangs on and not long after that he got another request for a copy from the head of the epa in california who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in sacramento last year and it didn 't stop there and earlier this year he got a request from the green party in australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resulted in the australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world is a lot of punch for fourteen words so my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny because you might just find the question that you 've been looking for thank you"
