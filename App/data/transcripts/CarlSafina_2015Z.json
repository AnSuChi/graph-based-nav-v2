  "transcript": "have you ever wondered what animals think and feel let 's start with a question does my dog really love me or does she just want a treat it 's easy to see that our dog really loves us easy to see right what 's going on in that fuzzy little head what is going on something 's going on but why is the question always do they love us why is it always about us why are we such i found a different question to ask animals who are you there are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind but is that true what are other beings doing we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do the first thing to remember is our brain is inherited the first neurons came from jellyfish but it 's still true that a neuron a nerve cell looks the same in a crayfish a bird or you what does that say about the minds of crayfish can we tell anything about that well it turns out that if you give the crayfish the same drug it relaxes and comes out and explores how do we show mostly we boil them octopuses use tools as well as do most apes and they recognize human faces how do we celebrate the ape like intelligence of this invertebrate if a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping and it will signal to the moray follow me and the moray will understand that signal the moray may go into the crevice and get the fish but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get this is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about mostly fried a pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them sea otters use tools and they take time away from what they 're doing to show their babies what to do which is called teaching when evolution makes something new it uses the parts it has in stock at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain it 's a good thing ours is bigger because we 're also really insecure laughter but uh oh there 's a dolphin a bigger brain with more convolutions we see brains but what does that have to say about minds well we can see the working of the mind in the logic of behaviors so we make perfect sense they became who they are and we became who we are we 've been neighbors for a very long time no one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed they 're obviously very concerned about something what are they concerned about it turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes but if you record the voices of herders who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker they have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them they know us better than we know them whether we 're outfitted for hiking the killer whale has the same skeleton as do we and then we ask some people say well there are certain things that make humans humans and one of those things is empathy empathy is the ability to match moods with your companions it does not work very empathy is old but empathy like everything else in life comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration so there 's basic empathy you feel sad it makes me sad i see you happy it makes me happy then there 's something that i call sympathy i call that compassion far from being the thing that makes us human human empathy is far from perfect we round up empathic creatures but we don 't treat our own kind too well either people who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions to other species because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species they have the same structures the same hormones that create mood and motivation in us not scientific to say that they are hungry when they 're hunting and they 're tired when their tongues are hanging out and then say when they 're playing with their children and acting joyful and happy we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything that is not scientific when my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me not to the couch to me and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly i know that i can go over to carl he will understand i know i can trust him because we 're family he 'll get the job done and it will feel good she has thought and she has felt and it 's really not more complicated than that but we see other animals and we say oh look killer they know where they are all the time this is an elephant named philo he was a young male this is him four days later we create an awful lot of it we want to carve we wait for them to die elephants once ranged from the shores of the mediterranean sea all the way down to the cape of good hope and now their range is shattered into little shards this is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction a fellow being the most magnificent creature on land we killed every single wolf south of the canadian border actually but in the park park rangers did that in the and then sixty years later they had to bring them back because the elk numbers had gotten out of control the most accessibly visible wolves in the world and i watched the most famous most stable pack in yellowstone national park and then when they wandered just outside the border which we sometimes call the alpha female the rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry they wouldn 't let her because they were jealous of she was getting too much attention from two new males and she was the precocious one that was too much for them she wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot the alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family as winter was coming in he lost his territory his hunting support the members of his family and his mate we cause the mystery is why don 't they hurt us more than they do this whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale those people in the boat had nothing at all why can we trust them around our toddlers why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers ' home was right there on the shoreline and that 's happened more than one time in the bahamas there 's a woman named denise herzing and she studies spotted dolphins and they know her she knows them very well she knows who they all are they know her they recognize the research boat when she shows up and that was really strange how could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had would they care and why would it spook them these mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on earth that we almost never think about at all at an aquarium in south africa was a little baby dolphin named dolly and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool smoking dolly came over and looked at him nursed for a minute or two came back to the window and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like dolphin got the idea of using milk to represent smoke when human beings use one thing to represent another we call that art the things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human what makes us human is that of all these things that our minds and their minds have we are the most extreme we are the most compassionate most violent most creative but love is not the thing that makes us human it 's not special to us we are not the only ones who care about our mates we are not the only ones who care about our children albatrosses frequently fly six sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one meal one big meal to their chick who is waiting for they nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world and this is what it looks like this is an albatross six months old ready to fledge died packed with red cigarette lighters but we who have named ourselves after our brains never think about the consequences when we welcome new human life into the world we welcome we paint animals to show them that we are not alone we have company and every one of those animals in every painting of noah 's ark deemed worthy of salvation is in so we started with a question do they love us we 're going to ask another question are we capable of using what we have to care enough to simply let them continue thank you very much"
