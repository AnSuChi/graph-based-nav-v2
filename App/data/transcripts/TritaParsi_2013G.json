  "transcript": "and we do not intend to change our position in relation to tehran believe it or not this is a quote from an israeli prime minister but it 's the year is ayatollah khomeini is still alive and much like ahmadinejad today he 's using the worst rhetoric against israel yet rabin referred to iran as a geostrategic friend today when we hear the threats of war and the nothing and i hope today to show you why that is starting in when king cyrus the great of persia liberated the jewish people from their babylonian captivity a third of the jewish population stayed in babylonia they 're today 's iraqi jews a third migrated to persia they 're today 's iranian jews still twenty five thousand of them living in iran making them the largest jewish community in the middle east outside incidentally relations have been close at times rabin 's statement was a reflection of decades of security and intelligence collaboration between the two which in turn was born out of perception of common threats both states feared the soviet union and strong arab states such as egypt and iraq the israeli doctrine of the periphery the idea that israel 's security was best achieved by creating alliances with the non arab states in the periphery of the region in order to balance the arab states in its vicinity now from the shah 's perspective though he wanted to keep this as secret as possible so when yitzhak rabin for instance traveled to iran in the ' 70s he usually wore a wig the iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in tehran far so that no one would notice the large number of israeli planes shuttling between tel aviv and tehran now did all of this end with the islamic revolution in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine in spite of the very clear anti israeli ideology of the new regime the geopolitical logic for their collaboration lived on and when iraq invaded iran in eighty israel feared an iraqi victory and actively helped iran by selling it arms and providing it with spare parts for iran 's american weaponry at a moment when iran was very vulnerable because of an american arms embargo that israel was more than happy to violate in it was israel that lobbied washington to talk to iran to sell arms to iran and not pay attention and this of course climaxed in the iran contra scandal of the 1980s but with the end of the cold war came also the end of the two common threats that had pushed them closer together throughout decades more or less evaporated without iraq balancing iran iran could now become a threat some in israel argued the current dynamic that you see between iran and israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the cold war than in the events of one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners they increasingly came to view each other as rivals 1980s lobbied for and improved u s iran relations and instead sought to ironically this was happening at a time when iran was more interested in peacemaking with washington than to see to israel 's destruction iran had put itself in isolation because of its radicalism and after having helped the united states indirectly in the war against iraq in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one the iranians were hoping that they would be rewarded by being included architecture of the region but washington chose to ignore and it is at this point and the only way iran could compel washington to change its position was by imposing a cost on the u s if it didn 't the easiest target was the peace process and now the iranian ideological bark was to be accompanied by a nonconventional and iran began supporting extensively palestinian islamist groups that it previously had shunned but according to martin indyk the iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong because the more peace there would be between israel and palestine the more peace there would be the iranians had an interest to do us in on the peace process in order to defeat our policy of containment to defeat our policy of containment not about ideology netanyahu when he got elected in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six reached out to the iranians to see if there were any ways that the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected tehran was not interested a the iranians sent a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the bush administration a proposal that revealed that there was some potential of getting iran and israel back on terms again all sides have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity but this is not an ancient conflict the ebbs and flows of hostility have not shifted but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape when iran and israel 's security imperatives dictated collaboration they did so in spite of lethal ideological opposition to this is good news because it means that neither war nor enmity is a foregone conclusion but some want war and ahmadinejad is hitler if we accept this to be true that indeed it is one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight iran is germany ahmadinejad is hitler then the question we have to ask ourself is who wishes to play the role of neville chamberlain who will risk peace this is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at and when you eliminate diplomacy you make war inevitable but rather than making war inevitable by viewing this as ideological we would be wise to seek ways to make only a few decades old in a history of two thousand five hundred years however difficult it yet may be after all it was make peace with your friends you make it with your enemies"
