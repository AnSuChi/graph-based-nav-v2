  "transcript": "the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that 's actually one of the oldest questions in economics dating back to at least before adam smith and that is why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display different savings behavior now many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question and as a field we 've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this what i 'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that i 've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself let me tell you a little bit about savings rates a little bit about language and then i 'll draw that connection let 's start by thinking about the member countries of the oecd or the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd countries despite all of these similarities we see huge differences in savings behavior so all the way over on the left of this graph what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter and what you can see is that over the last twenty five years greece has barely managed to save more than ten percent of their gdp it should be noted of course that now that we see these huge differences in savings rates how is it and then i 'll draw the connection between these two behaviors many of you have probably already noticed that i 'm chinese i grew up in the midwest of the united states and something i realized quite early on was that the chinese language forced me to speak about and in fact suppose i were i were talking with you and i was introducing you to my uncle i wouldn 't have been able to convey so little information what my language would have forced me to do instead of just telling you this is my uncle is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information my language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother 's side or my father 's side whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth and if this man was my father 's brother whether he was older than or younger than my father all of this information is obligatory now but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time if i 'm speaking in english i have to speak grammatically differently if i 'm talking about because i have to consider that and i have to modify what i 'm saying to say it will rain or it 's going to rain it 's simply not permissible in english to say it rain tomorrow you would say in chinese a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speaker 's ears they can say yesterday it rain now it rain tomorrow it rain in some deep sense chinese doesn 't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that english forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly is this difference in languages only between very very distantly related languages like english and chinese actually no so many of you know in this room that english is a germanic language most other germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying morgen regnet es quite literally to an english ear it rain tomorrow affect your propensity to behave across time you speak english a futured language and what that means is that every time you discuss the future or any kind of a future event grammatically you 're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it 's something viscerally different now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak if that subtly nudges you to feel about now this is a fanciful theory i 'm a professor i get paid to have fanciful theories and interestingly enough there are pockets pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be by and large some of the world 's best savers just to give you a hint of that let 's look back at that oecd graph that we were talking about what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak futured languages now while these findings are suggestive countries can be different in so many different ways that it 's very very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences which is trying to gather hoping to get this relationship to break let me show you how far you can do that there is the survey of health [ aging ] and retirement in europe from this dataset you actually learn that retired european families are extremely patient with survey takers so imagine that you 're a retired household in belgium and someone comes to your front door excuse me would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio do you happen to know how much your house is worth do you mind telling me would you happen to have a hallway that 's more than ten meters long if you do would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway would you mind squeezing as hard as you can in your dominant hand this device so i can measure your grip strength how about blowing into this tube so i can measure your lung capacity the survey takes over a day laughter combine that with a demographic and health survey collected by usaid in developing countries in africa combine that with a world value survey which measures the political opinions and fortunately for me the savings behaviors of combine it and this map is what you get what you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both and what i 'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure and then i 'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels what are the characteristics we can control for well i 'm going to match families on country of birth and residence the demographics what sex their age their income level within their own country their educational achievement a lot about their family structure and most granularly i break them down by religion where there are seventy two categories of religions in the world so an extreme level of granularity there are one point four billion different ways that a family can find itself effectively everything i 'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families it 's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels one of whom speaks hausa and one of whom speaks igbo even after all of this granular level of control holding constant their income are going to retire with twenty five percent more in savings can we push this data even further well if savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure smoking is just the current pleasure in exchange for future pain what we should expect then is the opposite effect and that 's exactly what we find futureless language speakers are twenty to twenty four percent less likely to be smoking at any given point and they 're going to report being twenty one percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn 't present my linguistics and economics colleagues at yale and i are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future thank you very much"
