  "transcript": "the largest squatter community in this is the squatter community in sanjay gandhi national park which is one of the largest squatter communities in istanbul they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow the new urban world now why do i and i met julius and i was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and julius was tagging along and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around he grabbed my they 're very polite and and i found out later that it was julius ' first day and he 's one of many close to two hundred thousand people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas close to seventy million people and if you do the math between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities and here are the statistics today a billion squatters one in six people on the planet two thousand and the estimate is that in two thousand and fifty there 'll be three billion squatters better than one in three people on earth so and and i was thinking this morning of and before i show you the rest of my presentation i 'm going to violate ted rules here and i 'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as i can think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is so the hut was made of corrugated metal set on a concrete pad it was a ten by ten cell armstrong o shared it with three other men armstrong and his friends had no water they bought it from a nearby tap owner no toilet the families in this compound shared a single pit latrine and no sewers or sanitation but it could 've been anywhere in the city because more than half the city of nairobi lives like this one point five million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services no toilets no rights armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation they paid one thousand five hundred shillings in rent about twenty bucks a month a relatively high price for a and they could not afford to be late with the money ' one day ' the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country cut into the conversation meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a and we perspired as we ate after we finished armstrong straightened and we headed out into the glare outside a mound of garbage formed the border between southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of langata it was perhaps eight feet tall forty feet long they couldn 't have been more than five or six years old they were barefoot and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile and defecated but it stood in jarring contrast to something armstrong had said as we were eating that he treasured the quality of life in instead the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could freedom ' but nobody is restricting you nobody is controlling what you do once you have you cannot go back ' he meant back beyond that mountain of trash back in the legal city of legal buildings with legal leases and legal rights ' once you have stayed here ' he said ' you can stay for the rest of your life ' so he has hope this is little more than a stick and mud hut next to a garbage heap this is and it 's terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs and and it 's getting even better and then you get rocinha and you can see that it 's getting they develop and and then that person sells the roof rights and someone else builds on top of their building and then you get sultanbelyi in turkey the crud in the front is mattress stuffing and you see that all over turkey people dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs and it 's built to a pretty high standard of this is the main drag of rocinha the estrada da gavea and there 's a bus route that runs through it lots of people out on the street these communities in these cities are actually more vital this is a typical pathway in a beco these are how you get around the community it 's on very steep ground they 're built on the hills inland from the beaches and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions so that 's just a rock in the hillside and beer is all carried in right along the train tracks this is a marketplace also in kenya toi market lots of dealers in almost everything you want to buy this is a shopping street in kibera and you can see that there 's a soda dealer a health clinic two beauty salons a bar two grocery stores and a church and more it 's a typical downtown street it just happens to be self built this here on the right hand side is what 's called a if you look at the fine print under the awning it 's a hotel and what hotel means in kenya and india is an eating place so that 's a restaurant people steal electrical power this is rio people tap in and they have thieves who are called grillos or crickets and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood people burn trash to get rid of the garbage and they dig their own sewer channels and sometimes they have natural trash disposal and when they have more money they cement their streets and they put in sewers and good water pipes and stuff like that this is water going to rio people run their water pipes all they install a pump and they tap into the water main and pump water up to their houses so the question is how do you go from the mud hut village i say there are two things one is people need a guarantee they won 't be evicted does not necessarily mean property rights and i would disagree with hernando de soto on that question because property rights create a lot of complications they 're most often sold to people and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt there 's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don 't work in these cases but they do need security of tenure and they need access but it can also mean and i say that because the system in turkey is one is that it 's called gecekondu in turkish which means built overnight and if you build your house overnight you can 't be evicted without due process of law if they don 't catch you during the night and the second aspect is that once you have two thousand people in the community you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub municipality she lives in one of those tents on the highway median in mumbai that 's sureka gundi she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median they 're very outspoken they 're very active they can be community leaders this woman is and there were three old ladies who lived house behind her and they 've lived there for thirty or forty years and they are the backbone of the community there he makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood and the people in the neighborhood and is a great resource in the community and finally my choice to run for mayor of rio i don 't know the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people so i think the issue is not urban poverty the issue is not the larger over arching thing the issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods this is a legitimate form of urban development and that cities have to engage"
