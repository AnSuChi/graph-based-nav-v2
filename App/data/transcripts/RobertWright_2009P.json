  "transcript": "compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective i 'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule and so it 's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk i want to warn you about that and i think it 's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths at the same time i think religions don 't deserve all the credit i think nature gave them a helping hand here i 'm going to going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are in a certain sense built into human nature but i 'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature you realize that there was compassion and i mean not just when human human beings first showed up but actually even before that i think it 's probably the case that in the human evolutionary lineage even before there were homo sapiens feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had had earned their way into the gene pool and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened then in the end the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself so from a biologist 's point of view compassion is actually a gene 's way i 'll get there i hope to get a little fuzzier this doesn 't bother me so much that the underlying darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self serving at the genetic level actually i think the bad news about kin selection that 's the bad news the good news is the bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family now there 's more good news that came along later in evolution a second kind of evolutionary logic biologists call that reciprocal altruism ok and there the basic idea is that compassion compassion leads you to do i know this is this is not not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you you may have heard in the past but from a biologist 's point of view this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies i 'm sure a lot of you you feel really bad human so there 's still work to be done now i don 't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes but you can go to a to a hunter gatherer and you 'll find if you spend time with these people that basically they believe that one good turn deserves another and that bad deeds should be punished and evolutionary if you 've been paying attention you 're probably anticipating that there 's bad news here we still aren 't to universal love and it right so we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated now we have a rationale for that we say they did these bad things none of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion we have the capacity to carve out exceptions put people in a special category and the problem is that although in the case of sending people to prison you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule that in everyday the way we all make these decisions about who we 're not going to extend the golden rule to is we use a much if you 're my enemy if you 're my rival if you 're not my friend if you 're not in my family and you see it all over the world you see it in the middle east people who from gaza are firing missiles at israel they wouldn 't want to have missiles fired at them but they say well but the israelis or some of them have done things that put them in a special the palestinians or some of them have brought this on themselves so it 's natural to do that so the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not by itself going to bring us universal okay are you on the edges of your seats here good because before i tell you about that good news i 'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain so i hope i 've got your attention with this promise of good news that it 's this non zero sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about it 's just a quick introduction to game theory this won 't hurt okay it 's about the technical answer so in tennis is either good for you and bad for the other person or good for them bad for you either way your fortunes add up to zero then the person on your side of the net is in a relationship with you because every point is either good for both of you positive win win or bad for both of you it 's lose lose that 's a in real life there are lots of non zero sum games in the realm of economics say if you buy something that means you 'd rather have the merchandise than the money but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise you both feel you 've won in a war two allies are playing a the golden rule is deployed by just saying kind of webs of are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic okay so now you 're ready for the good news that i i said might save the world and now that i 've held your attention for three minutes of but it may and the good news is that you can go back all the way to the stone age technological evolution writing a lot of transportation and communication technologies has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non zero sum relationships with more and more people that 's the story of civilization it 's why social organization has grown from the hunter gatherer village to the ancient state the empire and now here we are in a globalized world and the story of of globalization is largely a story of you 've probably heard the term interdependence applied to the modern you see this all the time in the modern world you saw it with the recent economic crash where bad things happen in the economy bad for everybody for much of the world good things happen and it 's good for for much of the world and you know i 'm happy to say i think there 's really evidence kind of connection can expand the moral compass i mean if you look at the american attitudes toward japanese during world war ii look at the depictions of japanese in the american media as just about subhuman and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs really without giving it much of a thought and you compare that to the attitude now i think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence any form of interdependence forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people so i think that 's good and the world is full of and there are relationships that that maybe people aren 't aware of for example probably a lot of american christians don 't think of themselves as being in a with with muslims halfway around the world but they really are because if if these muslims become happier and happier with their with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it that 's good for americans because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten american security so there 's sometimes people don 't i think politicians can play a role this isn 't only about religion i think politicians can help foster relationships economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on in this regard and politicians can be aware and should be aware that when people around the world are looking at them are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a because you know historically if you 're not being respected you 're probably not going to wind up in a mutually profitable relationship with people so we need to be aware of what kind of signals we 're sending out and some of this again is in in the realm of political work if there 's one thing i can encourage everyone to do politicians religious leaders and us it would be what what i call expanding the moral imagination that is to say your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances this is is not the same as compassion but it 's conducive to compassion it opens the channels for compassion and i 'm afraid we have another good news bad news story which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature that 's good but again we tend to deploy it selectively once we define somebody as an enemy we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes just naturally so if you want to take a particularly hard case for an american somebody in iran who is burning an american flag and you see them on tv well the average american is going to going to resist the the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person 's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person and if you tell them well they think america disrespects them and even wants to dominate them and they hate america has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly you know they 'll resist that comparison and that 's natural it 's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it doesn 't naturally go i think it 's worth the trouble because and i think it 's good good moral exercise i would say here is where religious leaders come in because religious leaders are are good at reframing issues for people at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and i mean religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business it 's their great calling right now to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations appreciating that in so many ways they 're in the same boat that compassion and the golden rule are in"
