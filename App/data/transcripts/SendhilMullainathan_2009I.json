  "transcript": "as a researcher every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting and this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you and teaches you that you 're very wrong about something because you go to sleep that night dumber than when you woke up so that 's really the goal of my talk is to a communicate that moment to you this incident that i 'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea now we 've known for a long time the of diarrhea that 's why there 's a glass of water up there it 's deadly they lack nutrients and diarrhea dehydrates them and so as a result there is a lot of death a lot of death in india in one thousand nine hundred and sixty there was a twenty four percent child mortality rate lots of people didn 't now and there was actually a big solution this solution has been called by some potentially the most important medical the solution turned out to be simple and what it was was it 's a way to get sodium remarkable impact on mortality but a big drop it looks like the technological problem is solved but if you look even today there are about four hundred thousand diarrhea related deaths in india alone what 's going on here well the easy answer is we just haven 't gotten those salts to those people that 's actually not true if you look in areas where these salts are completely the price is low or zero these deaths still continue abated maybe there 's a biological answer maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration alone doesn 't solve that 's not true either many of these deaths were completely preventable see we spent a lot of energy in many domains that 's been the discoveries of the last two thousand years that 's mankind moving forward that 's for oral rehydration maybe this is something unique about diarrhea well it turns out and this is where things get really disconcerting it 's not unique to diarrhea it 's not even unique to poor people in india here 's an example from a variety of contexts i 've put a bunch of examples up here i 'll start with insulin diabetes u s ok the american population on medicaid if you 're fairly poor you get medicaid or if you have health insurance insulin is pretty how many people are taking their insulin every day hundreds of thousands lose limbs every year for something here i have a bunch of other examples all suffer from the last mile problem it 's not just medicine so we create new new ways of farming that increase income well look at some old ways some ways that we 'd already cracked intercropping really increases income sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield when you mix different varieties of rice side by side some people are doing that many are not what 's going on this is the last mile the last mile is everywhere problematic the problem is this little three pound machine that 's behind your eyes and between your ears and one of the consequences is that people are weird they do lots of inconsistent things and the inconsistencies create see when we were dealing with our biology bacteria the genes the things inside here the blood but it 's manageable when we 're dealing with should you increase maintain or decrease the number of fluids just so you don 't embarrass yourselves i 'll give you the right answer it 's increase now diarrhea 's interesting because it 's been around for thousands of years ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water one roman strategy that was very interesting was that and it really gave them a comparative advantage they made sure their soldiers didn 't drink even remotely muddied waters because if some of your troops get diarrhea they 're not that effective on the battlefield so if you think of roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields the breastplates but part of it was drinking the right water here are these women they 've seen their parents have struggled with diarrhea they 've struggled with diarrhea they 've seen lots of deaths how do they answer this question in india thirty five to fifty percent say reduce thirty five to fifty percent of women they are increasing they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions how is that possible well one possibility i think that 's how most people respond to this is to say that 's just stupid so think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake just doesn 't make sense now and that to me is the fundamental challenge of this first challenge is what i refer to as the persuasion challenge to do something take oral rehydration therapy intercrop whatever it might be is not an act of information let 's give them the data and when they have data they 'll do the right thing it 's more complex than that and if you want to understand how it 's more complex let me start with something and i want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible a bat and so somebody out there says five a lot of you said ten let 's think about ten for a second this is easy $ one point one yeah together they would cost $ one point two so here you all are ostensibly educated people most of you look smart of that produces so let 's let 's go back to kindergarten let 's let 's see if we can beat five year olds here 's what i 'm going to do i 'm going to put objects on the screen that 's all it is ok i want you to do it fast black now the next ones i want you to do quickly and say it out loud ready that 's pretty good almost out of kindergarten you see what 's going on here and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world some models that you use to understand the world these models like the leaky bucket work well in most situations i suspect a specific problem that actually same thing here you had an intuitive response to this that was very quick you read blue and you wanted to say blue even though you knew your task was red but it 's more profound than fun i 'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion bmw how am i going to advertise safety i could give people numbers we do well on crash tests but the truth of the matter is you look at that car it doesn 't look like a volvo and it doesn 't look like a hummer so what i want you to think while you 're thinking about that let 's move to a second task the second task is fuel efficiency okay here 's another puzzle for all of you one person walks into a car lot and they 're thinking about buying this toyota yaris they are saying this is thirty five miles per gallon i 'm going to do the environmentally right 'm going to buy the prius fifty miles per gallon and they say you know what do i need turbo do i need this heavyweight car i 'm going to do something good for the environment i 'm going to take off some of that weight and i 'm going to buy a hummer that 's eleven miles per gallon which one of these people has done more for the environment see you have a mental model that 's a big move eleven versus nine come on turns out go home and do the math the nine to eleven is a bigger change that person has saved more gallons why because we don 't care about miles per gallon we care about gallons per mile think about how powerful that is if you 're trying to encourage fuel efficiency miles per gallon is the way we present things if we want to encourage change of behavior gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness researchers have found these type back to bmw what should they do the problem bmw faces is this car looks safe this car which is my mini doesn 't look that safe and therefore doesn 't get into an accident bwm it harnesses something you already believe now even if i persuaded you to do something it 's hard sometimes to actually you all probably intended to wake up i don 't and makes us realize intentions don 't always translate into action and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that ok so and i think maybe i 'm being too you gotta carry you may think to yourself well if my eyes depended on it and they do here is an innovation a design innovation you just gotta carry this thing anywhere between five and ten percent increase in adherence just as a result of this but the human innovation the human problem still remains and that 's a this isn 't about the biology of people this is now about the brains the psychology of people and innovation needs to here 's your neighbor 's energy use you 're doing well smiley face this isn 't a new technology this is a letter i think this tells us there is an opportunity and i think to tackle it we need to combine psychology marketing art we 've seen that but you know what we need to combine it with we need to go ahead and use it we have testing we go to the lab we try it again we have refinement but you know what we do on the last mile idea people will like this let 's put it out there the amount of resources we put in are disparate we put billions of dollars into fuel efficient technologies how much are we putting into energy behavior change it 's a social science that recognizes much like science recognizes the complexity of the body biology recognizes the complexity of the body we 'll recognize the complexity of the human mind the careful testing retesting design are going to open up vistas of understanding complexities difficult things and those vistas will both create new science and fundamental change in the world as we see it in the next hundred years all right thank you very much it sometimes feels listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of how much is your field talking to great marketers about their insights into human psychology because they 've seen there are insights to be gleaned there forty percent of it is about what marketing is marketing is selling an ad to a firm that 's different from actually having an effective ad campaign and one of the new movements in marketing is how do we actually measure effectiveness are we effective ca how you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into and then we say well you get this behavior change let 's come up with a few ideas test them see which is working go back synthesize and try to come up with a thing that works and then we 're able to scale with partners it 's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts if you have biological problems we try and fix it see if it works and then work the scale"
