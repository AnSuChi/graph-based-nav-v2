  "transcript": "i felt like i was invincible i probably should have gone to the doctor but i 'd never really been sick in my life i would walk straight into door i had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom which always came back normal but no one else can see know it sounds silly but you have to find a way to explain things like this to yourself and so i maybe this is what it 's like to be on the other side of twenty five then the neurological symptoms started sometimes i would find that i couldn 't draw the right side of a circle other times be able to speak or move at all i even saw a psychiatrist i hope they can find out what 's wrong with you the next day my neurologist diagnosed me with conversion disorder told me that everything the fevers the sore throats the sinus infection all of the gastrointestinal neurological and cardiac symptoms were being caused by some distant emotional trauma that i could not remember the symptoms were real he said but they had no biological cause i had studied but i knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive so i had to consider the possibility that he was right that day i ran a small experiment i walked back the two miles from my neurologist 's office to my house contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this as soon as i walked through the door i collapsed my brain and my spinal cord were burning my neck was so stiff i couldn 't touch my chin to my chest and the slightest sound the rustling of the sheets my husband walking barefoot in the next room i would spend most of the next two years in bed how could my doctor have gotten it so wrong something doctors had never seen and then i went online and found thousands of people all over the world some could still work but had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed just so they could show up the next the other end of the spectrum some were so sick unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one i was diagnosed with you 've probably heard it called chronic fatigue syndrome for decades that 's a that 's meant that this has been the dominant image of a disease that can be as serious as this mentally i might be bedridden for a week i know ballet dancers who can 't dance medical students who never became doctors it doesn 't matter what you once were you can 't do it anymore it 's estimated that about fifteen to thirty million people around the world have this disease in the us where i 'm from it 's about one million people that makes it roughly twice as common as multiple sclerosis patients can live for decades with the physical function of someone with congestive heart failure twenty five percent of us are homebound or bedridden and how could a disease this common and this devastating have been forgotten by medicine he was invoking a lineage of ideas about women 's bodies that are over two thousand five hundred years old the roman physician galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly passionate women pressing on internal organs yes causing symptoms from extreme emotions to dizziness and paralysis the cure was marriage and motherhood sigmund freud developed a theory that the unconscious mind could produce physical symptoms when dealing with memories or emotions too painful for the conscious mind to handle it converted these emotions into physical symptoms this meant that men could now get hysteria but of course women were still the most susceptible when i began investigating i was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run in one thousand nine hundred and thirty four one hundred and ninety eight doctors nurses and staff at the los angeles county general hospital became seriously ill they had muscle weakness stiffness in the neck and back fevers all of the same symptoms i had when i first got diagnosed post infectious disease they thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria why has this idea had such staying power they want to know the answer the problem is that this can cause real harm in the 1950s a psychiatrist named eliot slater studied a cohort nine years later twelve of them were dead and thirty had become disabled epilepsy brain tumors in one thousand nine hundred and eighty hysteria was officially renamed conversion disorder when my neurologist gave me that diagnosis in two thousand and the problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness and in the case of me psychological explanations have held back biological research all around the world me is one of the least funded diseases in the us we spend each year roughly two thousand five hundred dollars per aids patient two hundred and fifty dollars per ms patient the ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us us why you can get it after almost any infection from enteroviruses to epstein barr virus to q fever or why it affects women at two to three times the rate of men when i first got i soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s whose bodies were falling apart an autoimmune connective tissue disease who was told for years that it was all in her head her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged she will never be able to eat again another woman with ovarian cancer who for years was told that it was just early menopause since the rates of many autoimmune diseases have doubled to tripled of patients who are eventually diagnosed with a recognized autoimmune disease are initially told they 're hypochondriacs like the hysteria of old this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe and in some diseases it 's as high as ninety percent even though these diseases disproportionately affect women they are not women 's diseases me affects children and me affects millions of men as one patient told me we get it coming and going if you 're a woman you 're told you 're exaggerating your symptoms but if you 're a guy you 're told to be strong to buck up and men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed my brain is not what it used despite everything i still have so many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms patients with epilepsy could be forcibly institutionalized until the eeg was able to measure abnormal electrical activity in the brain and recently we used to think that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress until we discovered that h pylori was the culprit me has never benefited from the kind of science that other diseases have had but that 's starting to change in germany scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity and in japan of brain inflammation in the us scientists at stanford are finding abnormalities in energy metabolism that are researchers are running a phase 3 clinical trial on a cancer drug that in some patients causes complete remission what also gives me hope is the resilience of patients online we came and we shared our stories we became our own scientists and our own doctors because we had to be will i sit in the garden for fifteen minutes or will i wash i had a sick body that was all maybe one day i could get better but it is not enough i still don 't know if i will ever be able to run again but i am so grateful for how far i have come and it is up and it is but i am getting a little better each day but here i am today with you and that is a miracle as so many others have done how many lives could we save today if we decide to make a real start start even once the true cause of my disease is discovered living with this illness has taught me that science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors doctors scientists and policy makers are not immune to the same biases that affect all of us we need to think in more nuanced ways about women 's health and we need to be willing to say i don 't know i don 't know is a beautiful thing i don 't know is where discovery and if we can do that thank you"
