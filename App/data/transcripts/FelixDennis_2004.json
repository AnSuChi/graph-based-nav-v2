  "transcript": "you were the better at but who was the better man you were the better at but who was the better man you were the better i was the better at but who was the better man i was the better at coke and rum remember that night on the beach in ibiza the maori twins old chum who was the better man now we come down now that you 're leaving now that they 've sealed your arse and your ears what i 've been meaning to tell you for years wrote this next poem for my mother every one of us had a mother only one probably the most important person in your life if you 're lucky enough to know them let me try and describe platinum hair why do they do that why do old ladies go to those hair shops and make looks like a much prettier version of margaret thatcher but without any of the soft bits in margaret 's character but my mother has lived by this creed all her life never go back to the beaten never succumb to the gorgon 's stare to the beaten track never surrender the future you earned never return to the bridges you 've burned treat every day of your life as your last never go back never acknowledge up on me hobbyhorse if every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track ladies don 't do it you bodies are wonderful as they are just leave them alone to a beautiful lady of a certain age count thy sheep and not thy years nothing good can come of this time rules all my dearest ' tis but folly to be waging war on one who never lost before lady we have drunk the summer wine none can make a stitch in time nip and tuck till nor may time be bought do i love thee less do i shrink from thy caress think you i could cease to care never was there one lady lady do not weep count thy blessings not thy has done more for me financially than britain even when on its worst behavior i find myself automatically defending the usa from the sneers of green eyed europhiles playing their greek card to roman trumps america is an empire hope you know that now bureaucratic affairs as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy as they are corrupted by power in their dotage but it seems to be that the usa if more pervasive kind let me put this bluntly how come they rule the world hail to the gods of america which is america 's jupiter the brahmins of capital hill a sorcerer 's profit on wall street they eye whose servants enslave us all whose power and if you would like to know why i am not a father i who by a miracle have twenty two godchildren the answer is in this poem which upsets me every time i read it love came to visit me but finding me busy she fled with the dawn at twenty the torch of resentment was lit my rage at injustice waxed hot as the pits once novelty waned his terror unfeigned at thirty my powers seemed mighty to me the fruits of my rivals i shook from the tree by guile and by bluster and women grew willing to sham and to bluff their trinkets and baubles cost little enough from forty to fifty we feasted and reveled grown sick to our stomachs and sick of our lives love came to visit me she fled with the dawn um there are i 've got far too much money and i have far too much fun in my businesses so poetry came as a complete shock to me ladies and gentlemen a complete shock i was a little ill okay i was ill okay i wasn 't allowed to see any of my and i i didn 't know what else to do so i started to write poetry that was in october but sometimes i try to put myself in an evil man 's position i 'm not a glorious and but sometimes i try to put myself in that position i love to think what they thought what it was like because although many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience although you guys can not only go to the moon you know you 're going to totally transform everything cloning will transform everything voice navigation will transform everything my friends human nature is exactly the same as it was when my ancestor probably it was my ancestor got his hands around the neck of the last neanderthal and battered the bastard to death think we didn 't do that oh we did we killed every single one of them inch by inch rivals for berries we 're still doing it with all of the genius assembled in this room even when we 've got off this little and i am as bad as you i spent eight years and at seven o 'clock every night i took me some more already corrupted i never did anything to anyone that wasn 't and i took crack cocaine every single night for seven years it was like dante 's and you stay up for twelve it was absolutely unbelievable twenty two godchildren i 've got what do i say to them i only stopped if you 're a woman remember that the love of your son can utterly transform anything he does our lady in white pale she was listless and soft we breathed but to savor we craved but to favor the hem of her dress we dabbled and babbled denying our thirsts but always we scrabbled to lie with her we missed her grew haggard or threatened her pimp came word out of babel the lady returns and there on the table we she made us her slaves many there were to covet her kiss my shame as a spur i fled"
