  "transcript": "i fascinate with the human body and explore how i can transform it i started my own experiments these were the approaches to the high tech conversations i was having these are q tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue i started a collaboration with a friend of mine bart hess he doesn 't normally look like this and we used ourselves as models we transformed our apartments into our laboratories and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way we were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution whilst i was at philips we discussed this idea of a maybe technology something that wasn 't either switched on or off but in between a maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid i set up my studio in the red light district and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing and found a way to redefine the skin and create this dynamic textile and she talked about how technology with these new feathers this new face paint this punk the way that we identify with the world and we made this music video and would we revert and i created a swallowable perfume which is a cosmetic pill that you eat and the fragrance comes out through the skin 's surface when you perspire it completely blows apart the way that perfume is and provides a whole new format it 's perfume coming from the inside out i 've learned that there 's no boundaries and if i look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense but when i look towards the future the next project is completely unknown and wide open i feel like i have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me and it 's these conversations and these experiences and i feel like i 've just got started so here 's to another day at the office"
