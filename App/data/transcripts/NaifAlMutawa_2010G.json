  "transcript": "thousand and ten the justice league of america will be teaming up with the ninety nine icons like batman superman wonder woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies as fascism took over europe in the 1930s an unlikely reaction came out of north america as christian iconography got changed and swastikas were created out of crucifixes batman and superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada also going back to the bible consider this like the prophets all the superheroes are missing parents superman 's parents die on krypton bruce wayne who becomes batman loses his parents at the age of six in gotham city spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle and all of them just like the prophets who get their message from god through gabriel get their message from above peter parker is in a library in manhattan when the spider descends from above bruce wayne is in his bedroom and he sees it as an omen to become batman superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens krypton but he 's sent in a pod much like moses was on the nile and you hear the voice of his father jor el saying to earth i have sent to you my only son these are clearly biblical archetypes and the thinking behind that was to create positive the same things that other people were pulling mean messages out of because then the person that 's using religion for the wrong purpose just becomes a bad man with a bad message and it 's only by linking positive things that the negative can be delinked this is the kind of thinking that went into creating the ninety nine the ninety nine references the ninety nine attributes of allah in the koran things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about it doesn 't matter what your religion is even if you 're an atheist you don 't raise your kid telling him you know make sure you lie three times a day those are basic human values and so the backstory of the ninety nine takes place in one thousand two hundred and fifty eight which history tells us the mongols invaded baghdad and destroyed it all the books from bait al hikma library the most famous library in its day were thrown in the tigris river and the tigris changes color with ink it 's a story passed on generation after generation and in my version the librarians find out that this is going to happen and here 's a side note if you want a comic book to do well make the librarians the hero it always works well but the mongols get there first the books and the solution get some librarians escape and over the course of days and weeks they dip the stones into the tigris and suck up that collective wisdom that we all think is lost to civilization those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads of thirty three stones each through arabia into andalusia in spain where they 're safe for two hundred years but in the second is columbus finally gets funded to go to india but he gets lost so thirty three of the stones are smuggled onto the nina the pinta and the santa maria and are spread in the new world thirty three go on the silk road to china south asia and southeast asia and thirty three are spread between europe the middle east and africa and now it 's two thousand and ten and there are ninety nine heroes from ninety nine different countries now it 's very easy to assume that those books because they were from a library called he had told his advisers get me all the scholars to translate any book they can get their hands onto into arabic and i will pay them its weight in gold after a while his advisers complained they said your highness the scholars are cheating they 're writing in big handwriting to take more gold to which he said let them be because what they 're giving us is worth a lot more than what we 're paying them so the idea of an open architecture an open knowledge is not new to my neck of the desert number two all of the ninety nine when they first get their stone or their power abuse it they use it for self interest and there 's a very strong ninety nine stones all have within them a mechanism that self updates now there are two groups that exist within the muslim world i don 't belong there then there 's a group that believes the koran is living breathing document does not want these stones to update so he 's trying to get them to stop updating he can 't use the stones but he can stop them and by stopping them he has more of a fascist agenda where he gets some of the ninety nine to work for him they 're all wearing cookie cutter same color uniforms they 're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are and he controls them from the top down whereas they actually each one has a different colorful kind of dress and the last point about the ninety nine noor stones is this so the ninety nine work in teams of three why three a couple of reasons number one we have a thing within islam that you don 't leave a boy and a girl alone together because the third person is temptation or the devil but this is not about religion it 's not about proselytizing there 's this very strong social message that needs to get to kind of the deepest crevices of intolerance and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game and so this is the way i dealt with it they work in teams of three two boys and a girl two girls and a boy three boys three girls no problem and the swiss psychoanalyst carl jung also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures so i figure i i got accused in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the pope to preach the trinity and catholicism in the middle east so you you believe who you want i gave you my version of the story we have jabbar from saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power the ninety nine attributes of allah have the yin and the yang there 's the powerful the hegemonous the strong and there 's also the kind the generous i 'm like are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong i 'm like you know what i 've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime so we have jami from hungary who first starts making weapons he 's the technology wiz musawwira from ghana hadya from pakistan jaleel from iran who uses fire and this is one of my favorites al batina from yemen i came home to my wife and i said i created a character after you my wife is a saudi from yemeni roots and she said show me so i showed this she said that 's not me i said look at the eyes they 're your eyes so i promised my investors this this was going to be superman or it wasn 't worth my time or their money so from day one the people involved in the project bottom left is fabian nicieza writer for x men and power rangers next to him is dan panosian one of the character creators for the modern day x men top right is stuart moore a writer for iron man next to him is john mccrea who was an inker for spiderman and we entered western consciousness with a tagline next ramadan the world will back in two thousand and five and i found somebody from the new york times and i cornered him and i pitched him and i think i scared him we 'll give you a paragraph in the arts section if you 'll just go away i became timely so flurry of phone calls and emails from the new york times next thing you knew there 's a full page covering us positively january 22nd two thousand and six which changed our lives forever because anybody googling islam and cartoon or islam and comic guess what they got they got me ninety nine were like superheroes kind of flying out of what was happening around the world and that led to all kinds of things from being in curricula in universities and schools to one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab it looked like a school the good news is they 're all holding copies of the ninety nine smiling and they found me to sign the picture the bad news is they were all photocopies so we didn 't make a dime in revenue comic books into eight languages so far chinese indonesian hindi urdu turkish just amazing is that we 've done a 26 episode animated series which is done for global audiences in fact we 're already going to be in the u s and turkey we know written in hollywood by the writers behind ben ten and spiderman and star wars clone wars in this clip i 'm about to show you which has never been seen in the public before they don 't know ok and they 're trying to get another what 's happening dana there 's too much darkness rughal there must be something we can do man i won 't send any more commandos in until i know it 's safe it 's time to go miklos miklos must download file contents i can 't forget auntie jabbar dana i can 't do this without you dana but i can 't help jabbar you can even if you don 't believe in yourself right now i believe in tell me which way to go and you want to reboot the i worry because all around me even within my extended family i see religion being manipulated as a psychologist i worry for the world in general but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world and i heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership only to end up being tortured by their heroes and torture 's a terrible enough thing as it is but when it 's done by your hero that just breaks you in so many ways i left bellevue went to business school and started this now and i took away the name of the writer the name of the [ unclear ] everything was gone except the facts and the first one was about a group called the party of god who wanted to ban valentine 's day red was made illegal any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately and i asked the students in kuwait where they thought these incidents took place the second one they were actually split between saudi and afghanistan what blew their mind was the first one took place in india it was the party of a hindu god but what breaks my heart and what 's alarming refer to that behavior as talibanization they said it 's us and this is dangerous 's dangerous when a group self identifies itself as extreme this is one of my sons rayan who 's a scooby doo addict you can tell by the glasses there he actually called me a meddling kid the other day but i borrow a lesson that i learned from from him last summer when we were in our home in new york he was i 'm working i 'm busy and what rayan did then i have work to do applause rayan reframed the situation and brought himself down to my level you know i think that there 's a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas and when i see pictures like this of parents or uncles who think it 's cute to have a little child holding a koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something the hope is by linking enough positive things to the koran that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they 're proud there to that and i think i think the ninety nine can and will achieve its mission as an undergrad at tufts you know it was middle east day or something and people came up and picked up the culturally ate it and you know talked and left and no two people could disagree about what the word free was and what the word falafel was behind us free falafel you know or so we thought until a woman came rushing across the campus and dropped her bag on the floor pointed up to the sign and said who 's falafel she was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting just today d c comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover on that cover you see batman superman and a fully clothed wonder woman with our saudi member of the ninety nine our emirati member and our libyan member president barack obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous cairo speech in which he reached out to the muslim world the most innovative was that the ninety nine reach back out to the justice league of america we live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols like the falafel can be misunderstood because of baggage and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it 's not supposed to be by others in a"
