  "transcript": "i 'm going to take you on a journey that is probably the biggest dream of humanity to so for me everything started many many years ago when i met i was doing physics i was coming back home and i realized that i actually always knew a 3d printer and everyone does it was my mom laughter my mom takes a bit of information which is between my father and my mom in this case so apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a 3d printer i immediately got mesmerized by that piece the first one the information what amount of information does it i was studying physics at the beginning and i took this approximation of a human as a gigantic lego piece so imagine that the building blocks are little atoms and there is a hydrogen here so in the first approximation if i can list the number of atoms that compose a human being so the number of atoms the file that i will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby will actually fill an entire titanic of thumb drives multiplied two thousand times every time you see from now on a pregnant lady she 's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter forget big data forget anything you heard of this is the biggest amount of information that exists but nature fortunately is much smarter than a young but it took us more than forty years to finally poke inside a human cell take out this crystal unroll it and read it for the first time the code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet four letters a t c and g and to build a human you need three billion of them three billion so i was thinking how i could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is but but for the first time in shipped from the united states to canada thanks to bruno bowden i can so just to let you see what is the code of life thousands and thousands and but this sequence gives the color of the eyes to craig i 'll show you another part of the book this is actually because if you miss just two letters in this position two letters of our three billion he will be condemned to a terrible we don 't know how to solve it and it 's just two letters of difference from what we are every one of you what makes me me and you you is just about five million five hundred pages so now that i have your attention the next question is this instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life trying everything we can and learning everything we can learn from these books with one target understanding what things should be done to have better health and what are the secrets in these books an amazing team forty data scientists and many many more people a pleasure the concept is actually very simple we 're going to use a technology called machine learning we have genomes thousands of them we collected the biggest database of human beings phenotypes 3d scan everything you can think of inside there on these two opposite sides there is the secret of translation and in we build a machine and we train a machine well not exactly one machine many many machines to try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype and what do they do it 's an approach that can be used for everything but using it in genomics is particularly complicated little by little we grew and we wanted to build so we started to ask our questions can we predict height eight kilograms of precision can we predict eye we can and we make a model now an interesting challenge can we predict a human face it and if you 're comfortable with machine learning you understand what the challenge is here now after fifteen years fifteen years after we read the first sequence this october we started to see some signals and it was a very emotional moment what you see here so we take the real face of a subject we reduce the complexity because not everything is in your face lots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life this is the prediction we have from the wait a second so i ask which are many lets you understand that we are in the right ballpark this is another subject that comes in place and this is a and this is the prediction so these people have never been seen in the training of the machine these are but since we are onstage so in this vial of blood and believe me you have no idea what we had to do to have this blood now here is the amount of biological information that we need to do a full we ran this sequence and i 'm going to do it with you we predict that he 's a meter and seventy six cm the subject is a meter and we are almost there that 's his face the subject is this person and i did it intentionally i am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity southern european italians they never fit in models but there is another point so one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people will never be written in the genome it 's our free will it 's how i look not my haircut in this case but my beard cut so i 'm going to show you i 'm going to in this case transfer it and this is nothing more than photoshop no modeling the beard on the subject why do we do this we certainly don 't do it for predicting height or taking a beautiful picture out of your we do it because the same technology and the same approach the machine learning of this code is helping us to understand how we work how your body works how your body ages how disease is a challenge that we share with thousands of other researchers around the world it 's called personalized medicine it 's the ability to move from a statistical approach where you 're a dot in the ocean to a personalized approach where we read all these books and we get an understanding of exactly how you are but it is a particularly complicated four books of more than one hundred and seventy five and this is not the topic of my talk because we will learn more there are the best minds in the world on this topic the prediction will get we will be confronted with decisions that we never had to face before about life about death about parenting so we are touching the very inner detail on how life works and it 's a revolution that cannot be confined in the domain of science or technology this must be a global conversation without fear but with the understanding that the decisions that we make in the next year will change the course of history forever thank"
