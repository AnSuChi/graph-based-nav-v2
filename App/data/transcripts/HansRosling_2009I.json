  "transcript": "once upon a time at the age of and that changed my mindset forever the course was good but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset it was the brutal realization the first morning that the indian students were better than me you see i was a study nerd i loved statistics from a young age and i studied very much in and the fact was that indian students studied harder than we did in sweden they read the textbook twice or three times or four times in sweden we read it once and then we went partying laugher and that to me that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset i grew up with was it 's not the statistics although i tried to make it funny and i will now try to predict when that will happen that that asia will and i will do that by will reach that of the west and i don 't mean the whole when will that have reached that of u k and the united states i will start at one thousand eight hundred and eight hundred and fifty eight was a year of great technological advancement in the west that was the year when queen victoria was able for the first time to and they were the first to twitter transatlantically and it ends like this this telegraph is and we will we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of india and india was up to eighty nine years more of foreign domination one thousand and that meant that foreigners as it said in the treaty to trade freely in china it meant paying with opium for chinese goods and one thousand eight hundred and fifty eight in japan was the year when japan had to sign the harris treaty and accept trade on favorable that had been in tokyo harbor over maintained its national sovereignty where you can see each bubble is a country the size of the bubble here is the population on this axis as i used to have income per person in comparable recyclable version here in green india china and i will start the world like this india was not always like this level actually if we go back into the historical record there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in india and china was even above that of europe but one thousand eight hundred and fifty had already been many many years of foreign domination and india had been and japan was starting to catch up india was trying down here can you see how it starts to move there but and it 's the new century now health is getting better united kingdom united states and the first world war you know we 'll see a lot of of of deaths and still under foreign domination and without sovereignty india and china are down in the corner not much has happened they have grown their population but not much more in the one thousand nine hundred and thirty 's now you can see that japan is going to a period of war with lower life and we are moving into the new world in one thousand nine hundred and and they could raise the indian flag and become a sovereign nation children started to go to school when china fell down it was central planning by mao tse tung china recovered then they said nevermore stupid central planning and we came to and it was deng xiaoping coming out here and he said doesn 't matter if a cat is white or black as long as it catches mice and they decided and the market reformer was now what does it mean that the the shanghai has already catched and if i split guizhou into urban and rural the you see this enormous inequity in china in the midst of fast economic growth and if i would also look at india you have another type of inequity actually in the geographical difference is not so big matching united states in health but not in economy and here maharashtra with mumbai is now in india the big inequities are within the state rather than between the states and that is not a bad thing in itself if you have a lot inequity inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living because washington d c is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as kerala it 's quite interesting for kerala helping fix the health system in the united states pushing forward you see that in between them and ahead of them is the whole emerging economies of the but in africa and other but most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast now back to my projections when will it catch up i have to go back to very conventional graph and we shall see what will happen with these countries whereas u k and united states is getting richer and richer and after second world war united states is richer than and with projection from imf you can see where you expect them to be in two thousand and fourteen now the question is when will the catch up take place but the financial bubbles that 's the dot com bubble this is the lehman brothers doorstep there and it seems this is this is another rock coming down there you know you see japan did it like that we add japan to it and there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place can you see here what japan did but the real projections for those ones i would like to give it like this be worse can be better it now a historian tells me it 's even more difficult to predict about the past inequalities in china and india i consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population you know the climate we have great international experts within india telling us that the climate is changing and i can agree on that but what i 'm really worried about is war will the former rich countries really and that vision that i got as a young student and it will happen precisely"
