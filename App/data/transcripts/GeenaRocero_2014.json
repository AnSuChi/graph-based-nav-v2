  "transcript": "the world makes you something that you 're not and that question burns in your heart how will you become but i am not alone not alone at all i felt that i 'd finally achieved the dream that i 'd always wanted since i was a young child my outside self finally matched my inner truth my inner self for complicated reasons which i 'll get to later when i look at this picture i realized that i 'm only just beginning all of us are put in boxes by our family by our religion by our society our moment in history even our own bodies some people have the courage to break free not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin those people are always the threat to the status quo to what is considered acceptable in my case for the last nine years i think in mystery this is called the reveal here is mine i was assigned boy at birth based on the appearance of my and my mom asked me how come you always wear that know it 's actually more fluid complex i never had the courage to share my story not because i thought what i am is wrong but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free every day i am so grateful because i am a woman i have a mom and dad many are not so fortunate there 's a long tradition in asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender there is a buddhist goddess of and i remember out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me and i remember that moment something hit me that is the kind of woman i would like to be t l she is a transgender beauty pageant manager that night she asked me how come you are not joining the beauty pageant she convinced me that if i joined that she would take care of the registration fee and that night i won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up among 40 plus candidates that moment changed my life all of a sudden i was introduced to the world of beauty so from fifteen to seventeen years old i joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it 's at the and when it rains it rains a lot in the philippines i also experienced the goodness of strangers especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the philippines i met some of my best friends in that community in two thousand and one my mom who had moved to san francisco called me and told me that i told my mom mom i 'm having fun i 'm here with my friends i love traveling being a beauty pageant but then two weeks later she called me she said did you know that if you move to the united states you could change your name and gender marker that was all i needed to hear my mom also told me to put two e 's in the spelling of my name she also came with me when i had my surgery in thailand at nineteen years old it 's interesting in some of the most rural cities in thailand they perform some of the most prestigious and sophisticated surgery and i remember looking at my california driver 's license with the name geena and gender marker f that was a powerful moment but for me that was my license to live to feel dignified many are not so fortunate she 's a young woman who was courageously living her truth but hatred ended her life for most of my community this is the reality in which we live our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general we have a global vigil for transgender day of remembrance p johnson and sylvia rivera today this very moment is my real coming out i could no longer live my truth i want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame so that one day there will never be a need for a november twenty vigil i 'm wondering what you would say especially to parents in a more broad way to friends to family to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that 's being assigned them what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them geena rocero sure and sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can 't accept it i would pick up that phone call and tell my mom mom can you call this woman and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn 't so but it 's it 's just gender identity is in the core of our being right i we 're all assigned gender at birth so what i 'm trying to do is to have this conversation that and there should be a space that would allow people to and that 's a conversation that we should have with with parents with colleagues the transgender movement it 's at the very beginning to compare to how the gay movement started there 's still a lot of work that needs to be done should be an understanding there should be a space of curiosity and asking questions and i hope all of you guys will be my allies"
