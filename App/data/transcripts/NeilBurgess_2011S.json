  "transcript": "when we park in a big so we 'll start with the hippocampus shown it 's made of neurons so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it and scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in and when it fires a little spike of electricity there 's going to be a red dot and a so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment so together they form a map for the rest of the brain telling the brain continually where am i now within my environment become active start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town well these two cells here so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of of the box that their rat 's in and when you expand the box the firing location and if you put another wall inside the box then the cell fires in both place wherever there 's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box so this predicts that which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it 's exploring around so the cell on the left you can see it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east whether it 's the edge or the the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table which the animals are running around and the cell on the right there fires whenever there 's a boundary to the south whether it 's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart so that 's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it 's exploring around we can also test where we think objects are like this goal flag in simple environments or but on some trials we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell in that case we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment and what you see example if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment and then if you ask people where it was but you 've made the environment bigger where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out it 's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across across all of your place cells at that location and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match so if we take some outbound path perhaps we park and we wander off we know because our own movements which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back and place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell but now as the rat explores around each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid and if you record from several grid cells shown here so the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one so together it 's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you 'd find on a map and as it moves around the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment it means that the net activity so we can put people which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats so back to homer and that would be represented by the firing of boundary detecting cells he 's also remembering the path he took out of the car park and he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern but he knows where it was so he knows to go and get it if we look for this grid like firing pattern throughout the whole brain we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks like remembering the last time so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so if this was happening your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint and grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space another kind of cell head direction cells which i didn 't mention yet they fire like a compass according to which way you 're facing they could define the viewing so this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we 're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even thank you very much"
