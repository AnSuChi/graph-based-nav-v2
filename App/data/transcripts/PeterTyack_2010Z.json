  "transcript": "thank you so much i 'm going to try to take you on it 's hard for us to really understand this so i 'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it but let 's also think as a visual species what it 's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look and what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient they can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females both to find one another and to select a mate the first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals whose world was so foreign to me was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds and i mentioned i 'll use some visual representations of sounds here 's the first example this is a plot of frequency it sounds sort of like tweeeeeet like that this is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer 's whistle if you hummed this tune to your dog or it 's really important for our music and our language so it 's a puzzle the few other mammal groups that do this why do they do it a lot of my career has been devoted to trying to understand many mammals have to produce contact calls when say a mother and calf are apart this is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch each individual here has a radically different call they can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals how about the setting in which animals need to use this call well let 's look at mothers and calves in normal life for mother and calf dolphin they 'll often drift apart or swim apart if mom is chasing a fish and when they separate what this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle against the maximum distance so when dolphins are separating but all of the time when they separate by more than one whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of of a dolphin but there are some exceptions when a male dolphin leaves mom as these two animals form a social bond their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar this plot shows two members of a pair as you can see at the top here share an up sweep like woop woop woop they both have that kind of up sweep whereas these members of a pair go and what 's happened is they 've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group it 's a very interesting way that they can form a new identifier for the new social group that they 've had let 's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dolphins the dolphins will start whistling they 'll change what they 're doing they 'll have a more cohesive group wait for the boat to go by and then they 'll get back so even in the situation that doesn 't look as bad as this it 's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work and if we look at a very pristine environment like western australia lars bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin watching boats when there was one boat not much of an impact and two boats when the second boat was added what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely of the ones that stayed their reproductive rate declined so it could have a negative impact on the whole population about activities that we thought were benign we may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems i 'd also like to point out that sound doesn 't and i 'd like to switch now from this local this is a kind of map we 've all been looking at the world is mostly blue but i notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land to me the most mind bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern indian ocean deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound that same sound but it 's still amazing to me has properties that allow low frequency sound the acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours it 's nearly halfway around the globe in the early ' 70s roger payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas but very few biologists believed it the whales clearly have evolved over tens of millions of years so blue whales and fin whales produce very low frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges the top plot here shows what happened was during the cold war the u s navy had a system that was secret at the time and after the berlin wall fell the navy made these systems available to whale this is a plot from christopher clark who tracked one individual blue whale as it passed by bermuda this shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles they 're ocean based and scale animals who are communicating over much longer ranges than we had anticipated fins and blues which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds so they can make a sound that 's a little higher in frequency broader band and more complicated so you 're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here humpbacks when they they 're listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what this means that humpback song is a form of animal culture just like music for humans would be i and this orange line here marks the typical songs but in ' ninety six they heard a few weird songs and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales until by one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight none of the whales sang the east coast song it was completely gone they just sang the cool new west coast song it 's as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old fashioned style before and with no golden oldies stations nobody sang the old ones i 'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls now you are listening to a recording made by chris clark zero point two miles away from a humpback you sound very nearby the next recording you 're going to you only hear the low frequencies you hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long range in the ocean and is not quite as loud now after i play back these humpback calls i 'll play blue whale calls but they have to be sped up because they 're so low in frequency that you wouldn 't be able to hear it otherwise here 's a blue whale call at fifty is the sound of a ship and i 'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it imagine that whale listening from five hundred miles there 's a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other this is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound and on the y axis is the loudness of of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency this line indicates sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth but right in the middle here where there 's a sweet spot thousands of human ships distant now in the pre industrial ocean as we were mentioning this whale call could be easily it 's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers let 's now take that additional increase in noise that we saw comes from shipping all of a sudden the effective range of communication goes from a thousand kilometers to ten kilometers now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they 're dispersed imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations have contact calls like i described for the dolphins i 'll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales now imagine let 's put the ship noise in the in the picture what 's a mother to do if the ship comes by and her calf isn 't there i 'll describe a couple strategies one strategy is if your call 's down here susan parks of penn state has actually studied this she 's looked in the atlantic here 's data from the south atlantic here 's a typical south atlantic contact call from the ' 70s look what happened by two thousand to the average call same thing in the north atlantic in the ' 50s versus two thousand over the last fifty years as we 've put more noise into the oceans these whales have had to shift it 's as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor it and we now know that whales can compensate for noise by calling louder like i did when that ship was playing by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band now there 's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be so we have to be very concerned and i 'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area looking at the impact of shipping on whales and they 've already found that by by being more intelligent about better propeller this is a whale that just squeaked and it 's very important to try to reduce this i the first case comes from the bay of fundy these black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the bay the colorized area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales because of the ships moving in this lane it turns out that this lane here well biologists who couldn 't take no for an answer went to the international maritime organization and petitioned them to say can those are just lines on the ground can 't you move them over to a place where there 's less of a risk and the international maritime organization responded very strongly these are the new lanes the shipping so it 's very promising actually we can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks gas emissions with global warming the maersk line but then they often wait there this reduced their fuel consumption by about thirty percent and we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities i hope these examples have shown some of the different directions we can take in addition to protected areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate thank you very much"
