  "transcript": "i 'm rich baraniuk and what i 'd like to talk a little bit about today are some ideas that i think have just tremendous resonance with all the things that have been talked about the last two days so many different points of resonance that it 's going to be difficult to bring them all up but i 'll try to do my best so these are right and i think it was best what 's happened in the music world is there 's a culture or an ecosystem the catchphrase that we create mix and burn what i mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed to create new music and musical ideas anyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical and people can burn them or create and what that 's done is it 's created like i said a vibrant community that 's very inclusive with people continually working to connect but i 'm not here to talk about music 'm here to talk about books in particular textbooks and the kind of educational materials that we use every day in school has anyone here ever been to school ok does anybody i 'm not going to spend too much time on that but what i want to talk about is some of the disconnects that that appear when an author publishes a book in fact the publishing process just because of the fact that it 's complicated it 's heavy books are expensive creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books be they teachers students i 'm going to call these people below the barrier shutouts because they 're that we 've seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books using them and teaching from them so that 's what i 'd like to talk about and really how we get from where we are now to to where we need to go the first thing i 'd like you to do is a little thought experiment imagine taking all the world 's books ok everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages so liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast interconnected global repository think of it as a massive itunes for for book type content imagine making it free so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge and imagine using information technology so that you can instead of editions of a book coming out every two years so that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors but all the people who could be or want to be authors in all the different languages of the world and i think if you could do this it would i 'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem so really this is the dream which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to nicholas negroponte 's talk yesterday where they 're working on the the hardware of bringing education to the world open source tools and the content so that 's sort of to put it in perspective here create what are some of the people that are that are using these kind of tools well the first thing is there 's a community of engineering professors from cambridge to kyoto who are developing engineering content in in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive super textbook the entire area of electrical engineering and not only that it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions a who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world on how to teach kids how to play music her material is now used over hundred thousand times per month tremendous use in fact a lot of this use coming from united states k 12 schools because and so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open free a having this be some of our most popular material in widespread use all over latin america and in particular in mexico because of the open extensible nature of this people volunteers and even companies that are translating materials into asian languages like chinese japanese and thai to spread the knowledge even further ok companies like national instruments who are embedding very powerful interactive simulations into the materials so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook to an experience that that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do we 've been working with teachers without borders who are very interested in mixing our materials they 're going to be using connexions as their their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach twb is currently in iraq training twenty thousand teachers supported by because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism that if you don 't empower people with the ability to other organizations we 've been working with people know about uc merced it 's a new university in california in the central valley working very closely with community colleges they 're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world which has a project called which is trying to bring internet connectivity connectivity to fifty percent of the world 's population by two thousand and fifteen we 're going to be providing content to them in a whole range of different languages we 've also been working with a number of other organizations in particular quite interesting burn is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these and i think a lot of you received i think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack a little present for you just to tell you quickly about it this is an engineering textbook it 's about three hundred pages long hardbound this costs anybody guess how much would it cost in a bookstore it would cost so what we 're seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular sort of customized to each individual class and published on demand very inexpensively either pushed out through amazon or published directly through an on demand press like qoop and i think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in the harry potter end right at the left side we 're talking about books on hypergeometric partial differential equations books that might sell one hundred copies a year one thousand copies a year there is tremendous sustaining revenue but also to sustain this new emergence of of on demand publishers like who produced these two books and i think one of the things that you you should take away from this talk is that there 's an impending so what are the enablers what 's really making all of this happen there 's tons of technology and the only piece of technology that i really want to talk about is xml how many people know about xml oh so it 's the future of the web right it 's semantic and what you can really think of xml in this case is it 's the packaging that we 're putting around these pages remember we took the book tore the pages out well what the xml is going to do is it 's going to turn those pages into lego xml are the nubs on the lego that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways and it provides us a a framework to to share content so so that every student can have a book or a course that 's that 's customized to their learning style indicating how fields as chris said i 'm an electrical engineering professor i teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math wow about half of you have already fallen fallen asleep just looking at the equation that links technology that links really cool applications like like music synthesizers to and the thing that i realized is there was no way that i as an engineer could write this book that would get all of this across we needed a community to do it and we needed new tools to be able to to interconnect these ideas and people who are teachers out here whoever taught you know this it 's the interconnections between ideas that that teaching is really all about one of your new e texts is something that you 're going to be able to explore and experiment with understand the same type of mark up like mathml for chemistry imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed imagine music xml understand it it 's no wonder that everybody 's getting into it right even the three wise men and we would be accused of [ piracy ] for doing much of it by big framework that makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable and the inspiration here is taken from open source software things like linux the creative commons licenses how many people have heard of creative commons if you have not you must learn about it clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute even to make commercial use of it as long as you in academic publishing and much of educational publishing it 's really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact that 's why people write not necessarily making bucks out there licensed with a creative commons license and there 's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of of re sampling ripping mixing burning and sharing ok i 'd like with just the last few points so we 've built this idea of a commons people are are using it we get over five hundred thousand unique visitors per month just to our particular site mit opencourseware which is another large open content site gets a similar number of of hits but how do we protect this how do we protect it into the future and the first thing that people are probably thinking is quality control right because we 're saying that anybody can anybody it didn 't take long until people started contributing materials for example on lingerie which is actually a pretty good module the only problem is it 's plagiarized from a major french points to a website so this is a little bit of a problem so we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in because chris and his team have ensured that things are very very high quality and what we 're doing is designing social software so that they can focus on the content in the repository that they think is is really important and you can think of ted as a potential lens connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge all of you here are tremendously imbued with with tremendous amounts of knowledge and what i 'd like to do is invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and and other projects of its type because i think together we can truly change the the landscape of education and educational publishing"
