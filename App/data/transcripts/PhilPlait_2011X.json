  "transcript": "i want to talk to you about something kind of and it was an explosion that was mind numbing that would be one take then you 're starting to get an idea of how much rock we 're talking the scale here is fifty miles on top a hundred kilometers on the bottom this thing was three hundred kilometers across two hundred miles an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet threw up enough dust to block out not all asteroids are that big some of them are smaller here is one that came in over the united states in why is that important because back then video cameras were just starting to become popular and parents would bring them to their kids ' football games to film their kids playing football and since this came in on a friday they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virginia maryland pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that this is not a but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right it is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock and in fact if any of you have ever been to near winslow arizona there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called meteor crater that 's a parking lot and so roughly the size blew up and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20 megaton nuclear bomb a very hefty but it probably would not have caused global devastation now in one thousand nine hundred and eight over siberia near the tunguska region for those of you who are dan aykroyd fans and saw ghostbusters when he talked about the greatest that 's fine i can live with that another rock came into the earth 's atmosphere the heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles and again this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we 're sitting in in meteor crater it was made of metal and metal is the one over tunguska was probably made of rock and that 's much more crumbly so it blew up in the air because they don 't have to hit necessarily to do this kind of damage they don 't have to do some of them we depend on more on the global economic basis that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization so now that i 've scared the crap out of you let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer for sixty five million years they 're very rare but probably but it 's still something to be aware of well but you can this is a rock that was about thirty yards across so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over tunguska and hit arizona fifty thousand years ago nasa has devoted money to this the national science foundation and other countries are interested in doing this we 're building telescopes that are looking for the threat what do we do you will if you 've heard about the mayan two thousand and twelve apocalypse you 're going to hear about apophis because you 're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway and it 's going to pass by the earth in april of and it 's going to pass us so close that it 's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites the earth 's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it 's just right if it passes through this region of space the earth 's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on april thirteen which is a friday i 'll note in the year you can 't plan that kind of stuff apophis is going to hit us the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go around are one in a million roughly very very low odds so i personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all i don 't think apophis is a problem in fact because it woke us up to the dangers of these things this thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now it won 't but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids we didn 't really necessarily understand let me ask you what happens if you 're standing in the road and a car 's headed for you what do you do nasa launched a probe called deep which we learned quite a bit about we did however think about this this thing is orbiting the sun at ten twenty miles per second we shot a space probe at it and hit it you know if you watch the movies why don 't we use a nuclear weapon well you can try that but the problem is timing shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you but just hitting something that 's pretty easy i think even nasa can do that and proved that they can we just pushed it into a keyhole and now it 's going to hit us in three years well so you don 't do that and this is the part it 's the part i just love after the big macho grr bam we 're gonna hit this thing in the face then we bring in the velvet gloves 's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves the b612 foundation for those of you who 've read the little prince you understand that reference i hope the little prince lived on an asteroid called b612 dan durda my friend who made this image works here at southwest research institute in boulder if we see an asteroid that 's going to hit the earth and we have enough time but then what we do is launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two it doesn 't have to be huge a couple of tons not that big and you park it near the asteroid you don 't land on it because these things are tumbling end over end it 's very hard to land on them instead you get near it has a little but it 's enough you can very easily finesse although that 's a whole other thing i won 't go into that but we 'd be rich right there are we have astronomers with this probe actually we invented something called an ion drive which is a very very very providing that very gentle push we have an ion drive now we don 't have the enterprise but we 've spock so it doesn 't have to happen to us the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and and so we can change our future thank you very much"
