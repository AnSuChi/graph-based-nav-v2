  "transcript": "and so my friends like to give me examples of their frustrations with computing and it 's bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess but what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and you 're supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems it 's tough at carnegie mellon they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our passwords the password requirement up through two thousand and nine was just that you had to have a password with at least one character and at the end of two thousand and this new policy required passwords that were at least eight characters long with an uppercase letter lowercase letter a digit a symbol you couldn 't use the same character more than three times and it wasn 't allowed to be in a dictionary and they said that the university had joined a consortium of universities and one of the requirements of membership was that we had to have stronger passwords that complied with some new requirements now the national institute of standards and technology has a set of guidelines which and the reason they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they don 't actually have any good data on passwords in fact their report states unfortunately we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules nist would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here so the first thing we did is we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus now we didn 't say give us your password does it have a digit does it have a symbol and so we got results from four hundred and seventy students faculty and staff but we also found that people said they felt more secure with these new passwords we found that most people knew they were not supposed to write their password down and only thirteen percent of them did because it makes makes you much more susceptible to attackers so if you have to write your passwords down but don 't reuse them we also found some interesting things about the symbols people possible symbols but as you can see there 's only a small number that most people are using so we 're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords so this was a really interesting study and now we had data from four hundred and seventy people but in the scheme of things that 's really not very much password data so it turns out there are a lot of people going around stealing passwords so we were able to get access to some of these stolen password sets because it 's not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords so we wanted to find some better source of data and pay people a penny ten cents a few dollars to do a task for amazon com and then we paid them again to come back two days later and log password had to have at least eight characters and pass a dictionary check and one of the other policies we tried and there were a whole bunch more but one of the ones we tried was called and the only requirement here was that your password had to have at least sixteen characters all right and so we had but as you may recall there isn 't a good measure of password strength so what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using or that we could find information about in the research literature they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form and so what they 'll do is they 'll make a guess as to what a password is run it through a hashing function and see whether it matches the passwords they have on their stolen password list so a dumb attacker will try every password in order they 'll start with and this is going to take a really long time before they get any passwords that people are really likely to actually have does something much more clever they look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets and they guess those first so they 're going to start by guessing password and then they 'll guess i love you all of these five thousand passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were we saw that people and the long passwords were a lot more usable and in some cases though some people had long passwords that actually weren 't very so we need to do more than just say long passwords there has to be some additional requirements and some of our ongoing research is looking at what additional requirements we should add to make for stronger passwords that also are going to be easy for people to remember and type these on the internet when you were creating passwords and if so so we tested password meters that were different sizes shapes colors different words next to them and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny what we found was that password meters do work most of the password meters were actually but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up and if they would just wait a little and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases and if you look at the second row of this cartoon you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase correct horse battery staple would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember he says in fact you 've already remembered it correct horse battery staple so we did the research study to see so in our study we used mechanical turk again and we had the computer pick the random words in the pass phrase now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words and so you 'd get pass phrases like try there three come and we looked at that and we said well that doesn 't really seem very memorable so then we tried picking words that came from specific parts of speech that comes up with something that 's sort of sentence like so you can get a pass phrase like plan builds sure power or end determines red drug maybe people would like those a little bit better but as you can see they don 't really very memorable and then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password so here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something sort of pronounceable like tufritvi and vadasabi that one kind of rolls off your tongue so these were random passwords that were generated by our computer so what we found in this study was that surprisingly pass phrases were not actually all that good they took longer to type and people made more errors while typing them in so it 's not really a clear win for pass phrases sorry all of you xkcd fans we did find that and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better so one of the problems with some of the studies that we 've done is that because they 're all done using mechanical turk these are not people 's real passwords they 're the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our and we wanted to know whether people would actually behave the same way with their real passwords so we talked to the information security office at carnegie mellon and asked them if we could have everybody 's real passwords not surprisingly they were a little bit reluctant to share them with us but we were actually able to work out a system with them where they put all of the real passwords for twenty five thousand cmu students faculty they ran the code and so we never actually saw anybody 's password we got some interesting results and those of you tepper students in the back will be very interested in this so we found that the the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually one point eight times stronger than those affiliated with the business school we have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well there was actually a lot of similarities and so this helped validate our research method and show that collecting passwords using these mechanical turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords so that was good news okay i want to close by talking about some insights i gained while on sabbatical last year in the carnegie mellon art school and i made this quilt here it 's called security blanket stolen from the rockyou website and the size of the passwords is proportional to how frequently they appeared in the stolen dataset and what i did is i created this word cloud and i went through all one thousand words and i categorized them into and it was in some cases it was kind of difficult to figure out what category they should be in color coded them so here are some examples of the difficulty so justin is that the name of the user their boyfriend their son maybe they 're a justin bieber fan or princess is that a nickname are they disney princess fans or maybe that 's the name of their cat iloveyou appears many times in many different languages there 's a lot of love in these if you look carefully you 'll see there 's also some profanity and there are animals 14th most popular password overall this was really curious to me and i wondered why are monkeys so popular and so in our last password study any time we detected somebody creating a password with the word monkey in it we asked them why they had a monkey in their password who have the word monkey we found out about a third of them said they have a pet named a friend whose nickname is monkey and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute and so it seems that at the end of the day when we make passwords we either make something that 's really easy to type a common pattern or things that remind us of the word password or the account that we 've created the password for or whatever or we and while this makes typing and remembering your password more fun it also makes it a lot easier to guess your password so i know a lot of these ted talks are inspirational and they make you think about nice happy things try to think about something else thank you"
