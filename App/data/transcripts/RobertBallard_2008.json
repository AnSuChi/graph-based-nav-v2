  "transcript": "the first question is this our country has two exploration programs one is and you can see we have sputnik and we have saturn and we have other the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and my question is this why are we ignoring the oceans or not the reason but here 's why i ask that question if you compare nasa 's annual budget to explore the heavens that one year budget would fund noaa 's budget to explore the oceans for one thousand six hundred years why and hell is down here is it a cultural issue why are people afraid of the ocean or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark place that has nothing to offer i 'm going to take you on a 16 minute trip and what we 're going to do is we 're going to immerse ourselves in my world and what i 'm going to try i hope i make the following points i 'm going to make it right now in case i forget everything i 'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when i went to school and most of all it was not even in my college textbooks i 'm a geophysicist and all my earth science books when i was a student i had to give the wrong answer to get an a in today 's context it was a bunch of crap but it was the law of geology vertical tectonics all the things we 're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans and everything we 're going to talk about represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse because that 's all we i have a characterization this is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it gives you the false impression it 's a map it is not a map in fact i but there are none over here and they go it 's amazing all right so we 're going to immerse ourselves in the seventy two percent of the planet because you know it 's really naive to think that the easter bunny put all the resources i believe in just enriching the economy and we 're leaving so much on the table seventy two percent of the planet and as i will point out later in the presentation fifty percent of the united states of america lies beneath the sea lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of mars than that fifty percent i began my explorations the hard way back then actually my first expedition was when i was i went out to sea on a scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave and i was too young to be you know i thought it was great i was a body surfer and i thought wow that was an incredible wave and we almost sank the ship but i became and over the last forty nine years i 've done about one hundred and twenty one hundred keep doing them a very small submarine and go down to the bottom i dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the earth maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we 've got going and so it 's very but i was enraptured and in my this is on a on a mercator projection but if you were to put it on an equal area percent of the earth 's total surface area almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn 't enter it until after neil armstrong and buzz aldrin went to the moon but the role it plays in the genesis of the earth 's outer skin because it 's along the axis of the it bleeds its molten blood rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere but no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it into the rift valley until a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of we went down into the rift valley this is all accurate except for one thing it 's pitch black it most of our planet is in eternal darkness and for that reason you do not have and so in our initial explorations we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation looking at the volcanic features running along that entire forty two thousand running along this entire forty two thousand miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes tens of thousands of active volcanoes there are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude it 's not just a but we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you 'd uplift it that 's why you get you know you get seashells up on mount everest it 's not a flood it was pushed up there we understood mountains under compression but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension it should not be until one of my colleagues said it looks to me like a thermal ridge must be a cooling curve we said let 's go find out we punched a bunch of heat probes everything made sense except at the axis there was missing heat but the only logical [ explanation ] was that there were hot huge giant chimneys we went up to them with our submersible we wanted to get a temperature probe we stuck it in there looked at it it pegged off scale the pilot made this great observation that 's hot and then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff it could have melted but it turns out the exiting temperature so the easter bunny has put things in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we 're making in this mountain range we 're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it was dwarfed a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist [ in ] giant tube worms ten feet tall i remember having to use vodka my own vodka to pickle it because we don 't carry formaldehyde we went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock large clams and when we opened them they didn 't look like a clam and when we cut them open they didn 't have the we were not predicting it we stumbled on it looking for some missing heat we wanted to accelerate this process we wanted to get away from this silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean twelve thousand feet two and half hours to get to work in the morning two and half hours to get to home five hour commute to work three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile we began to introduce that in our explorations and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic moving from one part of the mid ocean ridge to another the scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms they came across new creatures they had not seen before but more importantly they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand were not above a magma chamber they shouldn 't be there and we called it lost city and lost city was characterized by these incredible limestone formations and upside down pools look at that how do you do that that 's water upside down we went in underneath and tapped it and we found that it had the ph of drano all the way at the other end in an alkaline environment at a ph of eleven life existed so life was much more unbeknownst to them finding this time not upside down right side up bingo i 've never seen volcanoes of methane but of the mud coming out of the earth but driven by i 've never seen this before moving on there 's more than just natural history beneath the sea human history our discoveries of the titanic the realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on earth it contains we then found the yorktown people always ask did you find the right ship on the stern we 've been discovering these along ancient trade routes where they 're not supposed to be this shipwreck sank one hundred years before the birth of christ this one sank carrying a prefabricated home depot roman temple and then here 's one that sank at the time of homer at seven hundred and fifty b c more recently into the black sea where we 're exploring because there 's no oxygen there it 's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth we begin to excavate them we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their dna look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a of a carpenter look at the state of artifacts you still see the beeswax dripping when they dropped they sealed it fortunately we 've been able to convince congress we begin to go on the hill and lobby and we stole recently a ship from the united states navy the okeanos explorer on its mission its mission is as good as you could get its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet earth ok but certainly it 's going to be going to the unknown america this is that part of the united states that lies beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like i say the way we 're going to run this we have no idea what we 're going to discover we have no idea what we 're going to discover we 're going to discover an ancient shipwreck a phoenician off brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we 're going to run it like an emergency we 're going to connect our command center via a high bandwidth satellite link to a building we 're building at the university of rhode island called the interspace center and within that we 're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine blue gold team switching them off and on running twenty four hours a day a discovery is made that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later but then it 's connected through internet too the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway with ten gigabits of bandwidth we 'll go into areas we have no knowledge of it 's a big blank sheet on our planet we 'll map it within hours have the maps disseminated out to the major universities it turns out that ninety percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at twelve universities they 're all on i 2 we can then build a command center this is a remote center at the university of washington she 's talking to the pilot we can disseminate they can follow this expedition i 've started a program where are you jim jim young who helped me start a program called the jason project more recently we 've started and the excitement of live exploration to motivate but i will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it 's all being done you win or lose engineer or a scientist by the game is not over it and when we have the best middle schools in the world we 'll have the best kids pumped out of that system let me tell you because this is what we want this is what we want this is a young lady not watching a football game not watching and it 's just dawning on her what she 's seeing and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it 's in full [ receiving ] mode my final question why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea why do we have programs to build thank you very much"
