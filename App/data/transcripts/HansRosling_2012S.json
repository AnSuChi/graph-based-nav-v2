  "transcript": "but it 's a broad and very delicate and therefore i will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality it 's when the young couple whisper tonight we are going to make a baby my talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies this is indeed important and there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this three billion in one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven billion just last year and and it may continue like this to what extent are these people right two thousand there 's almost two billion this is a will the number of children increase each year up to fifteen years or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there i will tell you by the end of my speech when you want to classify religion it 's more difficult than you think you go to wikipedia and the first map you find is this it divides the world into abrahamic religions but that subdivides christianity islam and buddhism into many subgroups which was too detailed therefore at gapminder we and it looks like this it 's the religion where more than fifty percent of the people say that they belong it 's eastern religion in india and china and neighboring asian countries islam is the majority religion all the way from the atlantic ocean across the middle east southern europe and through asia all the way to indonesia that 's where we find islamic majority and christian majority religions and that is most countries in america and europe many countries in africa and a few in asia here are countries which cannot be classified because one religion does not reach fifty percent or there is doubt about the data or there 's some other reason so we were careful with that so and now i show the number of babies per woman here two or six the exception was japan otherwise it was only christian countries but they were in latin america or they were in africa and countries with and all the eastern religions except japan had the same level now let 's see what i start the world and here we go now one thousand nine hundred and sixty two can you see they 're getting a little richer but the number of babies per woman is falling look at china they 're falling fairly fast and all of the muslim majority countries across the income are coming down as do the christian and when we enter into this century you 'll find more than half of mankind down here and by two thousand and ten we are actually eighty percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman it 's a quite amazing development which has happened i can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries we get and then when we look at at religions we can see that the eastern religions indeed there 's not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than whereas with you see countries all the way but there 's no major difference but like yemen and afghanistan many think that afghanistan here and congo which have suffered severe conflicts that they don 't have fast population growth because the death of a child is compensated by one more child these countries have six children per woman but thirty years from now afghanistan will go from thirty million to sixty million congo will go from sixty to one hundred and twenty and many think that these countries i take them backwards here they 've gone all the way down to between four and five it you need to have access to some family if i take these countries back to the years of their independence which is almost the same and what is the reason in qatar i do as i always do i went to the statistical authority of qatar to their webpage it 's a very good webpage i recommend it and i looked up you can have lots of fun here and i looked at total fertility rate per increased educational level of qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force i couldn 't agree more there are countries up here which are very poor and that 's where family planning better child and it 's two but we have definitely reached peak but why do they grow if the number of children doesn 't grow each card box is one billion there are two billion young people between fifteen and thirty these are rounded numbers then there is one billion between thirty and forty five and then it 's my box this is me 60 plus we are here on so what will happen now is what we call the big fill up you can see that it 's like three billion missing here they are not missing because they 've died they were never born so what will happen now is quite straightforward the old sadly the rest of you you will grow older and you will get two billion children and then again the old will die and you will get two billion children this is the great fill up it can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman all the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world access to some family planning"
