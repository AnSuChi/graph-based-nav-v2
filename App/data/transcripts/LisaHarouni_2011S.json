  "transcript": "reality today that you can download products from the web product data i should say from the web perhaps tweak it and personalize it to your own preference or your own taste and have that information sent to a desktop machine we can actually build for you very rapidly a physical object and the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing or 3d printing they have been around for almost thirty years now which is quite amazing to think of but they 're only just starting to filter into the public arena which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3d and we would pass that data with material into a machine and a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that but if these machines have been around for almost thirty years why don 't we know about them because typically they 've been inaccessible they 've not been fast enough they 've been quite expensive but today becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful many barriers are breaking down that means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines if not this minute so how does it work which is a product design data created on professional product design programs and here you can see an engineer it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer create a product in 3d and this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into of that product all the way through almost like slicing it like salami and that data layer by layer gets passed through the machine starting at the base of the product and depositing material layer upon layer infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer and this material that 's deposited either starts as a liquid material powder form and the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting in this case we can see a laser sintering machine developed by eos it 's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer but it is reality today and phone covers out of plastic all the way through to spinal implants for example 'll notice about all of these products is they 're very very intricate the design is quite extraordinary because we 're taking this data in 3d form slicing it up before it gets past the machine we can actually create structures that are more intricate than any other manufacturing technology or in and this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of and you can actually walk into it and on the other end of the spectrum this is a microstructure it 's so really the resolution is quite incredible the detail that you can get today is quite amazing so who 's using it typically because we can create products very rapidly it 's been used by product designers or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design there 's very little economies again you can see this is a again not buildable in any other way and very hard to even create this by hand now this is an engine very detailed inside with the design now 3d printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production actually sitting here you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it it 's more efficient and it 's used by aerospace it 's a lighter part and uses less material waste so it 's overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products and then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within typically an implant is more effective within the body if it 's more porous because our body tissue will grow into it but it 's very hard to create that in standard ways with 3d printing and in fact because we can create bespoke products en masse one offs we can create implants that are specific to individuals as the detail is improving the quality is improving the price of the machines you can buy a machine today for that you can create yourself because simply most of us here today don 't know how to create the data that a 3d printer reads you wouldn 't know how to direct it to make what you want it to but there are more and more i believe we 're at a tipping point where this is now something that we can 't you can download products from the web anything you would have on your desktop you need a spare part but you realize that that hoover 's been discontinued can you imagine going online this is a reality and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information that data and having the product and in fact because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making but what interests my company the most is the fact that you can create individual unique products en masse there 's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in china you can just make it physically on the spot which means that we can now present to the public the next generation of customization this is something that is now possible today that you can direct personally how you want your products to look we 're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization brands like nike are doing it it 's all over the web in fact every major household name is allowing you to interact with their products on a daily basis all the way from smart cars to prada but this is not really mass customization it 's known as variant production variations of the same product what you could do is really influence your product now i 'm not sure about you guys but i 've had experiences when i 've walked into a store and i 've know exactly what i 've wanted and i 've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that i know where i want to sit in my house and i just can 't find the right thing or that perfect piece of jewelry as a gift or for myself imagine that you can now engage with a brand and you can today download a product with software like this this is a lamp and you can start iterating the design you can direct what color that product will and also you can engage in shape manipulation of that product but within boundaries that are safe because obviously the public are not professional product designers the piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible and when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design they click enter and this data gets converted into the data that a 3d printer reads and gets passed to but i don 't think that that 's immediate i don 't think that will happen soon what 's more likely and we 're seeing it today is that that data gets sent we 're now instead of shipping a this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later it 's this lamp as you can see here you can use it for functional customization scanning parts of the body and creating or we can create very specific prosthetics for that individual you can have your teeth scanned and dental coatings made in this way to fit you and the idea of now creating implants scanning data an mri scan of somebody can now be converted into 3d data and we can create very specific implants and applying this to the idea of building up what 's in our bodies you know this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree it 's very intricate you couldn 't really create this or simulate it in any but with mri data we can just build the product as you can see very intricately and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts valves kidneys now this is not without a doubt in my mind i believe that this technology is going to cause a manufacturing revolution and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it thank you"
