  "transcript": "they are the things the victims of genocide in bosnia carried with them on their final journey we are all familiar everyday objects the fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them usually they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war these items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland and as we speak forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves twenty years after the war and it is quite possibly largest ever discovered went missing presumed killed when u n safe zones like srebrenica fell the hands of the serb army the international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide genocide religious or ethnic group as much as genocide is about it is about the denied identity there are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them these items are recovered from numerous mass graves and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings the first act of genocide on european soil since the holocaust once recovered these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on csi but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials but physical an ineffective and painful process believe it or not i decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse i like to give back to the community i like to move beyond raising awareness someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened i am merely a tool a forensic if you like and the result once all the missing persons are identified only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain in all their simplicity these items thank you very much"
