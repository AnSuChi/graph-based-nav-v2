  "transcript": "but before i do that i need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics which require huge amounts of energy to create and because of their disposal issues are slowly poisoning our planet i also want to tell you and share with you how my team and i have been using mushrooms over the last three years not like that which perform a lot like plastics during their use but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives but first i need to talk to you about what i consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category but i like to think of it as toxic white stuff in a single cubic foot of this material about what would come around your computer or large television you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol yet after just a few weeks of use and this isn 't just found in packaging and that 's not the only place it 's found even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment on the side of the perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans they 're not biologically compatible and because these materials are so prolific because they 're found in so many places there 's one other place you 'll find this material which is made from benzene a known carcinogen you 'll find it inside of you power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you we recognize this is a finite we should be talking about half a quarter one tenth the energy content and lastly and i think perhaps we should be creating materials that fit into what i call nature 's recycling system but nature provides us with a really good model here when a tree 's done using its leaves its solar collectors these amazing molecular photon capturing devices at the end of a season doesn 't pack them up take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves it just drops them the shortest distance possible to the forest floor and this and what we by using a part of the mushroom you 've probably never seen analogous to its root structure it 's called mycelium because it 's a self assembling material it actually takes things we would consider waste things like seed husks or woody biomass and can transform them into a chitinous polymer which you can form into almost any we basically use it and by using mycelium as a glue you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry and you can create materials with many different properties materials that are insulating but these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts not the next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool physically filling an enclosure a mold in whatever shape you want to get then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles and that 's where the magic happens because the organism is doing the work in this process not the equipment the final step is of course the product whether it 's a packaging material a table top or building block if you 're in china you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull if you 're in northern europe or north america we then process these husks with some basic equipment and i want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale and what they 're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium this gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape though today we 're making corner blocks and it 's when this lid goes on the part that the magic really starts because the manufacturing process is our organism it assemble them into biocomposites entire facility self assembling materials and everything from building materials so i 've said a number of times that we grow materials and so my team has taken five days worth of growth a typical growth cycle for us and condensed it into and i want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen because over the five day period what they do is extend out and through this material using the energy that 's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix self assembles growing through and around the particles making millions and millions of tiny but it 's much faster than conventional farming the last step of course is application in this case we 've grown a corner block but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance best of all and it 's going to improve the local soil because you have because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process you don 't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility so you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world even the parts that aren 't digested become part of the structure we 're getting incredible yield rates natural polymers and while today we can practically guarantee that yesterday 's packaging is going to be here in ten thousand years what i want to guarantee our descendants our children 's children will be living happily and in harmony thank you"
