  "transcript": "but evolutionarily two million years is nothing and yet in two million years the human brain has nearly what is it and one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part called the lobe particularly a part called the pre frontal cortex what pre frontal cortex does lots of things but one of the most important things it does is an experience pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don 't make real mistakes in planes human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life this is a trick that none of our ancestors could do and that no other animal can do quite like we can it 's a marvelous adaptation it 's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall and it 's not because they whipped some up tried it and went yuck it 's because without leaving your armchair you can simulate that flavor and say yuck before you make let 's see how your experience simulators are working let 's just run a quick diagnostic before i proceed with the rest of the talk here 's two different futures that i invite you to contemplate and the other is becoming paraplegic because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs and a year after winning the lotto lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives don 't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time the research that my laboratory has been doing that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing has revealed something really quite startling to us something we call the impact bias which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly for the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are from field studies to laboratory studies we see that winning or losing an election gaining or losing a romantic partner getting or not getting a promotion passing or not passing a college test on and on almost floors me a recent study showing how it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness i am more invulnerable than achilles fortune it turns out it 's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have human beings have something that we might think of as a psychological immune system a system of cognitive processes largely non conscious cognitive processes that help them change their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves you don 't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing you don 't have to look very far for evidence i took a copy of the new york times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness one minute 's regret it was a glorious experience i believe it turned out for the best who are these characters who are so damn happy the first one is jim wright some of you are old enough to remember he was the chairman of the house of representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young republican named newt gingrich found he lost everything the most powerful democrat in the country lost everything he lost his money he lost his power he 's pretty much covered them there moreese bickham is somebody you 've never heard of moreese bickham uttered these words upon being released he was harry s langerman uttered these words and he 's somebody you might have known but didn 't because in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine he read a little article in the paper about they said we can give you a franchise on this for three thousand bucks harry went back to it turns out people do eat hamburgers and ray kroc for a while became the richest man in america until they you know sent him out on an errand and snuck well in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four when pete best was interviewed yes he 's still a drummer he 's a studio musician he had this to say i 'm happier than i would have been with the beatles okay here it is finally to be revealed first accrue wealth power and prestige then lose it second spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can third make somebody else because when people synthesize happiness as these gentlemen seem to have done we all smile at them but we kind of roll our eyes and say yeah right you never really wanted the job oh yeah right you really didn 't have that much in common with her and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your we smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call natural happiness what are these terms natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don 't get what we wanted and in our society we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind why do we have that what kind of economic engine would keep churning with all apologies to my friend matthieu ricard a shopping mall full of zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable because they don 't want stuff enough i want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for i 'm let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks and this and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked in this case because this experiment uses them these are monet prints now we give you a choice we happen to have number three and number four we tell the subject this is a bit of a difficult choice sometime later it could be fifteen minutes it could be fifteen days the same stimuli are put before the subject and the subject is asked to re rank the stimuli tell us how much you like them now what happens you 're watching happiness be synthesized would you like to see it again happiness the one i got is really better than i thought that other one i didn 't get sucks that 's the synthesis of happiness now what 's the right response to that yeah right now here 's the experiment we did and i hope this is going to convince you that yeah right was not the right response we did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia these are hospitalized patients most of them have korsakoff 's syndrome a polyneuritic psychosis but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room when you come back they don 't know who you are we took our monet prints to the hospital and we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least we then gave them the choice between number three and number four like everybody else they said gee thanks doc that 's great i could use a new print i 'll take number three we explained we would have number you don 't remember i was just here with the monet prints sorry doc i just don 't have a clue no problem jim all i want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one we ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own which one they chose last time which one is theirs and what we find is amnesiac patients but if i do this with amnesiac patients they don 't have a clue they can 't pick their print out of a lineup here 's what normal controls do they synthesize happiness right this is the change in liking score the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked normal controls show that was the magic i showed you now i 'm showing it to you in graphical form but they don 't know they own it yeah right is not the right response what these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people and some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do it turns out the ability to make up your mind and change your mind is the friend of natural happiness because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most dilbert already knows of course dogbert 's tech support how may i abuse you my printer prints a blank page after every document why complain about getting free paper free aren 't you just giving me my own paper look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same people accept the things they cannot change indeed the psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck when we are trapped this is the difference between dating and marriage you go out on a date with a guy and he picks his nose you don 't go out on another date you 're married to a guy and he picks his nose he you find a way to be happy with what now what i want to show you is that people don 't know this about themselves and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage here 's an experiment we did at harvard we created a black and white photography course and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom so we gave them cameras they went around campus they took twelve pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their their dog and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memories of they figure out which are the two best pictures and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms and they blow two of them up and they have two gorgeous eight by 10 glossies of meaningful things to them and we say which one would you like to give up i have to give one up yes we need one as evidence of the class project so you have to give me one you have to make a choice you get to keep one and i get to keep one now there are two conditions in this experiment in one case the students are told but you know if you want to change your mind i 'll always have the other one here and in the next four days before i actually mail it to headquarters headquarters i 'll be glad to swap it out with you in fact i 'll come to your dorm room just give me an email better yet check with you you ever want to change your mind it 's totally returnable the other half of the students are told exactly the opposite half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they 're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking satisfaction with the pictures and look at what we find first of all here 's what students think is going to happen they think they 're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose but these are not statistically significant differences it 's a very small increase and it doesn 't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition bad simulators because here 's what 's really happening both right before the swap and five days later people who are stuck with that picture who have no choice who can never change their mind i gotten the right one maybe this isn 't the good one maybe i left the good one have killed themselves they don 't like their picture and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired they still don 't like so here 's the final piece of this experiment we bring in a whole new group of naive harvard students and we say you know we 're doing a photography course and we can do it one of two ways we could do it so that when you take the two pictures you 'd have four days to change your mind or we 're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it which course would you like to be in duh sixty six percent of the students to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind hello because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness and he 's making my point here but he 's making it tis nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so it 's nice poetry but that can 't exactly be right is there really nothing good or bad is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to paris are just the same thing that seems like a they can 't be exactly the same in more turgid prose but closer to the truth was the father of modern capitalism adam smith and he said this this is worth contemplating the great source of both the misery and disorders of human life but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly we should have preferences that lead us into one future over but when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures we are at we 're thoughtful when our fears are unbounded and we 're cowardly the lesson i want to leave you with from these data is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience"
