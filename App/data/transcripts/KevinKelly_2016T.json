tendencies and those tendencies are derived from the very and they will make reoccurring patterns again and again and so those patterns produce these these tendencies these leanings you can almost it 's downward and so these and urgencies in technological systems give us a sense of where things are going at the large so in a large sense i would say that but twitter was not so we have many ongoing tendencies right now and i think one of the chief among them is this tendency to make things smarter and smarter i call and i think that 's going to be one of the most influential developments and trends and directions and drives in our society in the next twenty years we already have ai and often it works in the background in the back offices of hospitals where it 's used to diagnose x rays better than a human doctor it 's in legal offices where it 's used to go through legal evidence better than a human paralawyer it 's used to fly the plane that you came here with human pilots only flew it seven to eight minutes the rest of the time the ai was driving and of course in netflix and we have an example of course in a more front facing aspect of it with the but it 's more than that if you play a video game you 're playing against an ai but recently google taught their ai to actually learn how to play video games again teaching video games was was already done but learning how to play a video game that 's artificial smartness what we 're doing is is taking this artificial smartness and we 're making it smarter and smarter there are three i think these things also would help us embrace ai because it 's only by embracing it that we actually can steer it very poor understanding of what intelligence is it starts like with and then maybe there 's more in a stupid person and then maybe an average person like myself and then maybe a genius and this it 's much more like a symphony of different notes and each of these notes is played on a different we have deductive reasoning we have emotional intelligence we have spatial intelligence we have maybe one hundred they also have another but they may have a different arrangement and maybe they 're higher in some cases than humans like long term memory in a squirrel is actually but in other cases they may be lower when we go to make machines we 're going to engineer them in the same way where we 'll make so so your calculator is smarter than you are google we 're going to take again these kinds of different types of thinking and we 'll put them into like a car the reason why we want to put them in a car so the car drives is because it 's not driving like a human it 's not worrying about whether it left the stove on or whether it should have majored in and we actually might even come to advertise these as so in general what we 're trying to do is make as many different types of thinking as we can we 're going to populate the space of all the different possible types or species of thinking and there two step program which is to invent new kinds of thinking that we can work alongside of to solve these really large problems say like dark energy or what we 're doing is making alien intelligences you might even think of this as sort of and they 're going to help us think different because thinking different is the engine of creation and wealth and new new economy the first industrial revolution was based on the fact that we invented something i would call artificial power everything that was made had to be made with human muscle or animal power that was the only way to get anything done the great innovation during the industrial revolution was we harnessed fossil fuels to make this artificial power that we could you are with a flick of the switch commanding two hundred and fifty horses two hundred and fifty horsepower which we can use to build skyscrapers to build cities to build roads to make factories that would churn out lines of chairs or or refrigerators way beyond our own power that artificial power farmstead and anybody could buy that artificial power just by plugging something in so this was a source of innovation as well because a farmer could take a and they could add this artificial power this electricity and he 'd have an electric pump and that formula was what brought us the industrial revolution all the things that we see all this progress that we now enjoy that we 're now going to the formula for the next ten thousand that is the formula that 's what we 're going to be doing and that is the way in which we 're going to make this second industrial revolution and by the way right now this minute you can log on to google and you can purchase ai for six cents one hundred hits that available right now so the third aspect of this and robots are going to be bots they 're going to be doing many of the tasks that we have already done so they 're going to redefine our jobs because they 're going to do some of those but they 're also going to create whole new categories a whole new slew of tasks that we didn 't know we wanted to do before they 're going to actually engender new kinds of jobs new kinds of tasks that we want done just as automation made up a whole bunch of new things that we didn 't know we needed before and now we can can 't live without them so they 're going to produce even more jobs than they take away but it 's important that a lot of the tasks that that can be defined in terms of efficiency or productivity if you can specify a task either manual or productivity is for robots what we 're really good at is basically it runs on that fact that you have one failure after another it runs on the fact that you make tests and experiments that don 't work otherwise you it runs on the fact that there is not a lot of efficiency in it innovation by definition is inefficient because you make prototypes because you try stuff that fails that doesn 't efficiency is for robots we 're also going to learn that we 're going to work with these ais because they think differently than us when deep blue beat the world 's best the best chess champion in the world is not an ai and it the best medical diagnostician is not a we 're going to be working with these ais and i think you 'll be paid in the future by how well you work with these going to be something we work with rather than against we 're working with these rather than against them so the future where does that take us i think that compared to what we 're going to have twenty five years from now are no ai experts right now there 's a lot of money going to it there are billions of dollars being spent on it it 's but there are no experts compared to what we 'll know twenty years from now so we are just at the beginning of the beginning we 're in the first hour of all this we 're in the first hour in the first hour of what 's coming the most popular ai product thank you"
