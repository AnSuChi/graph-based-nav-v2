in twelve to forty eight hours now why would i suggest that producing drought tolerant crops will go towards providing food security well and it 's estimated that be between nine and ten billion people with the bulk of this growth the food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a seventy percent increase in current agricultural practice to meet that demand most of that 's going to have to come from plants that percentage of seventy percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change this is taken from a study by dai published in two thousand and eleven where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them amongst other things increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain the areas in red shown here are areas that until recently have been very successfully used for agriculture but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall this is the situation that 's predicted to happen in two thousand and fifty much of africa in fact much of the world is going to be in trouble we 're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food the other thing to remember about africa is that most of their crops is not the easiest thing in the world and the reason for this is water actively metabolizing all life reactions happen in water you and i are sixty five percent water we lose one percent of that we die but we can make behavioral changes to avoid that and so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us about ninety five percent water but for short periods most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss they tend to be small but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly they send down very deep roots mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times keeping themselves hydrated on the right is called a baobab it 's also called the simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down and of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant and probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies flowering of the desert the strategy in annuals is to grow only in the rainy season and anything that is that dry and still alive we call in the desiccated state what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment for prolonged periods of time the next time the rainy season comes it 's widely believed that the evolution of seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering rice and maize form ninety five percent of our plant food supplies and it 's been a great strategy because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed seeds are energy rich so there 's a lot of food calories you can store it in times of the vegetative tissues the roots and leaves of of annuals do not have much by way of inherent resistance avoidance or tolerance characteristics they just don 't need them they grow in the rainy season and they 've got a seed and so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance avoidance and tolerance particularly resistance and avoidance because we 've had good models to understand how those work two weeks without rain and it 's dead there is a solution remain in a dry dead like state for months to years and give them water and this is a really rare phenomenon there are only one hundred and thirty five flowering plant species that can do this i 'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process and at the bottom there 's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens years trying to understand how they do this how do these plants dry without shown here in the hydrated and dry states for a number of reasons one of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that i 'd like to make drought tolerant for example is a grass it 's called eragrostis nindensis it 's got a close relative called it 's a staple food in ethiopia it 's gluten free and it 's something we would like to make drought tolerant the other reason for looking at a number of plants is that at least initially i wanted to find out do they do the same thing so i undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant for example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure what are the proteins made in response to drying so we look at the now this is important because plants are stuck in the ground they use what i call a highly tuned chemical arsenal so it 's important that we look at the chemical changes lipidome the lipid changes take away the water those membranes fall apart lipids also act as signals to turn on genes then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the and then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment i 've always had the philosophy that i needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance i 'm sure some of you are thinking by biotic application does she mean she 's going to make genetically modified crops and the answer to that question is depends on your definition of genetic modification all of the crops that we eat today wheat rice and maize your answer is yes in the essence of time we have tried that approach more appropriately but we 're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop they 're i leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called gm or not i 'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach and in order to do that i have to explain a little bit about how genes work so you probably all know that genes are made of double stranded dna it 's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant 's body and each gene has a promoter the next gene will start now promoters are not simple on off switches they normally require a lot of so what 's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter in the study that i 'm going to talk to you about my collaborators used a drought induced promoter which we discovered in a resurrection plant the nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing the plant itself senses drought and we 've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants all stresses particularly drought stress so here 's some data from a maize strain that 's very popularly used in africa to the left of the arrow are plants without the genes to the right plants with the antioxidant genes after three weeks without watering the my research has shown that there 's considerable similarity so i ask the question are they using the same genes or slightly differently phrased are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants and i answer that question mel oliver in the united states and julia buitink in france the where the chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance so as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development they switch these genes on resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out all modern crops therefore have these genes in their roots and leaves they just never switch them on they only switch them on in seed tissues to mimic the process in crops and just a final thought what we 're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some ten to forty million years ago my plants and i thank you for your attention"
