  "transcript": "at the break i was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate and this will be my only comment on it and that is i understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists what i 'm going to tell you about in my eighteen minutes is how we 're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves it 's only ten years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free living organism that of haemophilus influenzae that took a genome project from thirteen years down to four months most human pathogens a couple of plants several insects genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over ten years ago was by the end of this year we might have between three and five genomes sequenced it 's on the order of several hundred we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence one hundred and thirty genomes this year so the rate of reading the genetic code has and maybe it 's something that people in oxford don 't do very often but if you ever keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria less than five thousand microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it and we started the sorcerer ii expedition we started in bermuda then across the pacific and we 're in the process now of working our way across the indian ocean it 's very tough duty we 're doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people the experiments are incredibly simple we just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters and with doing this we 've made some amazing discoveries for example it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments it turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication from one site from one barrel of we 've extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums laughter we filter through some simple apparatuses we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in new york city and we 're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time we 're finding that almost every two hundred miles we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients so this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures red being warm blue being cold and we found there 's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples in terms of abundant species the other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence and these vary tremendously from region to region maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where it 's mostly blue when there 's a lot of chlorophyll around they see a lot of green light but they vary even more possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was we assembled all the data and we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are are we just discovering new members of known families or are but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families so we 're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes up on the upper right hand corner with the animals of those roughly twenty nine million genes we only have around twenty four thousand in our genome and if you take all animals together we probably share less than thirty thousand and probably i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution and we think in a gene centric view maybe going back to richard dawkins ' ideas than in a genome centric view which are different constructs of these gene components synthetic dna the ability to synthesize dna has changed at sort of the same pace that dna sequencing has over the last decade or and is getting very rapid and very cheap our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five and we have really nice t shirts that say you know i heart my genitalium this is actually just a microorganism but it haemophilus had so we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those but it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you can only define an essential or non essential gene based on exactly what 's in the environment we also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of thirteen related organisms and we tried to compare all and we got these overlapping circles and we found only one hundred and seventy three genes common the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around three hundred and ten or so so we think that we can expand or contract genomes depending on your point of view here to maybe three hundred to four hundred genes from the minimal of five hundred and we had to do this in a cassette based fashion we found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult ham smith and clyde hutchison my colleagues on this developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize that was one hundred percent accurate injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden that dna started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria this was not the first synthetic virus a polio virus had been made a year before but it was only one ten thousandth as active and it took three years to do this is a cartoon of the structure of phi x one hundred and seventy four this is a and that 's the notions that we have with biology basically any virus that 's been sequenced today that genome can be made and people immediately freak out about things about ebola or the real concern that security departments have is designer viruses and there 's only two countries the u s and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents if that research is truly discontinued there should be very little activity on the know how to make designer viruses in the future i think single cell organisms are possible within two years and possibly eukaryotic cells those that we have are possible within a decade so we 're now making several dozen different constructs and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome this is derived from an organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed it reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about twelve to twenty four hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart this organism is ubiquitous on the planet and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation the glass started to burn and crack while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier here 's an actual picture of what happens the top of this shows the genome after one point seven it 's truly stunning that these organisms can do that and we probably have thousands if not tens of thousands of different species on this so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues for example from the third organism we sequenced methanococcus jannaschii it lives in boiling water temperatures its energy source is hydrogen and all so we know lots of different pathways thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 and can capture that back so instead of using carbon from oil we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere we have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen also there 's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane and dupont has a major program with statoil in norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields within a short while i think there 's going to be a new field called combinatorial genomics because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day you get selection through screening we 're trying to photosynthesis is modulated this process we 're also combining cellulases the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes the chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce i think future engineered species hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps we delayed bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species the only"
