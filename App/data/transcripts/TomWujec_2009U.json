  "transcript": "last year at ted we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called big viz and the big viz is a collection of six hundred and fifty sketches that were made by two visual artists david sibbet from the grove and the consensus was it really worked these sketches brought to life the key ideas the portraits the magic moments that we all experienced last year this year we were thinking why does it work what is it about animation graphics and this is an important question to ask and answer because cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn 't actually see the world as it is but instead creates a series of mental models through a collection of ah ha most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain at the primary visual cortex and primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry just the simplest of shapes but it also acts like a kind of relay station that information to many other parts of the brain as many as thirty other parts that selectively make more sense create more meaning through the kind of ah ha experiences we 're only going and this is the part of the brain that will look at a hand look at a book so that 's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something and what it does is locates the object in physical body space so if you look around the stage here you 'll create a kind of mental map of the stage you closed your eyes you 'd be able to mentally navigate it you 'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that and it 's the part that feels it 's the kind of gut center where you see an image and you go oh i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i 'm seeing so the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways well again the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at the brain processes this in parallel the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model so for example when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to to selectively create a visual logic so the act of engaging and looking at the image creates the meaning it 's the selective logic now we 've augmented this and spatialized this information many of you may remember the the magic wall that we built in conjunction with perceptive pixel where we quite literally create an infinite so the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning it activates a different part of the and then the limbic system is activated when we see motion when we see color and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we 've heard about before the lessons for us are and the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence these are techniques that can be used to be that can be applied in a wide range of and it 's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else there 's always a room always a place to be able to that out so the act of collectively and collaboratively building the image transforms but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on and this can be enhanced and augmented with and this is an emerging set of technologies that use large screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible here what we can do is look at sustainability quite secondly making them interactive and then thirdly making them persistent and i believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today"
