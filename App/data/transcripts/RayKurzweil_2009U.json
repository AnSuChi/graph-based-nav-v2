  "transcript": "information technology grows in an exponential manner it 's not linear and our intuition is linear when we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be and that 's hardwired in our brains but the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies and it 's not just computation there is a big difference between linear and exponential growth if i take thirty steps linearly one two three four five i get to thirty if i take thirty steps exponentially two four eight sixteen i get to a billion it makes a huge and that really describes information technology when i was a student at mit we all shared one computer that took up a whole building the computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper a million times and we 're going to do it again in the next twenty five years information technology progresses through a series of and it doesn 't just apply to computation it 's really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties here we have trillions fold increase since the and ninety census in 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes making them smaller and smaller they finally hit a wall they couldn 't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum and that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing we went to the fourth paradigm when that comes to an end we 'll go to the sixth paradigm but what 's even more amazing really than this fantastic scale of progress is that look at how predictable this is i mean this went through thick and thin through war and peace through boom times and recessions the great depression made not a dent in this exponential progression the same thing in the economic recession we 're having now at least the exponential growth of information technology capability and i just updated these graphs because i had them through two thousand and two in my book the singularity is near so we updated them so i could present it here to two thousand and seven and i was asked well aren 't it kind of didn 't stay on this exponential progression i was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn 't be right but but look at how predictable this is and the cost of a transistor cycle which is a measure of the price performance of electronics comes down about every year that 's a fifty percent deflation rate and it 's also true of other examples like dna data or brain data but we more than make up for that we actually ship more than twice as much of every form of information technology we 've had eighteen percent growth in constant dollars in every form of information technology for the last fact that you can get twice as much of it each year this is a completely different example this is not moore 's law the cost has come down by half skeptics you 're halfway through the genome project and you 've finished one percent of the project but that was really right on schedule because if you double one percent seven more times which is exactly what happened you get one hundred percent and the project was finished on time communication technologies fifty different ways to measure this but this has progressed at an exponential pace this is deeply democratizing over twenty years ago in the age of intelligent machines when the soviet union was going strong that it would be swept away by this growth of decentralized and we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain but where will we get the software some critics say oh well software is stuck in the mud the amount of data we 're getting about the brain is doubling every year and we 're showing that we can actually turn this data regions of the visual cortex cerebellum where we do our skill formation slices of the cerebral cortex where we do our rational and we 're all concerned about energy and the environment well this is a logarithmic graph this represents a smooth doubling every two years of the amount of solar energy we 're creating particularly as we 're now applying nanotechnology a form of information technology to solar panels only eight doublings away from it meeting one hundred percent of our energy needs and there is ten thousand times more sunlight than we need we ultimately will merge with this technology it 's already very close to us when i was a student it was across campus now it 's in our pockets what used to take up a building now fits in our pockets what now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood and we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence as we get closer and closer to this technology based on that we are announcing here at ted in true ted tradition singularity university it 's a new university that 's founded by peter diamandis who is here in the audience and myself it 's backed by nasa and google saying we should devote this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing and if we did that then google would would back this and so that 's what we 've done the last third of the of the nine week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address which is now ubiquitous in the rural areas of china or in africa to bringing health information to developing areas of the world using collaborative interactive communication all the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available and developed online in a collaborative fashion here there are different programs for graduate students for executives at different companies the first six tracks here artificial intelligence advanced computing technologies biotechnology nanotechnology are the different core areas of information technology then we are going to apply them to the other areas like energy"
