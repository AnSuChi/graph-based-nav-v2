  "transcript": "i want to talk to you about my kids now i know everyone thinks that their kid is the most fantastic the most beautiful kid that ever lived but mine really are i have six hundred and ninety six kids and they are the most intelligent inventive brilliant and powerful kids that you 'll ever meet any student i 've had the honor of teaching in my classroom is my kid because their real parents aren 't rich and i argue because they are mostly of color they will seldom get to see in themselves the awesomeness that i see in them what i see in them is myself or what would have been myself i am the daughter of two hardworking parents who chose careers because of this lack of wealth we lived in a neighborhood that luckily however we struck the educational jackpot in a voluntary desegregation program that buses inner city kids black and brown out to suburban schools rich and white at five years old i had to take an bus ride to a faraway place to get a better education i thought everyone went to school and were the only ones using the brown crayons to color in their family portraits while everyone else was using the peach colored ones i started noticing things like how come my neighborhood how come i 'm learning to play the violin while my neighborhood friends don 't even have a music class why were my neighborhood friends learning and reading material that i had done two to three years prior i started to have this unlawful feeling in my belly like i was doing something that i wasn 't supposed to be doing taking something that wasn 't mine but with someone else 's name on it all these amazing things that i was being exposed to and experiencing i felt i wasn 't really supposed to have i wasn 't supposed to have a library fully equipped athletic facilities or safe fields to play in i wasn 't supposed to have theatre departments with seasonal plays and concerts digital visual performing arts i wasn 't supposed to have fully resourced biology or chemistry labs school buses that brought me door to door freshly prepared school lunches or even air conditioning these are things my kids don 't get you see as i got older while i was grateful for this amazing opportunity that i was being given there was this ever present pang of but what about everyone else there are thousands of other kids just like me who deserve this too why doesn 't everyone get this why is a high quality education only exclusive to the rich it was like i had some sort of survivor 's remorse all of my neighborhood friends were experiencing an educational train wreck that i was saved from through a bus ride i was like an educational moses screaming let my people go to high quality schools i 'd seen firsthand how the other half was being treated and educated i 'd seen the educational promised land and i could not for the life of me justify the disparity i know firsthand the tools that were given to me as a student there have been countless nights when i 've cried anger because i don 't have access to the same resources or tools that were used to teach me my kids deserve so much better we sit and we keep banging our heads against this term achievement gap achievement gap is i think we as gloria ladson billings says should flip our paradigm and our language and call it what it really is it 's not an achievement gap an education debt for all of the foregone schooling resources that were never invested in the education of the black and brown child over time little known secret in american history is that the only american institution created specifically for people of color is the american slave trade and some would argue the prison system but that 's another topic for another ted talk the public school system of this country was built bought and paid for using commerce generated from the slave trade and slave labor were enslaved and prohibited from schooling their labor established the very institution from which they were excluded every court case educational policy reform has been an attempt to retrofit the design rather than just stopping and acknowledging we 've had it all wrong from the beginning an oversimplification of american educational history all right just bear with me blacks were kept out you know the whole slavery thing with the help of philanthropic white but while we all know things were indeed separate v the board of education of topeka kansas in one thousand nine legal separation of the races is now illegal but very few people pay attention to all of the court cases since then v board intended some argue that today our schools are now more segregated than they ever were before we tried to desegregate them in the first place teaching my kids about desegregation the little rock nine the civil rights movement is a real awkward moment in my classroom when i have to hear the voice of a child ask if schools were desegregated in are no white kids here they know exactly what 's happening and what 's not they know that when it comes to schooling black lives don 't matter and they never have for years i tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading but whenever i said those dreadful take out a book and read you 'd think i 'd just declared war it was torture after i 'd heard about this website called donorschoose where classroom teachers create wish lists of items they need for their classroom and anonymous donors fulfill them i figured i 'd go out on a limb and just make a wish list of the teenager 's over two hundred brand new books were sent to my room piece by piece every day there were new deliveries and my kids would exclaim with glee the whole experience hit home for me when one of my girls as she peeled open a crisp paperback said ms sumner but to know that a stranger cares this much about me is pretty cool knowing that strangers will take care of you is a privilege my kids aren 't afforded ever since the donation there has been a steady stream of kids signing out books to take home and then returning them with the exclamation but instead they 'd gladly read if the resources were there institutionally speaking our public school system has never done right by the black and brown child we keep focusing on the end results or test results and getting frustrated get to a catastrophe and we wonder how did it get so bad how did we get here really if you neglect a child long enough you no longer have the right to be surprised when things don 't turn out well stop being perplexed or confused or befuddled the incarceration rates rates or whatever socioeconomic disparity is the new it term for the moment the problems we have as a country are the problems we created as a country the quality of your education is directly proportionate to your access to college your access to jobs your access to the future until we live in a world where every kid can get a high quality education no matter where they live or the color of their skin there are things we can do on a macro level school funding should not be decided by property taxes or some funky economic equation where rich kids continue to benefit from state aid senators mayors city council members if we 're going to call public education public education then it should be just that we should call it what it really is poverty insurance public education keeping poor kids poor since believe that education is the great equalizer then it should be just that until then there 's no democracy in our democratic education historically speaking the education of the black and brown child has always depended on the philanthropy of others and unfortunately today it still does if your son or daughter or niece or nephew or neighbor or little timmy down the street goes to an affluent school challenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school or an impoverished classroom close the divide by engaging in communication and relationships that matter if you 're a human being donate money resources opportunities is in your heart there are websites like donorschoose that recognize the disparity and actually want to do something about it what is a carpenter with no tools what is an actress with no stage what is a scientist with no laboratory what is a doctor with no equipment i 'll tell you they 're my kids shouldn 't they be your kids"
