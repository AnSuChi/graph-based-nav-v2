  "transcript": "pitch black outside i flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake because i know that like ripping off band aid it 's better to get it over with quickly i have a friend who yells fire just to rouse her sleeping teen and another who got so fed up that she had to dump cold water on her son 's head just to get him out of bed every morning i ask myself i knowing what i know and doing what i do for a living i 'm a sleep researcher and the consequences of sleep loss i know that i 'm depriving my son of the sleep he desperately needs i also i 'm literally robbing him of his dreams but it 's not just my kid that 's being deprived of now if you 're thinking to yourself phew we 're doing good my kid 's getting eight hours you 're barely passing eight hours is kind of like getting a c on your report card but a major factor preventing teens from getting the sleep they need social lives many schools are starting despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend that middle and high school start no earlier than eight 30am these early start policies have a direct effect on how much or really how little sleep american teenagers are getting they 're also pitting teenagers and their parents in a fundamentally unwinnable fight against their own bodies which determines when we feel most awake and when we feel most sleepy this is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin teenagers ' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around which is two hours later than what we see in adults or younger children this means that waking a teenager up at 6am is the biological equivalent of waking an adult up at the unfortunate days when i have to wake up at 4am i 'm irritable and i probably shouldn 't be driving a car car but this is how many american teenagers feel every single school day irritability laziness depression could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation for many teens battling chronic sleep loss their to compensate is consuming large quantities of caffeine in the form of venti frappuccinos or energy drinks and shots so essentially we 've got an entire population advocates of sleep friendly start times know that adolescence is a period of dramatic brain including reasoning and good judgment in other words the very type of brain activity that 's responsible for reining in those impulsive and often risky behaviors that are so characteristic of adolescence and that are so terrifying to us parents of teenagers they know that like the rest of us when teenagers don 't get the sleep they need their brains their bodies and behaviors suffer they can 't concentrate their attention plummets and many will even show behavioral signs that mimic but the consequences of teen sleep loss go well beyond the classroom sadly contributing to many of the mental health problems that skyrocket during adolescence depression and suicide in our work with teens from la unified school district we found that teens with sleep problems were fifty five percent more likely to have used alcohol in the past month in another study with over thirty there was a thirty eight percent increase in feeling sad or hopeless and if that 's not enough teens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk for a host of physical health problems that plague our country studies have shown that getting five hours or less of sleep per night is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol start times and researchers in this area have produced tremendous science showing the tremendous benefits of later start times i rarely get to speak with that kind of teens from districts with later start times get more sleep to the naysayers who may think that if schools start later teens will just stay up later resulting in more sleep and they 're less likely to drop out not surprisingly standardized test scores in math and reading go up by two to three percentage points one third fewer students or replacing a so so teacher in the classroom with a truly outstanding one i mean who wouldn 't enjoy a little more pleasantness from our teens and a little less crankiness even their communities are safer because car crash rates go down a seventy percent reduction in one district so why have we as a society failed to heed this call often the argument against later start times goes something like this why should we delay start times for teenagers we need to toughen them up so they 're ready for the real world but that 's like saying to the parent of a two year old don 't let johnny nap or he won 't be ready for kindergarten care before or after school these are are the same concerns that come up in district after district and they 're legitimate concerns which is to start middle and high schools no earlier they found that these fears are often unfounded and far outweighed by the tremendous benefits for student health and performance and our collective public safety so tomorrow morning when coincidentally we get to set our clocks back by an hour and you get that delicious extra hour of sleep and a little more full of hope think about the tremendous power of sleep and think about what a gift it would be for our children to be able to wake up naturally in harmony with their own biology"
