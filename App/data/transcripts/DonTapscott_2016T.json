  "transcript": "it 's not robotics it 's called the and that it holds vast promise for every business every society and for all of you individually you know but when it comes to assets it 's really important that i don 't still have the money and that i can 't send it to you this has been called the we rely entirely on big and these intermediaries perform all the business and transaction logic of every kind of commerce from authentication identification of people through to clearing settling and record keeping and overall they do a pretty good job but there are growing problems they 're centralized that means they can be hacked and increasingly are for example people who don 't have enough money to have a they slow things down it can take and they take a big piece of the action they capture our they 've appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically so what if there were not only an internet what if there were an internet of value and where every kind of asset from money to music could be stored moved transacted exchanged and managed all without powerful intermediaries what if there were a native medium for value well in two thousand and eight the financial industry crashed and perhaps an anonymous person or persons named satoshi nakamoto created a paper where he developed a protocol for a digital cash and this seemingly simple act set off a spark that now don 't be confused about bitcoin bitcoin is an asset it goes up and down it 's a cryptocurrency it 's not a fiat currency controlled by but the real pony here is the underlying technology it 's called blockchain so for the first time now in human history people everywhere can trust each other and transact peer to peer and trust is established not by some big institution and because trust is native to the technology i call this the trust protocol now you 're probably wondering how does this thing work fair enough assets digital assets like money to music and everything in between using the highest level of cryptography it 's posted globally across millions and millions of computers and out there around the world is a group of people called miners these are not young people they 're bitcoin miners they have massive computing power at their fingertips ten to one hundred times bigger than all of google worldwide and every ten minutes kind of like the heartbeat of a network a block gets created trying to and every one is so if i wanted to go and and hack a block and say pay you and you with the same money i 'd have to hack that block plus all the preceding blocks the entire history of commerce on that not just on one computer but across millions of computers all using the highest levels of encryption in the light of the most powerful computing resource in the world that 's watching me tough to do this is infinitely more secure than the computer systems that we have today blockchain that 's how it works so the bitcoin blockchain is just one there are many the ethereum blockchain was developed by a canadian named and this blockchain has some extraordinary capabilities one of them is that you can build smart contracts it 's kind of what it sounds like it 's a contract and the contract handles the enforcement the management performance and payment the contract kind of has a bank account too in a sense of agreements between people and today on the there are projects underway to do everything from create a new replacement for the stock market to create a new model of democracy where politicians are accountable to citizens so to understand what a radical change this is going to bring let 's look at one industry financial services recognize this rube goldberg machine well it kind of reminds me of the financial services industry honestly i mean you tap your card in the corner store and a bitstream goes through a dozen companies each with their own computer system so wall street and all around the world the financial industry is in a big upheaval about this wondering can we be replaced or how do we embrace this technology for success let me describe some applications the first era of the internet the internet of information brought us wealth and this is at the heart of all of the the anger and extremism and protectionism and xenophobia and worse that we 're seeing growing in the world today brexit being the most recent case so could we develop some new approaches to this problem of inequality because the the only approach today is to redistribute wealth tax people and spread it around more could we let me describe five ways that this can be done number one did you know that seventy percent of the people in the world who have land have a tenuous title to a little farm in honduras some dictator comes to power he says i know you 've got a piece of paper that says you own your farm but the government computer says my friend owns your farm and this problem exists everywhere hernando de soto the great latin american economist says this is the number one issue in the world in terms of economic mobility more important than having a you can 't hack it this creates the conditions for prosperity for potentially billions of people secondly lot of writers talk about uber and airbnb and taskrabbit and lyft and so on as part of the sharing economy this is a very powerful idea that peers can come together and create and share wealth my view is that these companies are not they 're successful precisely because they don 't share they aggregate services together and they sell them what if rather than airbnb being a $ twenty five billion corporation there was a distributed application on a blockchain we 'll call it and they go onto the blockchain database and all the criteria they sift through it helps them find the right room and and it even handles reputation because if she so disruptors in silicon valley number three this is the global diaspora people have left and it 's growing and these people are getting ripped off analie domingo is a housekeeper and every month she goes to the western union office with some cash to send her remittances to her mom mom in manila it costs her around ten percent the money takes four to seven days to get there her mom never knows when it 's going to arrive it takes five hours out of her week to do this six months ago analie domingo used a blockchain application called and then her mom looked at her mobile device it 's kind of like an uber interface tellers moving around she clicks on a teller that 's a seven minutes away the guy shows up at the door gives her filipino pesos she puts them in her wallet number the most powerful asset of the digital age is data and data is really a new asset class maybe bigger than previous asset classes like land under the agrarian economy or an industrial plant or even money and we leave this trail of digital crumbs behind us as we go throughout and these crumbs are collected into a mirror image of you the virtual you so today there are companies working to create an identity in a black box the virtual you owned by you and this black box moves around with you and it 's very very stingy it only gives away the shred of information that 's required to do something a lot of transactions finally finally number five there are a whole number take music musicians are left with crumbs at the end of the whole food chain you know if you were a songwriter twenty five years ago you wrote a a hit you could get royalties of around forty five thousand dollars today you 're a songwriter you write a hit song it gets a million streams you don 't get surrounding it you want to put the song in your movie that 's and because the song has a payment system in the sense of bank account all the money flows back to the rather than these powerful intermediaries it 's any creator and with they 're going to be able to make it rain on the blockchain and that 's a wonderful thing so these are five opportunities out of a dozen to solve create prosperity of course people do but my case to you is that once again and it 's giving us another kick at the can another opportunity to rewrite the economic power grid and the old order of things and solve some of the world 's most difficult problems if we will it"
