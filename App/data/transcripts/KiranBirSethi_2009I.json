  "transcript": "is a good word even in the times of h1n1 i like the word laughter is contagious passion is contagious but for me was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something i call the i can bug so the question is why only them in a country of a billion people and some why so few is it luck is it chance can we all not systematically and consciously get infected the next eight minutes i would like to share with you my story i got infected when i was seventeen challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me and how contagious that feeling was i also realized i should have got infected when i was seven when i started riverside school ten years ago it became a lab a lab to prototype and refine a design process and i uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context that if you blur the boundaries between school and life then children go through a journey of aware where they can see the change but this was all common sense so i 'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at riverside they were made to roll and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world that child labor just had to be abolished and look at ragav that moment when his face changes because he 's been able to understand that he has shifted that man 's mindset and that can 't happen in a classroom i am doing it and that 's the i can mindshift and it is a process that can be energized and nurtured but what about math and science and english show us the grades and we did the data was conclusive when children are empowered not only do they do as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over two thousand schools in india riverside children were outperforming the top ten schools in india in math english and science so on august 15th independence day two thousand and seven the children of riverside set out to infect and basically said when are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child when will you include the child in the city basically open your hearts and your minds to the child so how did the city respond since two thousand and seven every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood here was a city telling its child you can a glimpse of infection in ahmedabad they are doing street plays city gives to the children in the future the children will give back to the city kbs so on august 15th again independence day two thousand and nine empowered with the same process we empowered one hundred and reached thirty two thousand schools anything that bothers you choose one week and they did stories of change poured in from all over india from nagaland in the east to jhunjhunu in the west from sikkim in the north to krishnagiri in the south it was incredible basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in rally and a street play in a rural school unheard of it was a revelation for me it was a revelation doesn 't strike me that they had so much it was incredible so how can we still stay immune how can we stay immune to that passion that energy that excitement seventy years ago it took one man to infect an entire with the power of we can"
