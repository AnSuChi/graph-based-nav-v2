  "transcript": "i guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s when i was then after every episode i had to go up to the bathtub and swim around bathtub and look at the drain because that 's all there was to look at and by the time i turned sixteen i pursued a career in marine science in brian skerry took this shot thanks brian and i 've dived operated by the japanese government and sylvia earle and i were on an expedition in this submarine twenty years ago in japan and on my dive i went down eighteen thousand feet to an area that i thought would be but when i got there i found lots of plastic garbage and so i began to work with national geographic society and others and led expeditions where we explored that big iceberg b 15 the largest iceberg in history that broke off and we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around so that and that same year ten years ago i headed north to the phoenix islands and i 'm going to tell you that story here in a moment but before i do i just want you to ponder this graph for a moment and it 's about twelve percent and you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the kind of a nice trajectory right now and that 's probably because that 's when everybody got aware of the environment and but the ocean protected area is basically flat line until right about now it appears to be ticking up and i do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean i think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like and we can 't see what 's going on and therefore we 're way behind on protection but scuba diving submersibles and all the work that we 're setting about to do here they were the world area up until last week when the chagos archipelago was declared it 's in the mid pacific it 's about five days from anywhere if you want to get to the phoenix islands it 's out in the middle of the pacific right around the equator i had never heard of the islands ten years ago nor the country kiribati that owns them till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in fiji said greg would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands they 've never been but tell me where they are and the country that owns them so that 's when i first learned of the islands and had no idea what i was getting into but i was in for the adventure let me give you a little peek here of the phoenix islands protected area the average depths are about twelve thousand ft there 's lots of seamounts in the phoenix islands which are specifically part of the protected area seamounts are so it 's a deep think about it in a big three dimensional space very deep three dimensional space with herds of tuna all kinds of deep sea marine life like we 've seen here before that 's the vessel that and they 're all uninhabited except one island has about thirty five caretakers on it and they 've been uninhabited for most of time because even in the ancient days these islands were too far away from the bright lights of fiji and hawaii and and tahiti for those ancient polynesian mariners that were traversing the pacific so widely let 's try there both my personal and my professional life changed suddenly i saw a world that i had never seen before in the ocean schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface manta rays you can see the fish are balled up and then there 's a little cloudy area there where they 're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity the phoenix islands and and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here phoenix islands is a major tuna location and sharks we had so i and we and and that 's the the area again you can see the islands there are eight islands that pop out of the water where do these exist well they exist in the republic of kiribati and kiribati is located in the central pacific in three island groups in the west we have the gilbert islands and they have about one hundred and ten thousand people they control three point four million cubic and when i was first going up there i barely knew the name of this country ten years ago and people would ask me willy why do you rob banks and he says cause that 's where all the money is and i would tell people why do because that 's where all the ocean is they basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the central pacific ocean they 're also a country that is in dire danger and kiribati along with forty two other nations in the world will be under water within fifty to one hundred years due to climate change and the associated rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean the islands rise only and these nations are faced with a real problem we as a world are faced with a problem what do we do with displaced fellow the president of the maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently but back to the phoenix islands which is the subject of this talk started contacting them because they had actually given me a permit to do this and i said i want to come up and tell you what we found and for some reason they didn 't want me to come or it was hard to find a time and a place and it took a while but finally they said okay you can come but if you come you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar so i said okay i 'm happy to buy lunch just get whatever anybody wants so and we presented for two hours on the amazing findings of the phoenix islands and the country never after the talk the minister of fisheries do you realize that you are the first scientist who has ever come back and told us what they did he said we often issue these permits to do research in our waters but or a and are you free for dinner and over the course of dinner i learned that kiribati gains most of its revenue it 's a very poor country but it gains what revenue is has by selling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters because kiribati does not have the capacity to take the fish itself and the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives kiribati five percent of the landed value so if the united states removes a million dollars ' worth of so i asked the minister over over dinner i said would you consider a situation where you would still get paid and the sharks and the shrimp in the water he stopped and he said yes we would like to do that and i think we would call it a reverse fishing license he coined the term reverse fishing license so i said license ' so we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point i went back to the states and started looking around to see if i could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued and it turned out there were none there were no oceanic deals where countries were compensated for not fishing it had occurred on land in rainforests of south america and africa where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down and conservation international had struck some of those deals so i went to conservation international and brought them in as a partner and and went through the process of valuing the fishery resource deciding how much kiribati should be what the range of the fishes were brought in a whole bunch of other partners the government of australia the and we basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment president anote tong he 's a really important leader a there 's two things i 'd like you to do one is remember i 'm a politician so you 've got to go out and work with my ministers and convince the people of kiribati that this is a good idea i don 't want to do something like this if it 's going to go away after i 'm voted out of office so we had very strong leadership very good vision and a lot of science a lot of lawyers involved many many steps were taken and it was primarily because kiribati realized that this was in their own self interest to do this they realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community then coral bleaching event happened in the phoenix here 's this resource that we 're looking to save and it turns out it 's the hottest heating event that we can find on record the ocean heated up as it does sometimes and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the phoenix islands for six months it was over thirty two degrees celsius for six months and it basically killed sixty percent of the coral so suddenly we had this area that we were protecting but now it it appeared to be dead at least in the coral areas of course the deep sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine but the coral which everybody likes to look at was in trouble the good news is it 's recovered and recovering fast faster than any reef we 've seen this picture was just taken by brian skerry a few months ago when we returned to the phoenix islands and discovered that because it is a protected area and has healthy fish populations that keep the algae grazed down and keep the rest of the reef healthy the coral is booming is just booming back and that 's the story 's the only threat the only influence that the reef had to deal with there was no fishing there was no pollution there was no coastal development and the reef is on a full bore recovery now i remember that dinner i had with the minister of fisheries ten years ago when we first brought this up and i got quite animated during the dinner and said well i think that the but the devil will be in the details and it certainly was the last ten years have been detail after detail ranging from creating legislation to multiple research expeditions to communication plans mous creating the phoenix islands trust board and we are now in the process of raising the full endowment kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state up and running entity that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country for this so it 's a very solid very well thought out very well grounded that was very important with this work from the bottom up to to secure this so the conditions for success here are listed you can read them yourselves but i would say the most important one in my mind and that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self interest of kiribati as well as the self interest of the world and i 'll leave you with one final slide that is how do we scale this up how do we realize sylvia 's dream where eventually do we take this here 's the pacific with large mpas and large conservation zones on it and as you can see we have a patchwork but every other green patch on that has its own story and what we need to do now is look at the whole pacific ocean in its entirety and make a network of mpas across the pacific so that we have our world 's largest ocean protected
