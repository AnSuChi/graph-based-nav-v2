  "transcript": "it involves the design of cities and the design of city streets streets are some of the most valuable resources that a city has and yet it 's an asset that 's largely this is important because we live in an urban age for the first time in and that if we 're going to continue to grow and thrive and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure this is a picture of times square in the this is times square in two thousand and eight not much has changed in those fifty years so we worked hard to refocus our agenda to maximize efficient mobility providing more room for buses more room for bikes more room for people to enjoy the city and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them having goals is important because if you you need to know where you 're going and why it 's expected that you shelter in place and it misses all the other ways that a street is used and we found that new york city was largely a city without seats pictures like this people perched on a fire hydrant not the mark of a world class city so we worked hard to change that and probably the best example of our new approach is in times square it was dangerous hard to cross the street we closed broadway from 42nd street to 47th street and the temporary important part of the program because we were able to show we would keep it and if it didn 't work no harm no foul we could put it back the way that it was because these were temporary materials and that was a very big part of the but the results were overwhelming it 's been a total home run times square is now one of the top ten retail locations on the planet and this is an important lesson because it doesn 't need to be a zero sum game between moving traffic and creating public space every project has its surprises and one of the big surprises with times square was how quickly people flocked to the space we put out the orange barrels and people just materialized immediately into the street it was like a star trek episode you know they weren 't there before and then zzzzzt where and we put those lawn chairs out on the street and the lawn chairs became the talk of the town it was about those lawn what did you think about the lawn chairs do you like the color of the lawn chairs so if you 've got a big controversial project think about lawn chairs beautiful pavers that have studs in them to reflect the light from the billboards creating a great new energy on the and we think it 's going to really create a great place a new crossroads of the world that is worthy of its name and we will be cutting the ribbon on this the first phase this december with all of our projects our public space projects we work closely with local businesses and local merchant groups who maintain the spaces move the furniture take care of the plants and they were a big supporter of this new approach because they understood that more people and you can see the short leg that was there used for cars that 's not really needed so what we did is we painted over the street put down epoxy gravel and connected the triangle to the storefronts on grand avenue created a great new public space and it 's been great for businesses along grand avenue pretty dingy looking parking lot and used some paint and planters to transform it over a weekend we 've moved very very quickly with paint and temporary materials instead of waiting through years of planning studies and the proof is not in a computer model it is in the you can have fun with paint we 've repurposed twenty six acres of active car lanes and turned them into new pedestrian space i think one of the successes is in its emulation you 're seeing this kind of approach since we 've painted times square you 've seen this approach in boston in chicago in san francisco in mexico city buenos aires you name it this is actually in los angeles and they actually copied even the green dots that we had on the streets but i can 't underscore enough how much more quickly this enables you to move over traditional construction methods and in six years turned cycling into a real transportation option in new york i think it 's fair to say it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike and now new york has become one of the cycling capitals you can see the map in two thousand and seven this is how it looked in i love this because it looks so easy you just click it we also brought new designs to the street we created the first bike lane in the united states we and it 's been great bike volumes have spiked injuries to all users pedestrians cyclists drivers are all down fifty percent and we 've built thirty miles of these protected bike lanes and now you 're seeing them pop up all over the country soaring the green line is the number of bike lanes and the yellow line is the number of injuries which has remained essentially flat and so there is something to that axiom that there is safety in numbers not everybody liked the new bike and there was a lawsuit and and somewhat of a media frenzy a couple years ago one brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on prospect park west the most contested piece of land outside of the gaza strip and this is what we had done see that the people were far ahead of the press far ahead of the politicians in fact i think most politicians would be happy to have those kind of poll numbers since we 've launched the program three and so with this little blue key you can unlock the keys to the city and this brand new transportation option and daily usage just continues to soar what has happened is the average daily ridership on the streets of new the bikes are being used six times a day and i think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets in the past it looked like the guy on the left and you can walk across town faster than you can take the bus and so we focused on you pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus we 've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane and it 's been a huge success i think one of my very favorite moments and i was riding citi bike up first avenue in my protected bike lane and i looked over and i saw pedestrians standing safely on the pedestrian islands and the traffic was flowing birds were singing the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes and so you just need to reimagine your streets they 're hidden in plain sight"
