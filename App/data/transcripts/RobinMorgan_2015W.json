  "transcript": "i fell in love with poetry with the rhythms and the music of language with the power of metaphor and of imagery poetry being the essence of communication the discipline the distillation and all these years later the poems i 'll read today are from my just finished seventh book of poetry well five years ago i was diagnosed with parkinson 's disease advances in treatment are really impressive but you can imagine that i was appalled to learn that women are largely left out of research trials gender specific medical findings having demonstrated that we are not actually just small men who happen to have different reproductive systems gender specific medicine is good for men too but you bring to a crisis the person you already are including the yes momentum that you 've learned to invoke through passionate caring and through action both of which require but also create so as an activist i began working with the parkinson 's disease foundation that to create a major initiative to put women on the parkinson 's disease sometimes even joyful i do not feel diminished by parkinson 's i feel distilled by it and i actually very much like the woman i 'm distilling into no signs of struggle growing small requires enormity of will just sitting still in the doctor 's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out rare is an exchange a smile of brief wry recognition you everyone here was you once acceptance of irritating help from those who love you giving way and over but not up floors and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands it demands colossal patience all this growing small your diminished sleep at night your handwriting your voice your height you are more the incredible shrinking woman than the buddhist mystic serene making do with less less is not always yet in this emptying space space glimmers becoming visible here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed by what some would call diminishment it is a place of merciless poetry a gift of presence previously ignored drowned in the daily clutter here every gesture needs intention is alive with consciousness nothing is automatic you can spot it in the provocation of a button feats of such modest valor who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware such understated power here in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant such quiet beauty here in these there is immensity required in growing small so bent on such unbending grace kidneys corneas liver lungs tissue heart veins whatever odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research maybe saving someone else from what it is they 're not quite sure i have drill through the answers find what i 'm trying to tell you uncover what i 'd hint at if i could track the clues this was a good brain while alive this was a brain that paid i want to be used i want to be used i want to be used up lit from within and light from our most lucent selves our tragedy is we can 't see it we see by reflecting to show our true colors huge galaxy clusters can act as background images of star systems to faint arcs a lensing effect like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine a glass of wine or two now makes me weave as if acting the drunkard 's part as if besotted with unrequited love for the dynamic turner canvasses spied out by the i could lurch down a city street set without provoking every pedestrian walk on stare walking even standing is illogical such tiny things feet especially when one 's body is not al dente anymore and excess i 've always thought apollo beautiful but boring and a bit of a dumb blonde dionysians don 't do balance has never been my strong point but i digress more and more these days digression seems the most direct route through from where i 've lost or found myself out of place mind turn time place your foot just so mind how you turn too swift a swivel can bring you down take your time ushering the audience out saying goodbye to the actors the ghost light is what they call the single bulb hanging above the bare stage in an empty theater waking to meet no external radiance this is the final struggle left to win this the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in and let the rest begin this the lens through which at last to see both self and other arrayed with the bright stain of original sin lit from within is the last one this dark hour late summer four a m dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden 's careful on the slick slate slabs i need no light i know the way breathing in the wet green this is the small still hour shrills the computer screen blinks and glares awake poem in my head soil in my hand unnamable fullness this hour when blood of my blood bone of bone child grown to manhood now not distant but apart lies safe off dreaming melodies in his arms immeasurable lightness the density of black starts to blur objects emerge trailing shadows night ages toward day gaudy noons there was this hour should those who loved me grieve too long a while let them remember that i had this hour this dark and smile"
