  "transcript": "data that we have to deal with in medical and this is our beast of burden this is a computer tomography machine a ct machine it 's a fantastic device it uses it takes about thirty seconds to go through the whole machine so this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care but as i said it 's also a challenge for us and let me step back in time let 's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then these machines that came out they started coming in the 1970s and i 've taken the liberty just for clarity to translate that to data which is small and that would correspond to about twenty gigabytes of data or eight hundred phone books and the pile would then be two hundred meters of phone books what 's about to happen and just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds and that would correspond to one terabyte of data so this is really the enormous challenge that we have and already today this is twenty five thousand images they would put up so this is really what we 're doing so this gigabyte or terabyte of data we 're putting it into this and this is a challenge this is a huge challenge for us to do that using computers even though they 're getting faster and better it 's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data terabytes of data i want to look at the liver maybe even find a tumor in some cases this is as of nine a m this morning she 's playing a computer game she 's only two years old so she 's really the driving force behind the development of graphics processing units so what 's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that i 'm doing with the medical data and you know going back maybe it was cabinets of processors and storage and everything i paid about one million dollars for that machine so every month there are new graphics cards coming out and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors and you know for a few hundred bucks you can get these so this is really what 's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine so i 'm going to show you a few examples you can see that this is a full data [ set ] it 's a woman you can see the hair you can see the individual structures of the woman you can see that there is [ a ] scattering of x rays on the teeth the metal in the teeth that 's where those artifacts are coming from but fully interactively on standard graphics so i can start rotating i can look at it from different angles and i can see that this woman had a problem she had a bleeding up in the brain and just by changing the functions then i can decide what 's going to be transparent i can look at and that 's where they went in so these are fantastic images they 're really high resolution and they 're really showing us what we can do with with standard graphics cards today now we have really made use of this and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data and one of the applications that we 've been working on and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide is the application of virtual autopsies so again looking at very very large data sets and you saw those full body scans that we can do we 're just pushing the body through the whole ct scanner and you can see how i 'm gradually peeling off first you saw the body bag that the body came in then i 'm peeling off the skin you can see the muscles and eventually you can see the bone structure now at this point i would also like to emphasize that with the greatest respect for the people that i 'm now going to show i 'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies so it 's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that i 'm showing these pictures to you in the forensic case and this is something that there 's been approximately four hundred cases so far just in the part of sweden that i come from so in the morning in between six and seven in the and then the radiologist together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist looks at the data that 's coming out and they have a joint session and then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that now looking at a few cases here 's one of the first cases that we had you can really see the our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details so she 's quite badly beaten up by this here 's another case it 's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body you can also see some of the artifacts from from the teeth that 's actually the filling of the teeth but because i 've set the functions to show me metal and make everything but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs it 's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part which is difficult to do in a normal the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was here 's another case that i think is interesting here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine on this person if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments that 's actually quite hard to do one of the things that i 'm really really happy it 's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms using standard graphics gpus it actually looks like this just to give you a feeling for what it looks like it really just works like a huge iphone so we 've implemented all the gestures you can do on on the table so if you were thinking of buying an ipad forget about it this is what you want instead steve i hope you 're listening to this all right so it 's a very nice little device so if you have the opportunity please try it out it 's really and we 're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes but also perhaps in the future in a more clinical let me move on to really so what you 're seeing on the left is it 's a little mechanical pen that has very very fast step motors inside of the pen and i get a feedback and all of a sudden i feel resistance and then i can so just looking at this heart and this is karljohan one of my graduate students who 's been working on this project and he 's sitting there in front of the haptic and he 's moving his pen and the heart is now beating in front of him so he can see how the heart is beating he and he 's putting it on the heart and then he feels the heartbeats and really feel how the valves are moving and this i think is really the for heart surgeons i mean it 's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to to go inside of the patient 's heart before you actually do surgery and do that with high quality resolution data now we 're going and we heard a little bit about functional mri now mri is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain or any part of the body so what we 're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that 's oxygenated and blood that 's depleted of oxygen that means that it 's possible to map out and he was wearing goggles so motts is doing something here and probably he is going like this with his right hand because the left side is is activated on the motor cortex and then he can see that at the same time this is another sequence of motts ' brain and here we asked motts to calculate backwards from one hundred so he 's going one hundred and you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain well this is fantastic we can do this in real time we can investigate things we can tell him to do things you can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head because that 's where he 's seeing he 's seeing his own brain and he 's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things so he 's going like this so we 've got motor cortex activation up there this is really really nice and i think this is a great tool and connecting also with the previous talk here now we 're also having a bit of fun at the center so this is a cat scan so this is a lion from the local zoo outside of norrkoping in kolmarden so she came to the center and i can peel off the layer of the lion i can look inside of it and we 've been experimenting with this and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology because there 's very we can scan all sorts of things all sorts of animals the only problem is to fit it into the machine so here 's a bear the nose of the bear so with that i 'd like to to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images writing all the software so some very talented people my motto is always i only hire people that are smarter than i am and most of these are smarter than i am so thank you very much"
