  "transcript": "a crazy evangelical i 've always known that the age of design is upon us almost like a rapture or i go to a show and i see a beautiful piece by an artist particularly beautiful because he clearly looked to design to understand what he needed to do so i really do believe that design is the highest form of creative expression that 's why i 'm talking to you today about the age of design and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture is still posters is still fast you see at moma today but in truth what i really would like to where a robot deposits a slur of recycled refrigerator parts as if he were a big or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time and that become part of our identity i want people to understand and it 's interesting how so much of what we 're talking about tonight is not simply design but interaction design and in interaction design is what i 've been trying to insert in the collection of the museum of modern art for a few years starting not very timidly but just toshio iwai 's maeda 's reactive books and also but more recently i 've been trying really to go even deeper into interaction design with examples that are emotionally really suggestive and that really explain interaction design at a level that is almost undeniable it looks at the territory of the united states as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what 's going on with the winds in the and that 's where all hell broke loose in a really interesting way laughter there are still people that believe that there 's a high and there 's a low and that 's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we 've had to the we 've no first of all new york magazine always gets it i love them so we are in the right quadrant we are in the highbrow that 's daring that 's courageous and brilliant which is great timidly we 've been higher on the diagonal in other situations but it 's okay it 's good but here comes the art critic oh that was fantastic so the first was jonathan jones from the guardian i was talking about interaction design excuse me alongside picasso and van gogh they 're two floors away will mean game over for any real understanding of art it 's coming and jonathan jones is making it happen so the same guardian or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to aspire to would like to be called artists no designers aspire to be really great designers thank you very much and that 's more than enough so my knight in shining armor john maeda without any prompt came out with this big declaration on why video games belong in the moma and that was but then there was another wonderfully pretentious article that came out in the new republic so pretentious by liel leibovitz and it said moma has and here look no video games aren 't art because they are quite thoroughly something else code so it 's so fantastic to see how these feathers that were ruffled and you know what the international cat video film festival didn 't have that much of a reaction i think this was truly fantastic we were talking about dancing ponies but i was really jealous of the walker arts center for putting up this festival because it 's very very wonderful and there 's this flaubert quote i have always tried to live in an ivory tower but a tide of shit is beating at its walls threatening to undermine it i consider myself the tide of shit you know we have to go through that and it will happen in the future but right the amount of work and alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed and it 's fantastic so behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work because we 're still the museum of modern art so even when we tackle popular culture we tackle it as a form of interaction design and as something that has to go into the to be researched so to get to and it 's mostly myself and kate carmody we worked on it for a year and a half so many people helped us designers of games we were not real gamers enough so we had to really talk to them and so we decided of course to have sim city two thousand not the other sim city that one in particular so the criteria that we developed along the way were really strong and were not only criteria of selection they were also criteria of exhibition and of that 's what makes this acquisition more than a little game or a little joke it 's truly a way to think of how to preserve and show artifacts that will more and more become we live today as you know very well not in the digital not in the physical but in the kind of minestrone that our mind makes of the two and that 's really where interaction which are in a way the purest form of interaction unadulterated i also talk about the metrocard vending machine which i consider a masterpiece of interaction i mean that interface is beautiful it looks like a burly mta guy coming out of the tunnel you and i talk about how bad i try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with the sims not only the fun but also the that came with the tamagotchi it 's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can first video games in which you could choose your own music so you would put into the you would put your own cd and then the game would change alongside your music so really fantastic not to mention eve online eve online is an artificial but one of the diplomats that was killed in benghazi not ambassador stevens but one of his collaborators was a really big shot in eve online so here you have a diplomat in the real world that spends his time in eve online to kind of test maybe all of his ideas about diplomacy and about universe building and i was just recently at the dwarf fortress is like the holy grail of this kind of massive multiplayer online game and in fact the two adams brothers were in reykjavk and they were greeted by a standing ovation by all the eve online fans it was amazing to see and it 's a beautiful so you start seeing here that the aesthetics that are so important to a museum collection like moma 's are kept alive also by the selection of these games portal is an example of a video game in which you have a certain type of violence which also leads me to talk about but when i came to moma nineteen years ago and as an italian i said you know what we need a beretta and i was told no no guns in the design collection and i was like why i learned that it 's considered that in if it 's in the art collection it might be a critique of the killing instrument so it 's very interesting but we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design so maybe one day we 'll be able to acquire also the guns but here in this particular case we decided you know with kate and paul that we would have no gratuitous we have portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces we have street fighter ii because martial arts are good but we don 't have gta because maybe it 's my own reflection i 've never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps so it was not very constructive and to this day i am ambivalent but it 's about serenity and it 's about sublime it 's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature and right now we started with the first fourteen but we have several that are coming up and the reason why we haven 't acquired them yet is because you don 't acquire just the game you acquire the relationship with the company what we but that 's what would enable us to preserve the video games for a really long time and that 's what museums do they also preserve artifacts for posterity companies are not very forthcoming in some cases but i want to explain to you the the criteria that we chose for interaction design aesthetics are really important and i 'm showing you core war here which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically of the limitations of the processor so the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor 's limitedness which is fantastic so aesthetics is always important and so is space the spatial aspect of games you know i feel that the best video games are the ones that have really savvy architects that are behind and if they 're not architects bona fide trained in architecture they have that feeling but the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important time the way we experience time in video games as in other forms of interaction design is really quite amazing it can be real time or it can be the time within the game as is in animal crossing where seasons follow each other at their own pace so time space designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives they 're not just limited to our interaction with the screen in this case i 'm showing you marble madness which is a beautiful game in which the the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you so you have a sphere that 's moving in this landscape and the sphere the controller itself gives you a sense of the movement in a way you can see how video games are the purest aspect of interaction design and are very useful to explain what interaction is no arcade nostalgia if anything we want to show the code and here you see ben fry 's distellamap of pac man of the pac man the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox you see them here furniture and other parts but but interestingly this choice was not condemned too vehemently by gamers i was afraid that they would kill us and instead they understood especially when i told them that i was trying to apply the same stratagem that philip johnson applied in when he wanted to make people understand the importance of design and he took propeller blades and pieces of machinery and in the moma galleries he put them on white pedestals against white walls as if they were brancusi sculptures he created this strange distance this shock that made people realize how gorgeous formally and also important functionally design pieces were i would like to do the same with video games by getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts and everything else that we might remember from our childhood i want people to understand that those are important forms of design and in a way the video games the fonts and everything else lead us to to make people understand a wider meaning for design one of my dream acquisitions which has been on hold for a few years but now will come back on the front burner is a seven hundred and forty seven i would i don 't want it to be at moma and possessed by moma i to keep flying so it 's an acquisition where moma makes and the same with the @ sign that we acquired a few years ago it was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain and what i say to people it 's almost as if a butterfly were flying by and we captured the shadow on the wall and just we 're showing the shadow so in a way we 're showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part along the way i 've had to burn a few chairs you know i 've had to do away with a few concepts of design past but i see that people are coming along that the audiences paradoxically are much more responsive and much more understanding of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are design is truly everywhere and design is as important as anything and i 'm so glad that because of its diversity and because of its centrality to our lives many more thank you very much"
