  "transcript": "i 'm doing here and i paint on paper using gouache which hasn 't changed in six hundred years but about three years ago i had an art show in new york and i titled it serious nonsense so i think i 'm actually the first one here i lead i called i use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when i and it 's very kind of staid and this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors and this is a you can probably tell frank gehry and i come from the same town my work is so personal and so strange that i have to invent my own lexicon for it and i work a lot in what i call retrofuturism which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow and the peak time for that was the 30s because the depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future and technology this is popular workbench popular science magazines in those days i had a huge collection of them from the ' all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at three hundred miles an hour it 's all going to happen it 's all going to be wonderful automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject this is where i cut my teeth is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened for good reason usually the zeppelin this was from a brochure about the zeppelin but the zeppelin was fifty six people at the speed of a buick and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the normandie to fly it wasn 't you know it was inevitable it was going to go this jousting in malibu in the 30s the technologically of the 20th century by the way you needed to know that the flying car which never got off the ground it was a post war dream this is pitched into the future from one thousand nine hundred and forty six looking at the day all american families have them there 's moscow shirley hope they speak esperanto faux nostalgia which i 'm sort of not say famous for but i work an awful lot in it it 's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion this is emblematic of it this is wing dining recalling those balmy summer days you can 't see it very well here but that 's hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody i do a lot of that and authenticity is a is a major part of my serious nonsense i think it and they had a canary hung inside the thing to happy little story isn 't it this is motor ritz towers in manhattan in the 30s where you drove up to your front door if you had the guts this is those wonderful days of the battle of britain in one thousand nine hundred and forty when bursts into the house of commons and buzzes around just to piss off churchill who 's down there somewhere it 's a fond memory of times past hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit just for the fun of it this was a piece i did a brochure again rms the biggest thing in all the world the copy which you can 't see because it goes on and on for several pages says that and it 's so safe it carries no insurance i think this will wake you up it has no just desoto discovers the mississippi and it 's a desoto i did that as a quick and i did that and i thought well i 'm ashamed i hope nobody knows it people wrote in for reprints of that thing i try to make life in new york look even weirder than it is with those covers i 've done about forty of them and i 'd say thirty of them are are based on that concept i was driving down 7th avenue one night at three a m and this steam pouring out of the street and i thought what causes that and that whos to say the temple of dendur at the metropolitan in york it 's a very somber place i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it this is a very un pc cover and i got a nasty email from some environmental group saying this is too serious and solemn to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize got around to it yet but this is the word side of my brain i love the word eurotrash this was the new york bike messenger meeting the tour de france if you live in new york you know how the except that he 's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff they all do and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the tour de france this is the only fashion cover i 've ever done it 's the little old lady that lives in a shoe and then this thing the title of that was there goes the neighborhood i don 't know and then i got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying don 't put a strap on it this is a tiny people always ask me where do you get your ideas how do your ideas come about that one is i had a horrible red wine hangover in the middle of the night this came to me like a xerox all i had to do was write it down mrs edgar rosenberg her former name was fay wray and so that was i didn 't have the and it 's in three parts you can 't see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move"
