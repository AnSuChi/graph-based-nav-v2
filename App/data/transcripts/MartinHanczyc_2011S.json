  "transcript": "so historically so we go from say this beautiful and complex crystal this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side over the last hundred and fifty years or so science has kind of blurred this distinction between non living and living systems and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists but what we 're going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non living end of this spectrum so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living really what i 'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life life also has a metabolism now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself life also has a kind of inheritable information now we as humans we store our information as dna in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring if we couple the first two the body and the metabolism we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate and if we coupled these now to inheritable information we can come up with a system that would be more lifelike and would perhaps evolve and so these are the things we will try to do in the lab that have one or more of these characteristics of life so how do we do this well we use a model system that we term a protocell you might think of this as kind of like a primitive cell it is a simple chemical model of a living cell and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together play together in a complex network to produce something that we call considering a kind of synthetic biology the synthesis of life should it ever occur will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea that 's his first statement so actually create life in the laboratories it 's probably not going to impact our lives at all we use this idea called self assembly what that means is i can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab and these these chemicals will start to and in this particular example what i took is some membrane molecules mixed those together in the right environment and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here these membranes are also quite similar morphologically and functionally to the membranes in your body and we can use these as they say to form the body of our protocell likewise we can work with oil and water systems as you know when you put oil and water together they don 't mix but through self assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form and we can actually use this so that 's just forming some so we came up with this protocell model here that i 'm showing chemically active it could run a metabolism on it certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay for example in this case rna shown in red it 's an informational molecule it can come along and it starts to associate this structure then can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself and that 's shown in green here on this micrograph so we 're on a road towards but if you saw this protocell you would not confuse once it forms it doesn 't really do anything so something is missing some things are missing so some things that are missing is for example so we came up with a different protocell model and this is actually simpler than the previous one okay oil droplet forms through self assembly and we put it in another experiment get it moving then i 'm going to add some food so i add some food source to the system the protocell moves it encounters the food it reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there alright so not only do we have this system that has a body it has a metabolism it can use energy it moves around it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself now this doesn 't have a brain it doesn 't have a neural system this is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior if we count the number of chemicals in that system actually including the water that 's in the dish we have five chemicals we have some protocells on the but we also have basically population level behavior similar to what organisms have so now that you 're all experts we 're going to play a game with these protocells we 're going to make two different kinds protocell a has a certain kind of chemistry inside that when activated the protocell starts to vibrate around just dancing so remember these are primitive things so dancing protocells that 's very interesting to us the second protocell has a different chemistry inside and when activated the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one we just put these two together in the same system so there 's population a and the other protocell just dances around and this just happens until and protocell a and protocell b fused together to form a hybrid protocell ab that didn 't happen before there it goes there protocell ab likes to dance around for a bit while but then something even more interesting happens watch when these two large protocells the hybrid ones fuse together now we have a dancing protocell right just with blobs of chemicals again so the and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior which in this case is replication interesting colors and interesting behaviors perhaps these represent an easily accessible step one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth but they wouldn 't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and and i showed in these experiments rather they 'd be a real complex mixture of all kinds of stuff and it 's a pool that 's too difficult to fully characterize even by modern methods and the product looks brown like this tar here on the left for contrast if you let that go unregulated you 'll continue to make and break chemical bonds forming an even more diverse so we 're able to then organic black tar and we put them into one of these experiments as you 've seen earlier and then we watch lively movement that comes out they look really good very nice movement and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other working with just primordial conditions no pure chemicals these are also these tar fueled protocells are also able to locate and you can see they really like that they become very energetic and able to find the resource in the environment similar to what we saw before but again these are done in these primordial conditions really messy conditions not sort of sterile laboratory conditions these are very dirty little protocells as a matter of fact but they have lifelike properties is the point so doing these artificial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non living and living systems and not only that but it helps us broaden our view of what life is and what possible life there could be out there life that could be very different from life and that leads me to the next this is used in reference to a report in two thousand and seven by the national research council in the united states wherein they tried to understand if we went to another planet and we thought there might be there how could we even recognize it as life well they came up with three very general criteria first is and they 're listed here the first is the system has to be that means the system cannot be dead in a matter of fact driving photosynthesis driving the ecosystem without the sun there 's likely to be no life on this planet then this is not a good place for life we need to be able to make and break chemical bonds and again this is important because life transforms resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain possible life there could be out there"
