  "transcript": "i work with a bunch of mathematicians philosophers and computer scientists and we sit around and think about the future of machine intelligence among other things some people think that some of these things are sort of science fiction y far out there let 's look at the modern human condition laughter this is the normal way for things to be but if we think about it we are actually recently arrived guests on this planet the human species another way to look at this is to think of world gdp over the last ten thousand years i 've actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph it looks like this it i sure wouldn 't want to sit on it now it 's true technology has accumulated through human history technology advances extremely rapidly but i like to think back further to the ultimate cause we have kanzi he 's mastered two hundred lexical tokens and ed witten unleashed the second superstring revolution it maybe also a few tricks in the exact way it 's wired these invisible differences cannot be too complicated however because there have only been two hundred and fifty thousand generations since our last common ancestor we know that complicated mechanisms take a long time to evolve so so this then seems pretty obvious that everything we 've achieved and everything we care about depends crucially and the corollary of course is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially enormous consequences some of my colleagues think we 're on the verge of something that could cause a profound change in that substrate and that is machine artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box you would have human programmers that would painstakingly handcraft knowledge items you build up these expert systems and they were kind of useful for some purposes basically you got out only what you put in but so rather than basically the same thing that the human infant does or learn to play any computer game on the atari console now of course a i is still nowhere near having the same powerful ability to learn and plan as a human being has the cortex still has some algorithmic tricks that we don 't yet know how to match in machines so the question is how far are we from being able to match those tricks a couple of years ago we did a survey of some of the world 's leading a i experts to see what they think and one of the questions we asked was by which year do you think there is a fifty percent probability that we will have achieved we defined human level here as the ability to perform almost any job at least as well as an adult human so real human level not just within some limited domain and the median answer was now it could happen much much later or sooner the truth is nobody really knows what we do know is that the ultimate limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside the limits in biological tissue this comes down to physics but even a present day transistor operates at the gigahertz tops but in computers signals can travel at the speed of light there are also so the potential for lies dormant in matter much like the power of the atom lay dormant throughout human history patiently waiting there until one thousand nine hundred and forty five in this century scientists may learn to and i think we might then see an intelligence explosion now most people when they think about so at one end we have the village idiot but i think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence the true picture is actually probably more like this after many many years of really hard work maybe eventually we get to artificial intelligence something that can navigate cluttered after many many more years of really hard work lots of investment maybe eventually we get to the train doesn 't stop at it 's likely rather to swoosh right by particularly when it comes to questions of power the fate of kanzi and his depends a lot more on what we humans do than on what the chimpanzees do themselves once there is superintelligence the fate of humanity may depend on what the think about it machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make machines will then be better at inventing than we are and they 'll be doing so on digital timescales what this means is basically a telescoping of the future think of all the crazy space colonization nanobots or uploading of minds into computers all kinds of science fiction y stuff that 's nevertheless consistent with the laws of physics all of this now a superintelligence with such technological maturity would be extremely powerful it would be able to get what it wants we would then have a future that would be shaped by the preferences of this a i now a good question is what are those preferences here it gets trickier to make any headway with this we must first of all avoid anthropomorphizing and this is ironic because every newspaper article about the future of a i has a picture of this we need to think of intelligence as an optimization process a process that steers the future into a particular set of configurations a superintelligence is a really strong optimization process it 's extremely good at using available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized this means that there is no necessary connection between being highly intelligent in this sense suppose we give an the goal to make humans smile when the a i becomes superintelligent it realizes that there is a more effective way to achieve this goal take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to another example suppose we give a i the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem when the a i becomes superintelligent it realizes that the most effective way to get the solution to this problem and notice that this gives the a i s an instrumental reason to do things to us that we might not approve of human beings in this model are threats we could prevent the mathematical problem from being solved but the general point here is important if you create a really powerful optimization process to maximize for objective x you better make sure that your definition of x incorporates everything you care about this is a lesson that 's also taught in many a myth king midas but as an illustration of what happens if you create a powerful optimization process and give it misconceived or poorly specified goals if a computer starts sticking electrodes into people 's faces we 'd just shut it off a this is not necessarily so easy to do if we 've grown dependent on the system like where is the off switch to the internet we have an off switch for example right here but so could a superintelligent agent and it would be much better at that than we are the point is we should not be confident that we have this under control here and we could try to make our job a little bit easier by say putting the a i in a box but how confident can we be that a i couldn 't find a bug given that merely human hackers find bugs all the time i 'd say probably not very confident but again like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps i 'm sure there is some employee out there somewhere who has been talked into handing out her account details by somebody claiming to be from the i t department more creative scenarios are also possible like if you 're the a i you can and then when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you they look at the source code bam the manipulation can take place a i the point here is that we should not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligent genie locked up in its bottle forever sooner or later will out i believe that the answer here is to figure out how to create superintelligent a i such that even if when it escapes it is still safe because it is fundamentally on our side because it shares our values i see no way around this difficult problem now i 'm actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved we wouldn 't have to we would create an a i and its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that it predicts we would approve of we would thus leverage its intelligence as much as possible to solve the problem of value loading but it doesn 't happen the initial conditions for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to the values that the a i has need to match ours not just in the a i might encounter in the indefinite future and there are also some sorted out the exact details of its decision theory how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth so the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult not as difficult as making a but fairly difficult making that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that the risk is that if somebody figures out so i think that now it might be that we cannot solve the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements can only be put in place once you know the details of but the more of the control problem the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well this to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing and i can imagine that if that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right thank"
