  "transcript": "to please recall a time when you really loved something a movie an album a song or a book and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked and you anticipated that reaction you waited for it and it came back and the person hated it way of introduction that is the exact same state in which i spent every working day of the last six years i sell a product to a market that doesn 't want it but is forced by law to buy it i mean it so there 's there 's a useful stereotype about students that i see a useful stereotype about you all i could give you guys an and i would expect no higher than a twenty five percent pass rate and both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the u s today to start with i 'd like to break math down into two categories one is computation this is the stuff you 've forgotten for example factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one this stuff is also really easy to relearn provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning math reasoning we 'll call it the the application of math processes to the world around us so i 'd like to talk about why that is why that 's can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher one is a lack of initiative your students don 't self start you finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re explain the entire thing at their desks students lack perseverance they lack retention you find yourself and then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation this is really destructive creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows has a really good description for this he swore off creating contemporary drama shows set in the present day because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of for example men no disrespect it shapes the neural pathways he said in such a way that they expect simple problems he called it an impatience with irresolution you 're impatient with things that don 't resolve quickly you expect and i 'll put it to all of what you already know that no problem worth solving is that simple i am very concerned about this because i 'm going to retire in a world that my students will run i 'm doing bad things to my own future and well being when i teach this way i 'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks particularly mass adopted textbooks it 's functionally equivalent to turning on two and a half men and calling it a day first of all here that you have exactly three pieces of information there each of which will figure into a formula somewhere eventually which the student will then compute i believe in real life and ask yourself what problem have you solved ever that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance where you didn 't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out sufficient information and had to go find some i 'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that i think knows how it 's hamstringing students because watch this this is the practice problem set when it comes time to do the actual problem set we have problems like this right here where and if the student still doesn 't recognize the stamp this was molded from it helpfully explains problem you can return to to find the formula you could literally i mean this pass this particular unit without knowing any physics just knowing how to decode a textbook that 's so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math here 's a really cool problem i like this it 's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift but what you have here is actually four separate layers and i 'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and how when they 're compressed together and presented to the student all at once how that creates this impatient problem solving i you have the visual so i hope you can see i really hope you can see how what we 're doing here is taking a compelling straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way that 's all we 're doing here so i want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students we can have everything we 're looking for in terms of patient problem solving so right here i start with the and this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers so you get people arguing against each other friend versus friend and then and only then we throw down that mathematical structure the math serves the conversation the conversation doesn 't serve the math and at that point i 'll put it to you that nine out of ten classes are good to go on the whole slope steepness but if you need to your students can then develop those substeps together it 's been obvious in my practice to me and i 'll yield the floor here for a second to einstein who i believe has paid his dues we just give problems to students we don 't involve them in the formulation of the problem so ninety percent of what i with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving does does the color of the valve matter what matters here such an underrepresented question in math curriculum in textbooks we go out and we take a picture of it and then even better is we take a video a video of someone filling it up and they 're all wondering at some point how you know you 've baited the hook right and that question off this right here is really fun for me because like the intro i teach kids because of my inexperience i teach the kids and i 've got kids who will not join a conversation about math because every student is on a level playing field of intuition attach them to guesses and the best part here or one of the better parts is that we don 't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher 's edition we instead just watch the end of the movie that 's great but it 's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical but those conversations have been so valuable among the these are the kids who and they 'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year which is just so fun 're no longer averse to word problems because we 've redefined what a word problem is i encourage math teachers i talk to to use multimedia because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color to encourage student intuition for that level playing field to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation to let students build the problem because einstein said so and to finally in total just be less helpful because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways it 's buying you out of your obligation for patient problem solving and math reasoning and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous i put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got six thousand views in two weeks i get emails still from from teachers in countries i 've never visited saying wow yeah we had a good conversation about that oh and by the way here 's how i made your stuff better i put this problem on my blog recently in a grocery store which line do you get into the one that has one cart and nineteen items and the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom which is just bizarre right patient problem solving"
