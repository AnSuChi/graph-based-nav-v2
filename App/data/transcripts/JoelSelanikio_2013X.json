  "transcript": "and he comes across a guy under a street lamp who 's looking at the ground and moving from side to side and the cop asks him so the cop takes his time and looks over and kind of makes a little matrix and looks for about hey buddy are you sure you lost your keys here but the light is better here there 's a concept that people talk about nowadays called big data and what they 're talking about is all of the information that we 're generating through our interaction with and over the internet i can tell you that working in global health that is not so we don 't know for example how many people right now are being affected by disasters or by conflict situations we don 't know for really basically any of the clinics in the developing which ones have medicines and which ones don 't we have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics we don 't know and this is really amazing to me we we don 't know how many children were born or how many children there are in bolivia or botswana or bhutan we don 't know the needs of the elderly the mentally ill for all of these different critically important problems or critically important areas that we want to solve we basically know nothing at all and part of the reason why we don 't know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems this is about a 5 000 year old technology some of you may have used it before it 's kind of on its way out now but we still use it for ninety nine percent of our stuff and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months knocking on the doors and like to ask you some questions do you have any children were your children vaccinated because the only way we can actually find out how many children were vaccinated in the country of indonesia what percentage were vaccinated is actually not on the internet but by going out and knocking on doors sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this you know a census of indonesia would probably take two years to accomplish and the problem of course with all of this blood supplies all these different paper forms a truckful of data this is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey in a single district in the country of zambia from a few years ago that i participated in collected on paper over which is something like a county in the united states you can imagine that for the entire country of zambia answering just that single question looks something like this truck after truck after truck filled with stack after stack after stack of data because once you 've collected all that data of course someone some unfortunate person is going to have to type that into a computer when i was a graduate student i probably made a lot of mistakes when i did it that no one ever discovered so data quality goes down hopefully then you can take the results of that data collection and use it to vaccinate children better because if there 's vaccine preventable diseases and the fact is millions is a is a gross estimate because we don 't really know how many kids die each year of this what makes it even more frustrating is that you probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on fuel and photocopying and per diem diem and then for some reason momentum is lost or there 's no money left and all of that comes to nothing because no one actually types it into the computer at all the process just stops happens all the time this is what we base our decisions on in global health no data i began to think about ways in which we could improve this process now one thousand nine hundred and ninety five obviously that was quite a long time ago it kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was the top movie of the year was die hard with a vengeance as you can see bruce willis had a lot more hair back then i was working in the centers for disease control and but to me the most significant thing that i saw in the ultimate elite mobile device and when i saw the palmpilot for the first time i thought why can 't we put the forms on these palmpilots and go out into the field just carrying one palmpilot which can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of working at i began to travel to different programs around the world and to train them in using it worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted digital data collection is actually more efficient than collecting on paper rose was out doing similar stuff for the american red cross the problem was after a few years of doing that i realized i had been to maybe six or seven programs the demand for the need for data to run better programs just within health not to mention all of the other fields in developing countries is enormous there are millions and millions and millions of programs millions of clinics that need to track drugs millions of vaccine programs there are schools that need to track attendance there are all these different things for us to get the data that we need to do and i realized if i kept up kept up the way that i was doing i was basically hardly going to make any impact and so i began to rack my brain trying to think about what was the process that i was doing how was i training folks and what were the bottlenecks and what were the the obstacles to doing it faster and to doing it more efficiently and unfortunately after thinking about this for some time i identified the main obstacle and the main obstacle it turned out and this is a sad realization the main obstacle was so what do i mean by that i had developed a process whereby i was the center of the universe of this technology then you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country so you could be talking about 20 or thirty thousand dollars if i actually had the time or it fit my schedule and i wasn 't on vacation the point is that anything any system that depends on a single human being or two or three or five human beings it just doesn 't scale and so i began to think of ways in which i could basically take myself out of the picture and you know i was thinking how could i take myself out of the picture for quite some time flying from countries that look pretty much like this to other countries with people with darker skin you spend time and you spend per diem and you spend for a hotel and all that stuff but the miracle that happened i 'm going to call it hotmail for short but for me it was miraculous because i noticed just as i was wrestling with this problem sub saharan african health worker that i was working with and it struck me wait a minute i know the the hotmail people surely didn 't fly to the ministry of health in kenya so these guys are distributing technology getting software capacity out there but they 're not actually flying around the world to think about this more while i was thinking about it people started using even more things like this just as we were they started using linkedin and flickr and gmail and google maps all these things they don 't require consultants because the business model for all these businesses and so i thought instead of training people how to put so we created software called magpi which has an online form and it doesn 't have to be a smartphone it can be a basic phone like the phone on the right the basic symbian phone that 's very common in developing countries and the great part about this is it 's just like hotmail but there are some additional benefits as well now we knew when we built this system the whole point of it just like with the palmpilots was that you 'd be able we can take a process that took two years and compress that down and i told you that in the first few years of trying to do this the old fashioned way going out to each country we probably trained about one thousand people what happened after we did this in the second three years we had fourteen thousand people find the website canadian pig farmers tracking pig disease and pig herds people tracking drug supplies one of my favorite examples the irc international rescue committee they have a program where semi literate midwives using $ ten mobile phones send a text message using our software once a week with the number of births and the number of deaths which gives irc something that no one in global health has ever had a physicians for human rights this is moving a little bit so that they can bring the perpetrators to justice camfed another charity based out of the uk camfed pays girls ' families to keep them in school the turnaround time between a teacher writing down grades or attendance and getting that into a report was about two to three years now it 's real time and because the whole cost combined is ten thousand dollars a year just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation so we 've made a lot of progress but i recognize that right now even the work that we 've done with fourteen thousand people using this but something 's changed and i think it should be obvious what 's changed now we 've created a tool that lets programs track the number of babies that are born and the number of babies that prosecute them to do all these different things to learn more about what 's going on to understand more to see more"
