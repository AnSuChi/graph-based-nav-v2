  "transcript": "and i so i asked everybody in my life what they thought i turned to my grandmother who always had and most importantly true love will find you i 'm somebody who thinks a lot about i am constantly swimming in numbers formulas and charts so i 'm at the end of this bad breakup i 'm thirty years old i figure i 'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months before i 'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of so that wasn 't going to work if my strategy was to least expect my way into true love then the variable that i had to deal with was serendipity in short i was trying to figure out what 's the probability of my finding mr right well and i figured so again i started doing some math population of philadelphia it has one point five million people i figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to seven hundred and fifty thousand i 'm looking for a guy between the ages of thirty and thirty six which was only four percent of the population so now i 'm dealing with the possibility of thirty thousand men i was looking for somebody who was jewish because and that was important to me that 's only two point three percent of the population i figure i 'm attracted to maybe one out of ten of those men and there was no way i was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer so that basically meant there were thirty five men for me that i could possibly date in the entire city of in the meantime my very large jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children and i felt like i was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already so i have two possible strategies at this point i 'm sort of figuring out one i can take my grandmother 's advice and sort of my way into maybe bumping into the one city of philadelphia or i could try online dating and that 's really just a simple way of saying i 've got a problem i 'm going to use some data run it through a system and get to a solution so online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other but as it turns out algorithms have been around for thousands of years in fact in judaism there were matchmakers a long time ago and though they didn 't have an explicit algorithm per se they definitely were running through formulas in their heads like is the girl going to like the boy are the families going to get along what 's the rabbi going to say are they going to start having children right away so in my case i thought will data so i decided to sign on now there was one small catch as i 'm signing on to the various dating websites the biggest problem is that i hate filling out questionnaires of any kind so i just copied and pasted from my rsum i said that i was an award winning journalist and a future thinker when i was asked about fun activities and my ideal date i said monetization but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date these algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates what turned out to be truly awful dates there was this guy the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets we share a love of math and data so steve the i t guy invited me out to one of philadelphia 's white table cloth extremely expensive restaurants and we went in and right off the bat our conversation really wasn 't taking flight but he was ordering a lot of food in fact he didn 't even bother looking at the menu he was ordering multiple appetizers multiple and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table also lots and lots of bottles of wine so we 're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner and i 've decided steve the i t guy and i are really just not meant for each other but we 'll part ways as friends when he gets up to go to the bathroom the bill comes to i 'm a modern woman i am totally down with with splitting the bill but then steve the i t guy didn 't come back and that was my entire month 's rent audience i call my sister and as i do at the end of each one of these terrible you 're just being too picky so i said fine from here on out i 'm only going on dates where i know there 's wi fi and i 'm bringing my laptop i 'm and i 'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically these dates really are terrible started tracking things like really stupid awkward sexual remarks bad vocabulary the number of times a man forced me to high five him so as it turns out some reason men who drink scotch reference kinky sex immediately well and as it happens the algorithms that were setting us up which was to take our see the real problem here is that while the algorithms work just fine you and i don 't when confronted with blank windows where we 're supposed to input our information online the other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like are you a dog person or a cat person i 'm not looking for a pen pal i 'm looking for a husband right i 've got a new plan i 'm going to keep using these online dating sites but i 'm going to treat them as databases and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up i think i 'm going to try so knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people so i started writing and writing and writing i wanted somebody was jew ish so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture but wasn 't going to force me to go to shul every i wanted somebody who worked hard the hobbies that i have are really just new work projects that i 've launched so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it i also wanted somebody who would weigh twenty pounds more than me at all times regardless of what i weighed which to be so what i did was i went through and i prioritized that list i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points and i ranked everything starting at one hundred and going all the way down to ninety one and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points these things were also important to me but not because what i wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not i thought the guy that i found online would be a match with me i figured there would be a minimum of seven hundred points before i would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message and i wouldn 't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the one thousand five hundred point threshold so i go back online now i found done it i 've cracked the code i have just found the jewish prince charming as teacher she said she is silly nice and friendly she likes to make people laugh alot so i created ten fake male profiles now before i lose all of you i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that i really really wanted to marry so i didn 't reach out to any woman first just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract the voice the communication style that these women shared in common i wanted to figure out how to maximize my own i had content matters a lot so smart people tend to write a lot three thousand four thousand five thousand words about which may all be very very interesting the challenge here though is that the popular men and women are sticking to ninety seven words on average even though it may not seem like it all the time so in my case the english patient is my most favorite movie ever but it doesn 't work to use that in a profile because that 's a superficial data point and somebody may disagree and decide they don 't want to go out because they didn 't like sitting through the three hour movie also optimistic language matters a lot so this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women words like fun and girl and love and what i realized was not that i had to dumb down my own profile remember i 'm somebody who said that i speak fluent and i know javascript and i was okay with that the difference is that it 's about being more approachable and and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you and as it turns out timing is also really really important just because you have access to somebody 's mobile phone number or their instant message account and it 's two o 'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake doesn 't mean that that 's a good time to to communicate with those people the popular women on on these online sites spend an average of twenty three hours in between each communication and finally there were the photos all of the women who were popular showed some skin which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what i had uploaded as it turns out telling them about this fabulous news and they say this is wonderful how soon are you going out i said actually i 'm not going to go out with anybody because remember in my scoring system they have to reach a minimum threshold of seven hundred points and none of them have done that they said what you 're still being too damn picky well not too long after that i found this guy which i thought was very clever he talked in detail about travel he made a lot of really interesting cultural references he looked and talked exactly like what i wanted and immediately he scored eight hundred and fifty points it was enough for a date three weeks later we met up in person for that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant and when he dropped me back off at my house that night i re scored him [ one thousand and fifty points ] thought you know what this entire time i haven 't been picky enough well a year and a half after that we were non cruise ship traveling when he got down on his knee and year after that we were married and about a year and a half after that our daughter petra was born audience oh [ what it means obviously i 'm having a fabulous life so in fact it 's something that you write yourself so whether you 're looking for a husband or a wife or you 're trying to find your passion or you 're trying to start a business all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules and feel free to be as picky as you want well on my wedding day i had a conversation again with my grandmother and she said all right maybe i was wrong it looks like you did come up with a really really great system they should be fluffy not hard and i 'll take her advice on"
