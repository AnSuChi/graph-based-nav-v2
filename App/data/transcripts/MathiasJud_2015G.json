  "transcript": "we were invited by the swiss embassy in berlin to present our art projects but this invitation really thrilled us the swiss embassy in berlin is special it is the only old building in the government district that was not destroyed during the second world war and it sits right next to the federal chancellery no one is closer to chancellor merkel than the swiss diplomats the government district in berlin also contains the reichstag germany 's parliament and the brandenburg gate and right next to the gate there are other embassies in particular the us and the british citizens are limited in their constitutional rights in its government district the right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there and this is interesting from an artistic point of view the opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order order and always subject to a specific regulation with an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations we can gain a new perspective the given terms and conditions shape our perception our actions and our lives and this is crucial in another including the mobile phone of angela merkel the antennas of the british gchq are hidden in a white cylindrical radome while the listening post of the american nsa is covered by radio transparent and we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation if people are spying on us it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying we installed a series of antennas they weren 't as sophisticated as those used by the americans and the british they were makeshift can antennas not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible and so we built another large antenna never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation a helicopter circled over our heads with a camera registering each and every move we made although the government district is governed by a strict police order there are no specific laws relating relating to digital communication our installation was therefore perfectly legal and the swiss ambassador informed chancellor merkel about it we named the project can you hear me laughter the antennas created an open and free wi fi communication network in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate using any without any hindrance and be able to send messages to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted file sharing anything could be sent anonymously and people did communicate over fifteen thousand messages were sent this is the nsa in god we trust all others we track the embassies and the government departments to participate in the open network and to our surprise they did even for members of a parliament we also organized guided tours to experience and sound out if we become aware of the constellation the terms and conditions of communication it not only broadens our horizon it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview it 's not poverty not racism not exclusion that are new what is new is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange such makeshift settlements are considered illegal and therefore those living in them don 't have a chance of making their voices heard merely gives grounds for further persecution expulsion and suppression what interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side we were searching for an interface we named the project hotel gelem together with roma families we created several hotel gelems in europe for example in freiburg in germany in montreuil near paris but they aren 't a commercial enterprise they are a symbol you can go online working and living with the roma families here the roma families are not the travelers the visitors are the roma families are not a minority the visitors are the point is but rather to find out about the context that determines these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions but at the same time the gap between the world of the privileged and the world of the excluded is growing but asylum seekers who arrive by boat in australia are deported or taken to prison the interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system are veiled by the australian authorities these procedures are declared to be secret military operations we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned despite strict screening and from these contexts was born an installation in the art space of the queensland university of technology in brisbane it was a very simple installation on the floor a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility but the exhibition step above every floor marking there was a headset visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee who was or had been imprisoned in a specific detention facility and engage in a personal conversation in the protected context of the art exhibition asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves their story without fear of consequences visitors immersed themselves in long conversations about families torn apart about dramatic escapes from war zones about suicide attempts about the fate of children in detention it was a powerful experience europe is now facing the situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation but they are significant information on the internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being censored and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized this brings us back to our network and to the antennas on the roof of the swiss embassy in berlin we should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected we should start making our own connections fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world this is essential to overcome our it is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion thank you me just a detail the name of the hotel is not a random name gelem means something specific in the roma language you two traveled to the island of lesbos very recently you 're just back a couple of days ago in greece where thousands of refugees are arriving and have been arriving over the last few months what did you see there and what did you do there christoph wachter and during our stay many asylum seekers arrived by boat on and after landing they are denied many services for example they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket or to rent a hotel room so many families because i think i believe it 's not only that we have to speak about the refugees i think we need to start talking to them christoph thank you for coming to"
