  "transcript": "that i learned it when i was four at my mother 's knee that year she introduced me to dance since then it 's been four decades now and wove a rich tapestry of artistry achievement and awards the crowning glory was in two thousand and seven when i received this country 's fourth highest civilian award the padma shri for my contribution to art nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the and grades were what i got in school as a dancer i know the nine rasas or the navarasas disgust humor i learned what fear was overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control i shed copious tears and asked my dear husband jayant i said is this it is this the end of the road is this the end of my dance and he the positive soul that he is this is just a hiatus a hiatus during the treatment and you 'll get back to doing what you do best i realized then my thought my mind the images that these thoughts created and the action that derived from it so here i was wanting to go to a place of healing health and happiness i wanted to go from where i was to where i wanted to be for which i needed something i needed something that would pull me out of all this so i dried my tears and i will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life i also declared to the world at large that i would ride it out and i would not allow cancer to ride me a peg to peg to peg this process on so that i could go how do you keep cheer how do you not despair when climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture how do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all all i wanted to do was curl up and weep but i kept telling myself fear and tears are options i did not have would drag myself into my dance studio body mind and spirit every day into my dance studio and learn but i did it i focused on my on the imagery of my dance on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself i moved out of that miserable state of mind and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four the metaphor of mahishasura resplendent bedecked beautiful her eighteen arms ready for warfare as she rode astride her lion durga the epitome of creative feminine energy or shakti i made that image of durga and her every attribute her every nuance my very own powered by the symbology of a myth laser sharp focus into my dance laser sharp focus to such an extent that i i danced through chemo and radiation cycles much to the dismay of my oncologist i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule what i had done is i had tuned out of cancer yes cancer has just been one page in my life my story is a story of overcoming setbacks obstacles my story is the power of choice it 's the power of focus it 's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you so moves you that something even like cancer durga the fearless one she was also called simhanandini the one who rode the lion as i ride my own inner strength my own inner resilience as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer asking my rogue cells to behave i present to you an excerpt of that work the the the the the that the that"
