  "transcript": "thing to do but let 's kick off the afternoon with a message from a mystery sponsor ladies and gentlemen a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in two they have a sense of humor these guys hacked into fox news ' twitter account to announce president you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom at fox what do we do now put on a black armband or crack open the champagne and of course who could escape the irony of a member of rupert murdoch 's news corp being a victim of hacking for a change you turn on the news and you say is there anyone left to hack sony playstation network the cia falling off a log in fact a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world those that know they 've been hacked and those that i mean anyway this mysterious group anonymous and they would say this themselves they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data they say that governments are trying to take over the internet and control it and that they anonymous are the authentic voice of resistance be it against middle eastern dictatorships against global media corporations or against intelligence agencies or whoever it is okay they 're a little internet and very soon it will mediate most human activity old age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom now this is a very complicated struggle and unfortunately for mortals like you and me we probably can 't understand it very well nonetheless in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago i decided i would try and do that and i sort i sort of get it these were the various things that i was looking at as i was trying to understand it but in order to try and explain the whole thing and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the internet one way or the other but in a configuration that and so i thought to myself well these are the guys who i want to talk to and what do you know as it were so despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions hundreds of billions of dollars into cybersecurity for the most extraordinary technical solutions no one wants to talk to these guys the hackers who are we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in turin italy called the hackers profiling project doing some fantastic research into the characteristics into the abilities and the socialization of hackers but because they 're a u n operation but i think they 're doing very important work because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry we have so far i 've mentioned the hackers but what about the well real organized crime on the internet goes back about ten years when a group of gifted ukrainian hackers which led to the industrialization of cybercrime welcome to the now forgotten realm of carderplanet this is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the net now carderplanet was very interesting cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details to exchange information about new malware that was was out there and remember this is a time when which you can deploy even if you 're not a terribly sophisticated hacker and so carderplanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals and its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals and that challenge is how do you do business how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that they 're a criminal it 's axiomatic that they 're dodgy and they 're going to want to try and rip you off so the family as the inner core of carderplanet was known came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system they appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser the vendor say had stolen credit card details the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them the purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details and the officer would then verify if and if they did he then passed on the money money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser and it was this which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the web and after that it just went wild we had a champagne decade for people who we know as carders now i spoke to one of these carders and he explained to me how in two thousand and three and two thousand and four he would go on sprees in new york taking out $ ten thousand from an atm here $ thirty thousand from an he said that he sort of understood the technology and he realized that security was very important if you going to be but he didn 't spend his days and nights bent over a computer eating pizza and this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise they 're the most vulnerable element of all and i want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who i met while i was doing this research dimitry golubov aka script born in odessa ukraine in now he developed his social and moral compass on environment where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities was entirely necessary if you wanted to survive as an accomplished computer and he did a great job in the only environment he knew was gangsterism he knew no other way of making a living and making money born in colombo sri lanka as an eight year old he and his parents fled the sri lankan capital because singhalese mobs were roaming the city looking for tamils like renu to murder at eleven he was interrogated by the sri lankan military accused of being a terrorist and his parents sent him on his own to britain as a refugee seeking political asylum at thirteen with only little english and being bullied at school but he was soon being seduced by people and he will be released from wormwood scrubs jail in london in two thousand and twelve born in southern germany to a stable and well respected middle class family his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated his slide into criminality max vision aka iceman mastermind of cardersmarket born max vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of santa clara california in the late 90s for private companies and voluntarily for the fbi now in the late 1990s he discovered a vulnerability on all u s government and he went in and patched it up because this included nuclear research facilities he left a tiny digital and he was convicted at his open prison he came under the influence and this man with a brain is now serving a he impressed in the private sector developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until he combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal one of the smartest people encountered amongst global cybercriminals now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come from very different environments they are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid teens remember that when they developed those hacking skills their moral compass had not yet developed and most of them with the exception of script and they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world only on the web and the other thing is is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are now i discussed this with professor simon baron cohen who 's the professor of developmental psychopathology at cambridge and he has done path breaking work on autism and confirmed also for the authorities here that gary mckinnon who is wanted by the united states for hacking into the pentagon suffers from asperger asperger 's and a secondary condition of depression and baron cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities because i don 't think people like max vision should be in jail and let me be blunt about this in china in russia and in loads of other countries that are developing capabilities this is exactly what they are doing they are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities are mobilizing them on behalf of the state and if we rely as we do at the moment we will be nurturing a monster we cannot so your idea worth spreading is hire hackers how would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole mg i think to an extent have to understand that it 's axiomatic among hackers that they do that they have all said please please we just never knew how to get there what we were doing we want to work with you"
