  "transcript": "evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form teacher to pupil storyteller to audience whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the internet human beings have always told their histories and truths but where unmediated by our own furious consumerism what moral code are we imparting to our young cinema is arguably the 20th century 's most influential art form its artists told stories across national boundaries in as many languages genres and philosophies as one can imagine indeed it is hard to find a subject that film during the last decade we 've seen a vast integration of global media now dominated by a culture of the hollywood blockbuster we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation not story is king what was common to us all forty years ago the telling of stories between generations is now rarified as a filmmaker it worried me as a human being it puts the fear of god in me what future could the young build with so little grasp of where they 've come from and so few narratives of what 's possible the irony is palpable technical access has never been greater cultural access never weaker and so in two thousand and six we set up filmclub an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions if we could raid the annals of one hundred years of film maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young given the access to technology even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a dvd onto a white board in the first nine months we ran twenty five clubs across the u k with kids in age groups between five and eighteen watching a film uninterrupted for ninety minutes and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind new perspectives by the time the pilot had finished we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join poverty and aspiration technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema find and pay for the print and the projectionist but for my father the emotional and artistic importance of de sica 's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half century with his three teenage children and thirty of their friends in order he said to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation slum dwellers float skyward on flying brooms sixty years after the film was made and thirty years after i first saw it i see young faces tilt up in awe their incredulity matching mine and the speed with which they associate it with slumdog millionaire or the favelas in rio speaks to the enduring nature in a filmclub season about democracy and government we screened mr smith goes the film is older than most of our members ' grandparents frank capra 's classic values independence and propriety it shows how to do right how to be heroically awkward it is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor shortly after mr smith became a filmclub classic in the house of lords and it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle after all jimmy stewart filibustered for two entire reels in choosing hotel rwanda they explored genocide of the most brutal kind it provoked tears as well as incisive as they watch more films their lives got palpably richer pickpocket started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement but railed against our restless school system that does not value unlike that offered by sidney poitier 's careful tutelage by now these thoughtful opinionated curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms black and white subtitled documentary non narrative fantasy and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week from twenty five clubs we became hundreds then thousands until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in seven thousand clubs right across the country and although the numbers were and continue to be extraordinary what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning others with their teachers or with their friends and those without friends started making them the films provided communality across all manner of divide and the stories they held provided a shared brought a daughter closer to her iranian mother and jaws became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he 'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey who was right who wrong what would they do under the same conditions was the tale told well was there a hidden message how has the world changed how could it be different a tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn 't think were interested and they themselves had not known they cared rather than seeing the films as artifacts they began to see themselves i have an aunt quite recently she told me that in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to israel without my grandparents it was these teenagers i was past forty when my father died he never mentioned that journey my mother 's mother left europe in a hurry without her husband but with her three year old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt and his story was hushed as he assimilated story i had anne frank the great escape shoah triumph of the will it was leni riefenstahl in her elegant nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure these films held what was too hurtful to say out and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt 's wrist or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth but within the reels lie purpose and meaning as one 12 year old said after watching wizard of oz every person should watch this because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart we honor reading why not honor watching with the same passion each a piece of memorable art each a brick in the wall of who we are and it 's okay if we remember tom hanks better than astronaut jim lovell or have ben kingsley 's face eve harrington howard beale mildred pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as shakespeare is in illuminating the world of elizabethan england we guessed that film whose stories are a meeting place of drama music literature and human experience would engage and inspire the young people participating in filmclub what we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior confidence and academic achievement students now race to school talk to their teachers fight not on the playground but to choose next week 's film young people who have found ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young they are neither feral nor myopically we appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered if we want different values we have to tell a different story a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person 's identity that a collective narrative is an essential because when these people get home after a screening of rear window and raise their gaze to the building next door they have the tools to wonder who apart from them is out there and what is their story"
