  "transcript": "so you go to the doctor and get some tests the doctor determines that you have high cholesterol and you would benefit the company that you have a little more of a conversation with your physician and the physician is a little worried because you 've been blue haven 't felt like yourself you haven 't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do your physician says you have some depression i 'm going to have to give you another pill so now we 're talking about two medications this pill also millions of people have taken it the the fda looked at it all good wait a minute how much have we studied it 's very hard to do that in fact it 's not traditionally done we totally depend on what we call after the drugs hit the market ask your favorite person who has several diagnoses how many medications they 're on i 'm an informatics and data science guy and really in my opinion the only hope only hope to understand these interactions is to leverage lots of different sources of data in order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely and when it 's not so safe let 's call him because that 's his name nick was a young student i said you know nick we have to understand how drugs work and how and how they work together and how they work separately and we don 't have a great understanding patients doctors companies pharmacists and these reports are pretty simple it has all the diseases that the patient has so i said let 's see if we can understand glucose response i sent nick off nick came back russ he said i 've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not he did it it was very simple in a way he took all the drugs that were known to change glucose and a bunch of drugs that don 't change glucose and said what 's the difference in their side effects differences in fatigue in appetite in urination habits all those things conspired to give him a really good predictor he said russ i can predict with ninety three percent accuracy when a drug will change glucose i said nick that 's great he 's a young it 's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose because it 's core to our practice good job but not really that interesting definitely not publishable he said i know russ i thought you might say that nick is smart i thought you might say that so i did one other experiment i looked at people in this database who were on two drugs and i looked for signals similar where each drug alone but together i saw a strong signal and but what caught my eye was on the list there were two drugs or paxil an antidepressant and i said huh and a million we estimated on both so that 's a million people who might be having some problems with their glucose if this machine learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the standard of proof evidence that we have so we have to do something else let 's go into the stanford electronic medical record we have a copy of it that 's ok for research we removed identifying let 's see if people on these two drugs have problems with their glucose now there are thousands and thousands of people in the stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin but we needed special patients we needed patients who were on one of them then got the second one and had another glucose measurement all within a reasonable period of time something like two months out of the ten had a bump in their glucose when they got the second p we call this p and p when they got the second p either one could be first the second one comes up glucose went up and if it gets up to one hundred and twenty one hundred your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes so a twenty bump but i 'm sorry we still don 't have a paper because this is ten patients and give me a break it 's not enough patients the other p the glucose measurements in that range that we need so at the end we had one hundred and fifty patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly more interestingly we had left out diabetics because diabetics already have messed up glucose when we looked at the glucose of diabetics it was going up sixty milligrams per deciliter not just twenty it was all data evidence data from the fda but we were nervous while the paper was in review went to the lab we found somebody who knew about lab stuff i don 't do that i take care of patients but i don 't do pipettes and we gave a third group of mice both of them and lo and behold glucose went up twenty to sixty milligrams per deciliter in the mice but we added a little note at the end saying oh by the way if you give these to mice it but i still have six and a half minutes so we were sitting around thinking about all of this and i don 't remember who thought of it but somebody said i wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs they could and they should how would we ever determine that what do you do you 're taking a medication one new medication or two and you get a funny feeling let 's ask google if they will share their search logs with us so that we can look at the search logs and see if patients are doing these kinds of searches i was at a at a dinner with a colleague who works at microsoft research and i said we wanted to do this study google said no it 's kind of a bummer have the bing searches yeah that 's great now i felt like i was you might not understand we not only have bing searches but if you use then for eighteen months we keep that data for research purposes only i said now you 're talking so we did a study where we defined fifty words that a regular person might type in if they 're having hyperglycemia peeing a lot forgive me but that 's one of the things you might type in so we had fifty phrases that we called the diabetes words 5 to one percent of all searches on the internet involve one of those words so that 's our baseline rate the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes type words if you already know that there 's that paroxetine word if it 's pravastatin the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline it goes up to ten percent a huge three to four fold increase in those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in and we published this and it got some attention the reason it deserves attention is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly through their searches they have set up social media surveillance programs to collaborate with microsoft either individually or together are causing problems what do i take from this why tell this story well first of all we have now the promise of big data and medium sized data to help us understand drug interactions and really drugs work this will create and has created a new ecosystem for understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use nick went on he 's a professor at columbia now he did this in his phd for hundreds of pairs of drugs he found several very important interactions and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding nine drugs being taken by the same patient perhaps interacting with each other in ways that either makes them more effective or less open field for us to use data to try to understand the interaction of drugs two more lessons i want you to think about the power that we were able to generate with the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions through their pharmacists through themselves through their doctors the people who allowed the databases at stanford harvard vanderbilt to be used for research because it is too rich of a source of inspiration innovation and discovery for new things in medicine they could throw somebody into diabetes they could be a new and novel treatment for diseases that don 't have treatments or where the treatments are not effective if we think about drug treatment today and the subject for a different ted talk on a different day is how can we use the same data sources to find good effects of drugs in combination that will provide us new treatments"
