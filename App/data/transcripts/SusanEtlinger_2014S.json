  "transcript": "the culture critic neil postman wrote a book called comparing the dystopian visions of george orwell and aldous huxley orwell feared we would become a captive culture huxley feared we would become a trivial culture orwell feared the truth would be concealed from us and huxley feared we would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance in a nutshell it 's a choice between big brother watching you and you watching big brother but it doesn 't have to be this way we are not passive consumers of data and technology we shape the role it plays in our lives and the way we make meaning from it but to do that we have to pay as much attention to how we think and hard questions to move past counting things to understanding them we 're constantly bombarded with stories about how much data there is in the world but when it comes to big data and the challenges of interpreting it size isn 't everything text and what unites this disparate types of data is that they 're created by people and they require context now there 's a group of data scientists out of the university of and they 're called the health media collaboratory and they 've been working with the centers for disease control to better understand how people talk about quitting smoking the interesting thing is if you want to understand how people talk about smoking first you have to understand what they mean when they say smoking smoking marijuana smoking ribs and number four smoking hot women laughter so then you have to think about well how do people talk about electronic cigarettes and there are so many different ways that people do this and you can see from the slide and what it reminds us is that language is created by people and people are messy and we 're complex and we use metaphors and slang and jargon and we do this twenty four seven in many many languages and then as soon as we so did these ads that the cdc put on these television ads that featured a woman with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic and very disturbing and the health media collaboratory but they were able to conclude that those advertisements and you may have seen them and what i admire and appreciate about this project aside from the fact including the fact that it 's based on real human need is that it 's a fantastic example of courage in the face of a sea of irrelevance and so it 's not just big data that causes challenges of interpretation because let 's face it we human beings have a very rich history of taking any amount of data no matter how small and screwing it up so many years ago you may remember that former president ronald reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things but i actually think there 's but sometimes they 're stupid too i want to tell you a personal story about why this matters a lot to me i need to take a breath my but the metrics on his developmental evaluations which looked at things like the number of words at that point gestures and minimal eye contact put his developmental level at that of a nine month old baby i found him in front of the i did what any obsessed parent would do which is immediately started hitting the back button to see what else he 'd been searching for school bus and i was stunned we didn 't know that he could spell much less read and so i asked him isaac how did you do this and he looked at me very seriously and said typed in the box but and this is what happens when assessments and analytics overvalue one metric in this case verbal such as creative and so he found a workaround to find out what he needed to know but he could get himself a lot of the way there by putting a word in a search box and so this little moment had a really profound impact on me and worry a little bit less and appreciate his resourcefulness more and they 're vulnerable to misuse or otherwise i have a friend emily willingham who 's a scientist and she wrote a piece for forbes not long ago and of course mothers because there 's more there 's a whole bunch in the mother category here and you can see it 's a pretty rich and interesting list i 'm a big fan of being pregnant near freeways personally the final one is interesting because the term refrigerator mother was actually the original hypothesis for the cause of autism and that meant somebody who was cold and unloving and at this point you might be thinking but the challenge is that because frankly data doesn 't create meaning we do so businesspeople as consumers as patients as citizens we have a responsibility i think because at this point in our history as we 've heard many times over we can process exabytes of data at lightning speed and we have the potential to make bad decisions and so and the social sciences because after all if and this means teaching ourselves to find those confirmation biases and false correlations and being able to spot the romans called this post hoc ergo propter hoc after which therefore because of which we need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls and consumer opt in the methodologies that we use and our confidence in the result because and it means asking ourselves really the hardest question of all did the data really show us this or does the result make us feel more successful so but did they conclude that they actually made people stop smoking no it 's science not magic if we are to unlock the power of data we don 't have to go blindly into orwell 's vision of a totalitarian future or huxley 's vision of a trivial one or some horrible cocktail of both what we have to do is treat critical thinking with respect and be inspired thank you"
