  "transcript": "i love the joy that color can give and i try to bring and i see not but for and the role it can play for the better in our lives demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public and use of colors in order to revive the hope it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget i had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something when we painted the first building by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of of a facade something unimaginable happened there was a traffic traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident the french e u official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting he screeched that he because the colors you have ordered do not meet european standards he replied even though this is not what but we will choose the colors ourselves because this is exactly what we want i will hold a press conference and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era then and asked me for a compromise and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime so it 's time for change the rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to the pride of people and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space and when colors came out everywhere a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people big noise raised up what is this what is happening what are colors doing to us we asked people and then the second question was do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue we like it they wanted it to continue so we noticed change people started to drop less litter in the streets for example started to pay taxes started and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police or the state itself were missing one day i remember walking when i saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop they had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place why what policemen you can see it for yourself there are colors streetlights new pavement with no potholes it was beauty that was giving people crime the freedom that was won in the paint on on the walls but it gave hope and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things a different spirit different feel to our lives and that we could build a better life we removed one hundred we demolished more than five thousand illegal buildings all over the city then everybody accepted it we managed and we thus managed to build a public institution where men and women were equally represented international organizations have invested a lot in albania during these twenty years not all of it well spent when i told the world bank directors that i wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption they did not understand me but people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows they were paying in order to skip the queue the reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole and on the other hand a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe we could change the invisible clerks but we could not change this corrupt practice i 'm convinced i told a german official with the world bank that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in germany in a german administration just as i am convinced they would be bribed just the same with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience it we built the bright new reception hall that made people tirana citizens think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make requests we created an online system we put the citizen first and the corruption in the state administration of countries like albania it 's not up to me to say also like greece can be reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself and not reinventing people based on a ready made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose while politics more and more fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the of the common people politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign i but it also lets people and allowing everybody 's voice to be heard is exactly what we need politics is not just about leaders it 's not just about politicians and laws it is about how people think how they view the world around them how they use their time and their energy ask yourself if obama was the same as bush they are not they are human beings with different views and different visions for the world when people say nothing can change just stop and think what the world was like ten i gave you a very small example the use of color can make change happen i want to make more change but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to president roosevelt he said believe you can and you are halfway there"
