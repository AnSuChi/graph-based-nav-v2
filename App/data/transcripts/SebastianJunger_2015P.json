  "transcript": "i worked as a war reporter this was about a year before nine eleven and we were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war on the human psyche i 'd been in afghanistan for a couple of months with the northern alliance as they were fighting the taliban and at that point the taliban and we really got hammered pretty badly a couple of times we saw some very ugly things i had a massive panic attack but i couldn 't i backed up against a support column and just waited for it when i couldn 't take it any longer i ran out of the subway station and walked wherever i was going i found out that what i had was we evolved as animals as primates to survive periods of danger and if wake up easily you want to have nightmares and and flashbacks of the thing that could kill you you want to be angry because it makes you predisposed to fight or depressed most people recover from that pretty quickly it takes a few weeks a few months i kept having panic attacks but they eventually went away i had no idea it was connected to the war that and then i thought well now i 'm not going crazy anymore they are we know that the people who are vulnerable who suffered trauma as children people who have low education levels people who have psychiatric disorders in their family if you served in vietnam and your brother is schizophrenic you 're way more likely to get long term ptsd from vietnam so i started to study this as a journalist and i realized that there was something really strange going on every war that we have fought as a country starting with the civil war the intensity of the combat has gone down as a result the casualty rates thank god a casualty rate but they 've also created they 've also produced three times the disability rates around ten percent of the us military is ten percent or under they 're shooting at people killing people getting shot at but about half of our military has filed for some kind of we 've all heard the tragic statistic of twenty two vets a day on average most people don 't realize that the majority of those suicides are veterans and their decision to take their own lives actually might not be related to the war they fought fifty years earlier there 's no statistical connection between combat and suicide in the military and you 're in a lot of combat you 're no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren 't in fact one study found that if you deploy to iraq or afghanistan you 're actually slightly less likely i did my fieldwork on the navajo i had this thought i bet the apache the comanche i mean these are very warlike nations i bet they weren 't getting ptsd like we do when their warriors came back from fighting the us and maybe what determines the rate of long term ptsd isn 't what happened out there but the kind of society you come back to and maybe if you come back to a close cohesive tribal society and if you come back to an alienating modern society you might remain traumatized certainly on the human psyche by every metric that we have the suicide rate goes up instead of down if you live in modern society you 're up to eight times more likely to suffer from depression in your lifetime than if you live in a poor agrarian society i saw one study that compared women in nigeria one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt and poorest countries in so around fifty percent have filed for ptsd compensation so about forty percent of veterans really were not traumatized overseas but have the phantom forty percent that are troubled but don 't understand why maybe it 's this maybe they had an experience of sort of tribal closeness in their unit when they were overseas and then they come home and they have to give all that up and they 're coming back to a society a modern society which is hard on people but for a lot of these people soldiers are traumatized and the ones who are have to be treated for that but a lot of them maybe what 's bothering them is actually a kind of alienation i mean i mean maybe we just have the wrong word for some of it and just changing our language our understanding would help a little bit alienation disorder maybe even just calling it that for some of these people would allow them to stop imagining trying to imagine a trauma that didn 't really happen in order to explain a feeling that really is happening and in fact it 's an extremely dangerous feeling that alienation and depression can lead to suicide these people are in danger the theory is that everyone in israel is supposed to serve in the military when soldiers come back from the front line they 're not going from a military environment to a civilian environment they 're coming back to a community where everyone everyone understands we know that if you take a lab rat and if you take that same lab rat and put it in a cage with other rats the violent crime rate in new york went down after nine eleven even combat veterans of previous wars who suffered from ptsd said that their symptoms went down after nine eleven happened basically we tribalize and that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us that it even helps people who are struggling admissions to psychiatric wards went down during the bombings for a while that was the kind of country that american soldiers came back to we were sticking together we were trying trying to help american veterans are coming back to a country that is so bitterly divided that the two political parties are literally accusing each other of treason of being an enemy of the the gap between rich and poor is the biggest it 's ever been it 's just getting worse race relations are terrible and veterans know that any tribe that treated itself that way in fact any platoon that treated itself that way would never survive we 've gotten used to it veterans have gone away and are coming back and seeing their own country with fresh eyes and they see what 's going on this is the country they fought for no wonder they 're scared sometimes we ask ourselves if we can save the vets i think the vets are going to be fine thank you very much"
