  "transcript": "you become and if your life isn 't like that i 'd like to humbly suggest that you 're wasting your life life is too short to be wasted so what i propose to do in the next seventeen minutes i 've used up one minute already is to give you a set of powerful tools which can get you started on being there is that of interest to you audience yes srikumar but even if it wasn 't a conference on happiness would it be right if i said that in some way shape fashion or form what do you have to get in order anybody quick etc etc right now if you were to think about it you probably have a list of here 's what i need to get in order to be happy i would like you to consider this anything that you can get a number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already so whatever you get that can make you happy can go away where does that leave you not a very nice place right i have a different proposition to suggest to you in fact happiness is your innate nature it is hardwired into you it is part of your dna and and invariably somebody articulates what many of you are thinking which is if happiness how come i am experiencing my life sucks the answer to that is actually very simple you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy and the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model a mental model is a notion we 've got mental models on how to find a job how to get ahead at work how to pick a restaurant to eat at how to have a movie to go to dozens of them the problem isn 't that we have mental models the problem is that we don 't know that we have mental models we think this is the way the world and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something then we will be happy if only i i had children if my children would grow up and go to college it and right now the only thing that 's different between the persons in this audience is what is the particular if that you are focusing on and the only thing that 's different between you now and years ago is what is the particular if that you were focusing on think about your life ten years ago spend a minute doing that odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted ten years ago you now is that correct where has that left you what we don 't realize is the model itself is flawed the and then i will be happy i can demonstrate any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity virtually all of you could right have you ever wondered why that happened the reason that happened is that somehow for some reason at that instant you accepted the universe exactly as it was but it 's kind of off to the left and if i could move it two hundred yards to the right it would be ever so much more beautiful you didn 't say that 's a beautiful valley but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches so if you gave me a chainsaw and twenty minutes i 'd make it ever so much better and the moment you accepted the universe just as it was and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced and you felt it and i know you felt it because now the problem is that your life right now with all of the problems that you have more precisely all of the problems that you think you have is equally perfect but you do not accept it in fact you 're spending all your time striving so let me show you how you can get out of that or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that i 'd like to share with you that action we all live our lives because we want to achieve something correct you know we are here and we want to have something alex wants to have a successful conference you know many of you want to have great programs for your companies that are very successful you want to progress have more money all of that is that correct you would like something to happen not entirely but to a large extent some of the time you don 't achieve your goal and like there was a friend of mine who said gee you know i have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife and this has to change so the next time we went on a business trip he bought a very expensive dress for her and this was his way of showing you know i care for you and nice things would happen and when he presented the gift to his wife her immediate reaction was after twenty years of marriage you don 't know my size and furthermore don 't you know i never wear this kind of thing and the next thing you know marital spat has that happened to any of you you 've taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted happens all the time well and if i how we live we invest in the outcome and as i 've just pointed out the outcome is frequently different from what we would like and sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like you invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck and the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome you invest in the process i don 't know how many of you are familiar with john wooden he he 's the only person ever to make the basketball hall of fame both as a player and as a coach and what he told his entering team he led ucla to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the ncaa and what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning when it 's over and you look in the mirror did you do the best that you were capable of but i would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of you will find the score to your liking this is what i want oh but you are always focusing on this is the outcome now investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement what you can do is something else you can invest in the process and then you invest let me give you an example and if you have children raise your hands if you have children what happens and this happens typically between eleven and thirteen months is the child gets up and after some time mommy feels tired and no longer runs up and the child stops crying and then she gets up takes a step and doesn 't fall down and then she takes another and a beautiful smile comes on her face and very soon generally within twenty four hours she 's walking all over the place upsetting right now imagine what would happen if each time the child fell she would say i 'm never going to learn to walk and you have to get counseling for her to help her deal with feelings of inadequacy and not being able to achieve and fail yet again how long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that if what we do is the exact opposite as we grow up we lose the ability to invest in the and if that 's where we spend all of our emotional energy we are going to get drained as we do i am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit i could every day is a blast and you 're well on your way to achieving the vision that i outlined to you the question that i get all the time nothing makes me passionate so i say ok what would and they invariably come up with you know here is a list of things here 's my job and here 's how much it pays this is the kind of person my boss is the kind of people my colleagues are and here 's how my customers you because all of that stuff first of all it doesn 't exist and if you don 't find a way to ignite it within you right where you are you then you will find that the external world rearranges itself and as you do that you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis persons come up whom you 're delighted to meet new people enter your life it 's just a breeze you watch desperate housewives you go on a journey you go on a journey where 40 something women are having affairs with there 's nothing wrong with that but just ask yourself is this a journey i want to take does this take me to a place i want to spend time the things you talk about the movies you go to the books you read everything changes not in the outcome"
