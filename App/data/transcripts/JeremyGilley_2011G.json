  "transcript": "i couldn 't understand the starvation the destruction the killing of innocent people making sense of those things is a very when i was twelve i became an actor i was bottom of the class i haven 't got any qualifications i was told i was dyslexic which was useful obviously and so concern is where all of this comes from and then being an actor i was doing these different kinds of things and i felt the content of the work that i this wonderful nuclear physicist and he said that media had a responsibility that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward and that fascinated me because i 'd been to in some way make a difference maybe there 's a little change i can get involved in so i started thinking about peace and i was obviously as i said to you very much moved by these images trying to make sense of that but i realized that having been messing around with structure as an that there needed to be a mountain to climb there needed to be a journey that i had to take and if i took that journey the point was that i would have something to hook the questions of is humankind fundamentally evil is the destruction of the world inevitable should i have children is that a responsible thing to do etc etc there was no day of there was no day of intercultural cooperation there was no day when humanity came together separate in all of those things and just shared it together that we 're in this and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated then that might be the key to humanity 's survival that might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces if we did it just for a day have any money i was living at my mom 's place and we started writing letters to everybody you very quickly work out what is it that you 've got to do to and i wanted it to be the 21st of september because it was my granddad 's favorite number he was a the bomb go off at nagasaki it poisoned his blood he died when i was eleven so he was like my hero and the reason why twenty one was the number is seven hundred men left nobel peace laureates various organizations literally wrote to everybody and very quickly some letters started coming back and we started to and i remember the first letter one of the first letters was from the dalai lama and of course we didn 't have the money we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [ this mail ] a letter came through from the dalai lama saying this is an amazing thing come and see me i 'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace and we didn 't have money for the flight and i rang sir bob ayling who was ceo of ba at the time and said mate we 've got this could you give me a flight because we 're going to go see him and of course we went and saw him and it was amazing and then dr oscar arias came forward and actually let me go back to that slide because lots of people all the press because and we invited everybody and no press showed up there were one hundred and fourteen people there they were mostly my friends and family and that was kind of like the launch of this thing but it didn 't matter because we were documenting and that was the thing i 'm cutting my hair it 's getting short and long because every time i saw kofi annan i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it and that was kind of what was going on nobel peace laureate president now of costa rica said i 'll do everything that i can so i went and saw amr moussa at the league of arab states i met mandela at the arusha peace talks and so on and so on and so on while i was building the case to prove and i 've always spoken to women and children wherever i 've gone i 've recorded forty four thousand young people i 've recorded about nine hundred hours of their thoughts i 'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry their art their literature their music their sport whatever it might be and we were listening to everybody and it was an incredibly thing working with the u n and working with and it was this i actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened it didn 't actually matter it didn 't matter if it didn 't create a day of peace the fact is that if i tried and it didn 't work then i could make a statement about how unwilling and that young boy who was a child and that actually at that i 'm going to document until this becomes a reality because we 've got to we 've got to do something where we unite separate from all the politics and religion that as a young person is confusing me i don 't know i was invited to new york the costa rican government and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly with and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world a reality and thank you to all of them that was an incredible moment i was at the top of the general assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen and as i mentioned when it started we were at the globe and there was no press and obviously he never came down the statement was never made the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence and it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives and we have to tell people and we have to prove it can work and i left new york and i felt inspired by the the possibilities that if it did then maybe we wouldn 't see things like that i remember putting that film out and cynics i was showing the film and i remember being in israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film that it 's just a day of peace it doesn 't mean anything it 's not going to work you 're not going to stop the fighting in afghanistan the taliban won 't listen etc etc and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways and they 'd all tell me if you can create a window of opportunity we can move aid we can vaccinate children children can lead their projects they can unite they can come together and i went back to the u n for another couple of years governments and ngos trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it see if we could make it possible and after lots and lots of meetings obviously i 'm god bless them they said okay we 'll it was historical could it work in afghanistan with unama and who and at least and i saw him because he was an actor i was an actor i had a connection to him because we needed to get to the press we needed this attraction we needed the because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there 'd be more when we got into certain areas maybe there would be more people interested and maybe we 'd be helped financially a little bit more which had been desperately difficult so i said to him do you want to come with me it 'd be really interesting if you came it would help and bring attention and that attention would help leverage the situation as well as all of the other sides of it i think there 's a number of pillars to to success one is you 've got to have a great idea the other is you 've got to have a constituency you 've got to have finance and you 've got to be able to raise awareness and actually i could never raise awareness by myself no matter what i 'd achieved so these it was a really incredible thing that when we landed there i was talking to various people and they were saying to me and we traveled around and we spoke to elders we spoke to doctors we spoke to nurses we held press we sat down with isaf we sat down with nato we sat down with the u k government i mean we basically sat down with everybody in and out of schools with ministers of education holding these press conferences which of course now were loaded with press everybody was there there was an interest in what was going on this amazing woman fatima gailani was in what went on as she she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere and she was really crucial in getting the message in we see it as a window of opportunity not engage we 're not going to engage and that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn 't be kidnapped and then suddenly i obviously knew at this point there was a chance and days later one point six million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping and we wanted to support but more importantly we wanted to go back because they were the people who believed and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say look you guys made this possible obviously announced today isaf will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of september the violence was down by seventy percent seventy percent reduction in violence on this day at least and that completely blew my mind this time because of the volcano and i was there thinking about what was going on and i kept thinking about this seventy percent seventy percent reduction in violence in what then surely surely we can get seventy percent reduction we have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities both domestically and internationally ever recorded that 's and on the 21st of september this year we 're going to launch that campaign at the o2 arena to go for that process to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities and we will utilize all kinds of things have a dance and social media and visiting on facebook and visit the website sign the petition and it 's in the six official languages of the united nations and we 'll globally link with government and obviously the life saving is increased the why don 't you support the process of the largest ever global truce we 'll make a new film about this process we 'll utilize sport and football on the day of peace there 's thousands of football matches all played from the favelas of brazil to wherever it might be so utilizing all of these ways to inspire and when i stand here in front of all of you and the people who will watch these things i 'm excited that there is a possibility that our world could unite that we could come together as one that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues brought i think he 's one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics system he said no i 'd talk to the individuals it 's all about partnerships it 's about your about your businesses because together by working together i seriously think we can start to change things and there 's a wonderful man sitting in this audience and i don 't know where he is who said to me a few days ago because i did a little rehearsal and he said i 've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with three hundred and sixty five squares and one of them is white and it then made me think about a glass of water which is it 'll change it forever by working together we can create peace one day thank you ted"
