  "transcript": "what i am always thinking about is how to live period that 's all i 'm trying to do all day long and i 'm also trying to have some meals and have some snacks and you know and yell at yell at my children and do all the normal things that keep you grounded so i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy my older sister was busy torturing my parents and they were busy torturing her which is a fabulous thing actually i want to tell you so i was able to completely daydream my way through my life and i finally daydreamed my way into nyu at a very good time in one thousand nine where i met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of i was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him and but i kept writing bad poetry and he didn 't blow up the math building but he went to cuba but i gave him the money because i was from riverdale so i had more money than he did and that was a good thing to help but then he came back and things happened and i decided i really hated my writing that it was and i decided that i wanted to tell but i still wanted to tell a narrative story and i still wanted to tell my stories so i decided that i would start to draw how hard could that you know sheer and we started a we don 't know anything but that 's all right we 're going to do it anyway and as a matter of fact it 's better not to know anything because if you know too the premise in the studio was there are no boundaries there is no fear it was a collective it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas but and so some of the things i mean it was a long history of m so we decided and some of the watches there attempting to be beautiful and humorous maybe not attempting hopefully succeeding that to be able to talk about content to break apart what you normally expect to use humor and surprise elegance and it was a very the content is what 's important not the package not the wrapping you really have to be journalists you have to be inventors you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything the good news is that i have a dog and though i don 't know if i believe in luck i don 't know what i believe in it 's a very complicated question but i do know that before i go away i crank his tail seven times so whenever he sees a suitcase in the house but i am able to make the transition from working for children and from working for adults to children and back and forth because you know i can say that i 'm immature and in a way that 's true i don 't really i mean i could tell you that i didn 't understand gell mann 's talk i 'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and and finding out something new so in writing for children it seems simple and it is you have to condense a story into and what you have to do is you really have to edit down to what you want to say and hopefully you 're not talking down to kids and you 're not talking in such a way that you you know couldn 't stand reading it after one time so i hopefully am writing you know books that are good for children and for adults but the painting reflects i don 't think differently for children than i do for adults wonderful looking friends this is andrew gatz and he walked in through the door and i said you sit down there you know i take lots of photos and the bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair so and the books are really journals of my life i never i don 't like plots i don 't know what a plot means i can 't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning you know beginning middle and end it really scares me because my life is too random and too confused and i enjoy it that way and it was really a beautiful thing and so i was able to put that into this though i gave him hair over here and he doesn 't have hair well he has some hair but well he used to have hair and with him i was able to do a project that was really fantastic i work for the new yorker and i do covers and happened and it was you know a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it which we were able to we didn 't know what we were doing we weren 't trying to be funny we weren 't trying to be well and we didn 't know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people and it really became the i don 't know you know it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on and from you know fattushis to taxistan to you know for the fashtoonks botoxia who are what 's going on over here who are these people what are these tribes and david remnick who was really wonderful about it had one problem he didn 't like al it was a good thing you know in the course of my life i never know what 's going to happen and that 's kind of the beauty part and we were on cape cod a place obviously of great inspiration and i picked up this book the elements of style at a yard sale and i didn 't and i 'd never used it in school because i was too busy writing poems and flunking out and people should know about this book so i decided it needed a few it needed a lift it needed a few illustrations and and there are lots of grammar things do you mind me asking a question do you mind my asking a question or would should could and would is coco chanel 's lover should is edith sitwell and could is an august sander subject and he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug which i do or you can i don 't know what you know eat a sandwich so what i did when i was painting was i started singing because i really adore singing and i think that music is the highest form of all art so i commissioned a wonderful composer nico muhly who wrote nine songs using the text and we performed this fantastic evening of he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals i played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the new york public library where you 're supposed to be very very quiet and it was a phenomenally wonderful event which we hopefully will do who knows the new york op ed page asked me to do a column and they said you can do whatever you want so once a month for the last year i 've been doing a column called the principles of uncertainty which you know i 'm going to read quickly and probably i 'm going to edit some because i don 't have that much time left it was so amusing because i said well how much space do i have and they said well you know it 's the internet and i said yes but how much space do i have so the first one i was very timid and i 'll begin how can i tell you everything that is in my heart impossible to begin begin with the hapless dodo and i talk about the dodo and how the dodo became extinct and then i talk about spinoza as the last dodo was dying spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything called eudaemonia and then he died and there was no more spinoza extinct we don 't have a stuffed spinoza but we do have a stuffed pavlov 's dog and i visited him in the museum of hygiene in st petersburg in russia and there he is with this horrible electrical box on his rump decrepit palace and i think it must have been a very very dark day when the bolsheviks arrived maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs but stalin was a paranoid man even more than my father and decided his top people had to be extinctified which i think i made up which is a good thing you know thrown away imagine such such loss the river sluch they went to palestine and then america and that is my dna who i grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever facts were actually so it 's a miracle that i 'm here today but then she says tel aviv and lenin which is the town they came from and sorry the rest unknown thank you but in her lexicon sorry the rest unknown thank you is sorry the rest unknown go to hell because she couldn 't care less the impossibility of february is that february 's a really wretched month in new york and the images for me conjure up these really awful things well not so awful i received a box in the mail and and i say i hope he 's not really dead just enjoying a refreshing lie down in the snow but the caption says he is dead and actually he was i think he 's dead though i don 't know maybe he 's not dead and this woman leans over in anguish not about that man but about all sad things it happens quite often in february there 's consoling this man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase and i guess onions are a theme here and he says it is impossible not to lie it is february and not lying is impossible and i really spend a lot of time wondering how much truth do we tell what is it that we 're actually what story are we actually telling how do we know when we are ourselves how do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories you know are real sentences i 'm going to quickly go through this a quote by bertrand russell all the labor of all the ages all the devotion all the inspiration all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction and so you i taped my aunt i taped my aunt singing a song in russian from the you know could we have it for a second do you have that the elements of style"
