  "transcript": "imagine that you had your smartphone miniaturized and hooked up directly to your brain if you had this sort of brain chip you 'd be able to upload and download to the internet at the speed of thought accessing social media or wikipedia would be a lot like well from the inside at least like consulting your own memory it would be as easy and as intimate as thinking but would it make it easier for you to know what 's true and it doesn 't mean that you would be any better at evaluating it in fact you might even be worse because you know more data less time for evaluation but it seems as if the more information we share and access online the more difficult it can be for us to tell the difference between what 's real and what 's fake it 's as if we know more but understand less we 're polarized not just over values but over the facts everything from the ads we read to the news that comes down our facebook feed and so maybe it 's no surprise that we 're in a situation a paradoxical situation of thinking that we know so much more and yet not agreeing on what it is we know one obvious tactic is to try to fix our technology to redesign our digital platforms so as to make them less susceptible to polarization but i don 't think technology alone fixing it is going to solve the problem of knowledge polarization we 're going to need to reconnect with one fundamental the idea of a common reality i suppose a lot of philosophical concepts easy to state but mysteriously difficult to put into practice first we need to believe in truth you might have noticed that our culture is having something of a it seems as if we disagree so much that as one political commentator put it not but that thought it goes like this we just get more information from our perspective we might as well admit that objective truth is an illusion or it 'll never know what it is or it doesn 't exist in the first place that 's not a new philosophical thought skepticism about truth but it really goes back all the way to the greek philosopher protagoras if not farther back protagoras said that objective truth was an illusion because self serving rationalization disguised look we might all be living in the matrix you might have a brain chip in your head feeding you all the wrong information we agree we agree or we should skepticism about truth can be tempting when we do that we 're sort of like the guy in the movie after all getting what you want feels good so often it 's easier for us to wrap ourselves in our cozy information bubbles live in bad faith and take those bubbles as the measure of reality an example i think of how this bad faith gets into our action is the fake news that spread on the internet during the american presidential election of two thousand and sixteen was designed to feed into our biases but what was really striking about it was not just that it fooled so many people the phenomenon so much so that the very term the very term fake news now just means news story i don 't like that 's an example of the bad faith towards the truth that i 'm talking about dangerous thing about skepticism with regard to truth is that it leads to despotism man is the measure of all things inevitably becomes the man is the of all things just as every man for himself always seems to turn out to be only the strong survive at the end of orwell 's the thought policeman o 'brien is torturing the protagonist winston smith into believing two plus two equals five says is the point is that he wants to convince smith that whatever the party says is the truth and the truth is whatever the party says critical dissent is impossible you can 't speak truth to power if the power speaks truth by definition the second thing can be summed up by the latin phrase that kant took as the motto for the enlightenment sapere or dare to know or as kant wants to dare to know for yourself i think in the early days of the internet a lot of us thought that information but as the internet has become more and more a part of our lives our reliance on it our use of it has become often more passive much of what we know today we google know we download prepackaged prepackaged sets of facts and sort of shuffle them along the assembly line of social media we offload our effort onto a network of others and algorithms and that allows us of course to not clutter our minds with all sorts of facts we can just download them when we need them and that 's awesome but there 's a difference between downloading a set of facts and really understanding how or why those facts are as they are understanding why involves more than just downloading it 's going to require most likely doing some work for yourself getting out into the field doing the experiment working through the proof talking to someone i 'm not saying of course that we should stop google knowing i 'm just saying we shouldn 't overvalue we need to find ways of encouraging forms of knowing that are more active and don 't always involve passing off our effort into our bubble because the thing about google knowing is that too often it ends up being bubble knowing and bubble knowing means always being right daring to understand means risking the possibility that you could be wrong it means risking the possibility that what you want which brings me to the third thing that i think we need to do if we want to accept that we live in a common reality that third thing is have a little humility by humility here i mean epistemic but it also means something more than that it means seeing your that 's more than just being open to change it 's more than just being open to self improvement it means seeing your knowledge as capable of enhancing or being enriched by what that 's part of what is involved in recognizing there 's a common reality that you too are responsible to i don 't think it 's much of a stretch to say that our society is not particularly great at enhancing or encouraging that sort of humility that 's partly because but that 's another example of the bad faith towards the truth that i 've been talking about so the concept of a common reality like a lot of philosophical concepts can seem so obvious that we can look right past it democracies can 't function if their citizens don 't strive at least some of the time to inhabit a common space a space where they can pass ideas back and forth when and especially when they disagree but you can 't strive to inhabit that space if you don 't already accept that you live in the same reality to accept that we 've got to believe in truth we 've got to encourage more active ways of knowing and we 've got to have the humility we may yet we need to remember that our perspectives thank you"
