  "transcript": "have milestones in life that we remember so vividly the first one for me was when i was entering kindergarten my big brother was in school and by golly it was my time and i go to the door and there was the teacher with a warm welcome showed me my little cubbyhole we all remember those little cubbyholes don 't we and we put our stuff in there and then she said go over to the circle and play with the kids until class starts so i went over there and plopped down like and i 'm playing and all of a sudden the boy next to me he was wearing suddenly he stopped playing and he said why are you so short and i just kept playing i didn 't think he was talking to me what are you talking about been waiting for this and so we played and about a minute later the girl next to him in a white shirt and a pink skirt stood up put her hands on her hips and said yeah why do you look so different again let 's just play about this time i looked all around the circle i was in and all the kids had stopped playing and they were all looking at me and i 'm thinking in today 's language it would be omg or wtf so all the confidence that i went in with that morning was was withering away as the morning went on and the questions kept coming the end of the morning before i went home and over the next few years i hated to go out in public i felt every stare every giggle every pointed and as a child you can 't understand another child 's curiosity nor an adult 's ignorance it became very apparent to me that the real world was not built and so i have no anonymity as you can probably tell and some you can see like mine most you can 't you can 't tell if someone 's dealing with a mental illness or they 're struggling with their gender identity they 're caring for an aging parent they 're having financial difficulty you can 't see that kind of stuff seeing does not mean you understand what it 's truly to be me on a daily basis or what i go through and because of that we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves but we can be supportive of each other instead of trying to walk in each other 's shoes we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves i learned at an early age that i did have to do some things different than most people but i also learned there were things i was on equal footing with and one of those was the classroom heh heh heh i was equal as this was vitally important i discovered as i grew older and realized i wasn 't going to be able to do a physical remember your first interview what am i going to wear i was right there with you hours before my interview a friend of mine who i 've known all my life called and said michele they had no idea what i went through for the day and that 's ok you 're probably thinking my greatest challenge that day was the interview or getting in the building in reality my biggest challenge that day was getting through the loading dock without getting run over and so i have to be very careful i have to anticipate and be flexible run through security get to the gate did i get my aisle seat or my window seat did i get my upgrade me first i get to experience the personal patdown i won 't comment on that and with my gift of gab that my parents said i was born with and i can drive it down to the door of the plane the day before i had called the city where i 'm traveling to to find out where i could rent a scooter in case mine gets broken so in my shoes it 's a little bit different when i get onto the plane i use my gift of gab to ask the lady to put my bag up and they graciously do but nature has its own schedule it knocked and i answered so i walked up to the front of the plane and gabbed with the flight attendant and said can you watch the door i can 't reach the lock and there 's a gentleman there with a look of horror on his face i 'm sure i had the same look as i came out i noticed that he was sitting right across from me and he 's in total so i walk up to him and i quietly go are you going to remember this as much as i am and he goes i think so now while he 's probably not talking about it publicly i am and we got to know each other our families sports work and when we landed he said michele i noticed someone put your bag up can i get that for you and i said of course thank you and the most important thing that day was that he was not going to leave with that embarrassment that experience of embarrassment he won 't forget it and neither will i but i think he remember more our chat and our different perspectives and i come wheeling in and think about that blond so i go so i had to kind of say and it was the most magnificent hour our perspective changed for both of us that day and as you notice i get a lot of help i would not be where i am today if it was not for my family my friends my colleagues and the many strangers that help me every single day of my life and it 's important that we all have a support system asking for help is a strength not a weakness we all need help throughout our lifetime as important that we are part of other people 's support systems we must adopt that way of giving back but think about the role we have to play in other people 's successes just like people do for me every single day it 's vitally important that we help each other because society is increasingly placing people in silos and we must look past the surface and be confronted with the truth that none of us are what you can see there 's more to us than that and we 're all dealing with things that you cannot see so living a life free of judgment allows all of us to share those experiences together so remember the only shoes you truly can walk but we can do something better than that courage and understanding we can walk side by side and support one another and think about how society can change if we all do that thank you"
