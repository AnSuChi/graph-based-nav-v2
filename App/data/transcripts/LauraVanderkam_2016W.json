  "transcript": "when people find out i write about time management they assume two things one is that i 'm always on time and i 'm not i was once late to my own speech on time management we all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony the second thing they assume is that i have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there sometimes i 'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day and the idea is that we 'll shave bits of time off everyday activities add it up and we 'll have time for the good stuff but i 'm always interested in hearing what they 've come up with before they call me some of my favorites doing errands where you only have to make right hand turns being extremely judicious in microwave usage it says three to three and a half minutes on the package we 're totally getting in on the bottom side of that and my personal favorite which makes sense so in the course of two hours of watching tv you find thirty two minutes to exercise don 't watch two hours of tv a day right the idea is we 'll save bits of time here and there add it up we will finally get to everything we want to do but after studying how successful people spend their time i think this idea has it completely backward we don 't build the lives we want by saving time we build the lives we want and then time saves here 's what i mean i recently did a time diary project looking at one thousand and one days in the lives of extremely busy women they had demanding jobs sometimes their own businesses kids to care for maybe parents to care for community commitments busy busy people and i interviewed them about their strategies for my book one of the women whose time log i studied goes out on a wednesday night for something she comes home to find that her water heater has broken and there is now water all over her basement if you 've ever had anything like this happen to you you know it is a hugely damaging frightening sopping mess so she 's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night next day she 's got plumbers coming in day after that professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet all this is being recorded on her time log winds up taking seven hours of her week seven hours but i 'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people i 'm sure she would 've said what most of us would 've said which is no can 't you see how busy i am yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement and so the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater to get at this i like to use language from one of the busiest people i ever interviewed i remember it was a thursday morning and she was not available to speak with me of course right but the reason she was unavailable to speak with me and when i finally do catch up with her she explains it like this she says listen laura everything i do every minute i spend is my choice and rather than say i don 't have time to do x y or z because it 's not a priority i don 't have time often means it 's not a priority if you offered to pay me $ one hundred thousand to dust my blinds i would get to it pretty quickly since that is not going to happen i can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time and granted there may be horrible consequences for making different choices i will give you that so how do we do that how do we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken well first we need to figure out what they are you look back over your successes over the year your opportunities for growth and this serves its purpose but i find it 's more effective to do this looking forward so i want you to pretend it 's the end of next year you 're giving yourself a performance review and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally what three to five things did you do that made it so amazing so you can write next year 's performance review and you can do this for your personal life too i 'm sure many of you like me come december get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter bit of a wretched genre of literature really going on about how amazing everyone in the household is or even more scintillating how busy everyone in the household is but these letters serve a purpose which is that they tell your friends and family what you did in your personal life that mattered to you and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you and the people you care about what three to five things did you do that made it so amazing so you can write next year 's family holiday letter now don 't send it and now between the performance review and now we need to break these down into doable steps so maybe you want to write a family history first you can read some other family histories get a sense for the style maybe think about the questions you want to ask your relatives set up appointments to interview them and then this is key we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater by putting them into our schedules first we do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them i find a really good time to do this is friday afternoons most of us are not sitting there on friday afternoons saying i am excited to make progress toward my personal and professional priorities right now laughter but we are willing to think about what those should be so take a little bit of time self not so much then look out over the whole of the next week and see where you can plan them in where you plan them in is up to you i know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others i mean some people 's lives are just harder than others it is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple children on your own but i do think that the numbers i am about to tell is one hundred and sixty eight hours that sleeping eight hours a night so fifty six hours a week that leaves seventy two hours for other well that leaves fifty two hours for you say you 're working more than sixty hours well are you sure there was once a study comparing people 's estimated work weeks with time diaries they found that people anyway in one hundred and sixty eight hours a week i think we can find time for what matters to you if you want to spend more time with your kids you want to study more for a test you 're taking you want to exercise for three hours and volunteer for two you can and that 's even if you 're working but when most of us have bits of time what do we do but small moments can have great power you can use your bits of time for bits of joy maybe it 's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus on the way to work breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying if family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule maybe family breakfast could be a good substitute it 's about looking at the whole of one 's time and seeing where the good stuff can go and when we focus on what matters we can build the lives we want in the time we 've got"
