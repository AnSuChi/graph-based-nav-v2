  "transcript": "i 'd like you to imagine the world anew i 'd like to show you some maps which have been drawn by ben hennig of the planet in a way that most of you will never have seen the planet depicted before here 's an image that you 're very familiar with i 'm old enough that i was actually born before we saw this image apparently some of my first words were moona moona but i think that 's my mom having a particular fantasy about what her baby boy could see on the flickering black and white tv screen it 's only been a few centuries since we 've actually most of us of our planet as spherical when we first saw these images in the world was changing at an incredible rate in my own little discipline of human geography a cartographer called waldo tobler was drawing new and these maps have now spread and i 'm going to show you one of them now this map but it 's a map which looks to you a little bit strange it 's a map in which we stretched places so that those areas which contain many people and those areas like the sahara and the himalayas in which there are few people have been shrunk away everybody on the planet is given an equal amount of space the cities are shown the lines are showing you submarine cables and trade routes and there 's one particular line that goes from the chinese port of dalian through past singapore through the suez canal through the mediterranean and round to rotterdam and it 's showing you the route of what was the world 's largest ship just a year ago was taking so many containers of goods this just on one ship on one voyage in five weeks weeks this is atalhyk one of the world 's first cities at its peak nine thousand years ago people had to walk over the roofs of others if you look carefully at the map of the city you 'll see it has no streets we work out slowly and gradually and the world has changed incredibly quickly most recently it 's only within the last six seven or eight generations that we have actually realized that we are a species it 's only within the last few decades that a map like this could be drawn the underlying map is the map of world population but over it you 're seeing arrows showing how we spread out of africa with dates showing you where we think we arrived at particular times i have to redraw because somebody makes a discovery that a particular date we are learning about ourselves at an incredible speed and we 're changing a lot of change is gradual it 's accretion we don 't notice if you 're lucky ninety years this graph is showing you the annual rate of population growth in the and then the rate of population growth began to rise so that around the time i was born when we first saw those images from the moon of our planet if it had carried on growing at two percent a year for just another couple of centuries centuries the entire planet would be covered with a seething mass of human bodies all touching each other and people were scared the noughties and in this decade even faster our population growth is slowing our planet is stabilizing we are heading towards nine ten or eleven billion people by the end of the century within that change you can see you can and eighteen from influenza you can see the great chinese famine these are the events we tend to concentrate on we tend to concentrate on the terrible events in the news we don 't tend to concentrate on we worry about how you can get away from people but this is the map of the world changed again to make area large the further away people are from each area so if you want to know where to go to get away from everybody here 's the best places to go and every year these areas get bigger because every year we are coming off the land globally we are moving into the we are packing in more densely there are wolves again in europe and the wolves are moving west this is a map showing where the water falls on our planet we now know that and you can look at where instead of making the map and you see the and all of this only became possible this is a map of where we grow our food in the world this is the areas that we will rely on most for rice and maize and corn if we just ate less meat and fed less of the crops to animals there is enough food for everybody and we also know know about what we do so terribly badly nowadays you will have seen this is the map produced by taking satellite images if you remember those satellites around the planet in the very first slide i showed and producing an image of what the earth looks like at night when you normally see that map on a normal map the kind of map that most of you will be used to you think you are seeing a map of where people live where the lights are shining up is where people live but here on this image of the world remember we 've stretched the map again everywhere has the same density of people on this map we 've shrunk it away to make it disappear so we 're showing everybody with equal prominence now the lights no longer show you where people are because people are everywhere now the lights the lights in london the lights in cairo the lights in tokyo the lights on the eastern seaboard of the united states the lights show you where people live who are so profligate with energy that they can afford to spend money powering lights to shine up into the sky satellites can draw an image like this because ever since the tsunami in japan japan has had to rely on a quarter less electricity because it turned you just shone less light there are a huge number of good news stories infant mortality is falling and has been falling the number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world fell by five percent in just one year more children are going to school and learning to read and write and getting connected to the internet and and the highest number of young people going to university in the world are women not men but we tend to concentrate when she explained the accretion of incremental imperceptible changes which can constitute progress and which render our era dramatically different from the past the past was much more stable the undramatic nature of gradual transformation punctuated by occasional tumult occasionally terrible things happen you are shown those terrible things you are not told you are not told about the incredible improvements in understanding you are not told about how we are learning to begin to waste less and consume less this is my last map on this map we have taken the seas and the oceans out now you are just looking at about seven point four billion people with the map drawn in proportion to those people you 're looking at over you can see that india and we in exeter today are on the far edge of the we are on a tiny scrap of rock off europe which contains less than one percent of the world 's adults and less than half a percent of the world 's children there are many many things to be frightened about and we need to see that we are now living thank you very much"
