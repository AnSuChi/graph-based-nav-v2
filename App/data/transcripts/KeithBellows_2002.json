  "transcript": "the reason i put this up here is because when i was in africa my wife and i were driving around we had this wonderful guide who showed us something that surprised both of us and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination that comes with the design of animals it turns out that in about the 1880s the missionaries came to africa and they brought blackboards and chalk and i 'd like you to imagine that and and and that 's where the hyena comes in the hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world enables the hyena to essentially the end product of that action is up on the board here what the missionaries would do is they 'd walk around and the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great not what i 'm here to talk about but it is a fascinating when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about i had recently come back from jordan where i had an amazing experience with a camel and we were in the desert in a small jeep there were four of us two bedouin drivers and we were driving in what they told us was their very very best jeep didn 't look like it to me and as we started to go through the desert the jeep broke down the guys got out they put the hood up they started working under the hood and we just get out and walk and sure enough about half a mile we came over the crest of this hill and there was a huge gathering of bedouin with their camels the guy went up and started they went back up and the bedouin and they started slashing away at the back of the camels and they started galloping and if you 've ever been on a camel it is a very very uncomfortable ride they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg so we kept on going and this camel camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg and i 've developed a very and i 've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch and much meaner by the way than the bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell think we want to be bringing a camel and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel so i did the next best thing i want you to inspect its mouth look at its teeth go underneath it go above it i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can so i got a and it is a two thousand pound creature who is and if someone was smoking bedouin high grade so we got as close to it as possible and i 'm going to share this chris if you want to roll this film then i 'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels 're similar to seals in the way what i didn 't show you well and you 're glad i didn 't show you this one of the other things about the camel 's beautiful design and just whacker the entire what you also didn 't see was that and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and by the way the camel 's name is suki the pen beside him is jasmine jasmine has been his mate for some time but on this particular occasion it was very very clear that and so we started thinking well what would suki show you another film but before i do i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort the ship of the desert it 's so vital that there are one hundred and sixty words in arabic to describe and if this is a creature that was designed by committee it 's certainly been like no committee i 've ever been on so here 's here 's what suki would do in search of a mate can you roll it please we really don 't have to but this creature that you 've just seen ultimately adapts and keeps adapting and adapting i think when you look at the animal kingdom that is one of the most remarkable things it has to adapt to the environment ricky thank you very much for"
