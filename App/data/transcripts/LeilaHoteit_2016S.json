  "transcript": "who are these people it was an innocent question from my young daughter alia around the time when she was three was peering at a huge poster standing tall in the middle of the mall it featured the three rulers of the united arab emirates as she tucked in my side i bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the uae who had worked hard to develop their nation and preserve its unity where grandma and grandpa live we never see the pictures of powerful women on the walls is it because women are not important the younger of two daughters to a very hard working pilot and director of operations for the lebanese i to pursue our education even though our culture emphasized at the time i was one of very few girls of my generation who left home at eighteen to study abroad and so i in a sense and i hope i didn 't do too badly in making my father proud of his would be son i have never found a role model i could truly identify with my mother 's generation wasn 't into professional leadership pressures that got particularly acute when i had my own two beautiful children so arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models we have had to juggle more than arab men and we have had to face more cultural rigidity than western women lessons that might turn out useful for anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world and how do you develop it i believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel in my previous job i was working with a man we will call john writing passionately on the topic of women economic empowerment i got to present my research to a roomful of john was part of the audience listening for the first time to the details of my study as i proceeded with my presentation i could see john in the corner of my eye i finished my presentation to an applauding audience and we rushed out and jumped into the car there he exploded what you did up there was unacceptable you are a consultant not an activist i don 't understand yes we do happen to be today at the bottom of the index but what is it that i said or presented that to which he replied the whole premise of your study is wrong what you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society he paused then added when women have children their place is in the home time stood still for a long while and all i could think and repeat in the chaos of my brain was you can forget 's just never going to happen but once i did i reached three conclusions there may be many like him in our society but i would never let their issues become mine two that i needed another sponsor and fast i got one by the way and boy was he great and three that i would get to show john what women with children can do but i have also often been met by women men and couples who have clearly had an issue with my husband and i having chosen the path of a dual career couple so you get this well meaning couple who tells you straight out at a family gathering or at a friends gathering that come on you must know you 're not a great mom given how much you 're investing in your career right i would lie if i said these words didn 't hurt so instead the following sign in my mind 's eye [ be happy it drives people crazy ] you see as a young woman in these situations you have two options you can either decide to internalize these negative messages that are being thrown at you to let them make you feel like a failure like success is way too hard to ever achieve i have learned to always go for option two and i have found that it has taken me from strength to strength and it 's true what they say success is the best and even frowned upon as not very manly but it will take time for now it means that the professional arab woman has to somehow maintain the perfect home make sure that her children 's every need is being taken care of manage her demanding career the challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively just like i would in my business life cristina had worked for four years with my sister and the quality of her work was well established she is now an integral member of our family having been with us since alia was six months old she makes sure that the house is running smoothly while i 'm at work and i make sure to empower her just like i would my best talent at work and empower if you look at my calendar you will see this is sacred time i have done this ever since alia was a baby reading them a bedtime story and giving them lots of kisses and cuddles if i 'm traveling in whatever the time zone i use skype to connect with my children even if i am miles away i have found that our daughter is actually more successful at teaching him these skills than i am laughter it started as a game increase alia 's sense of responsibility and strengthen the bonding between them a win win all around the successful arab women i know have each found their unique approach to working their life as they continue to shoulder the lion 's share of responsibility in the home but this is not just about surviving in your dual role as a career woman and mother this is also about being in the present when i am with my children i try to leave work out of our lives instead of worrying about how many minutes i can spend with them every day hearing them connecting with them [ join forces don 't compete ] arab women of my generation have not been very visible in the public eye as they the upside of this however is that we have spent a lot of time developing a social skill behind the scenes the majority of those are also women it seems like ambitious women often compare themselves to other women hoping to be noticed as the most successful woman in the room this leads to the much less lift them up arab women generally all benefit so one could think that investing in my network of female colleagues couldn 't bring many benefits and that i should instead invest my time developing my relationships with male seniors and peers two of my biggest breaks came through the support of other women she was familiar with my media engagements and my publications and when she was asked to voice her opinion she highlighted my name it was a young consultant a saudi lady and friend who helped me sell my first project in saudi arabia a market i was finding hard to gain traction in as a woman she introduced me to a client and that introduction led to the first of very many projects for me in saudi and i see making them successful as key to my own success but we 're moving the is making progress despite many recent setbacks the uae appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet for a total of eight female ministers and more than many developed countries can claim this is today my daughter alia 's favorite picture but it is also the result of strong arab women not giving up and continuously pushing the boundaries it is the result arab women deciding every day like me as i look to the future my hopes for my daughter when she stands on this stage some twenty thirty years from now are that she be as proud to call herself her mother 's daughter as her father 's daughter my hopes for my son are that by then the expression her mother 's son or mama 's boy would have taken on a completely different meaning thank you"
