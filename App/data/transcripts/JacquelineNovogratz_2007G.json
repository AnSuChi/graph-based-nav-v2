  "transcript": "my first introduction ivory coast coast morning i had just cut my hair to look like margaret mead given away most everything that i owned and arrived with all the essentials some poetry a few clothes and of course a guitar but literally within days of arriving i was told in no uncertain terms by a number of west african women that africans didn 't want saving thank you very much least of all not by me i was too young and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening so i moved to kenya and and worked in uganda and i to move to kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there and i did and we ended up naming it duterimbere meaning to go forward with enthusiasm and while we were doing it i realized that there weren 't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women and so maybe i should try to run a business too and so i started looking around and i heard about a bakery that was run by twenty prostitutes and it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language and how what we call people so often distances us from them and makes them little i also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business that in fact it was a classic charity run by a six hundred dollars a month to keep these twenty women busy making little crafts and so i made a deal with the women i said look we get rid of the charity side and we run this as a business and i 'll help you i nervously started and of course things are always harder than you think they 're going to be first of all i thought well we need a sales team and we clearly so and the epitome was when i literally marched into the streets of nyamirambo which is the popular quarter of kigali with a bucket and i sold all these little doughnuts to people and i came back and i was like you see and the women said you know jacqueline who in nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an and they started listening to the marketplace and they came back with ideas for cassava chips and banana chips and sorghum bread and before you knew it we had cornered the kigali market and the women were earning three to four times the national your country not mine but they wouldn 't give me an answer so one week two weeks three weeks went by and finally i said well how about blue and they said blue blue we love blue let 's do it blue so i went to the store i brought gaudence the recalcitrant one of all and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains and on painting day we all gathered in nyamirambo and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim like a little french bakery but that was clearly not as satisfying as painting the walls were blue the windows were blue the sidewalk out front was painted blue franklin was shouting we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done and i said it is so beautiful and the women said it really is and i said and i think the color is perfect and they all nodded their head except for but that when you 've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long it 's really hard to say what you mean doing these two things and it was an extraordinary time in my life and it taught me three lessons that i think are so important for us today and certainly in the work that i do the first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth as eleni has said when people gain income they gain choice and that is fundamental to to dignity but as human beings we also want to see each other and we want to be heard by each other and we should never forget that the second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty i think andrew pretty well covered but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training and the management support the strategic advice and maybe most important of all on a micro level there 's a real role for this combination of investment and and on a macro level some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized but having had a father with heart disease and realizing that and having a good friend step in to help i really believe at prices they can afford i think the market can help us figure that out but there 's got to be a charitable component or i don 't think we 're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in it 's a nonprofit venture capital fund for the poor a few oxymorons in one sentence it essentially raises charitable funds from individuals foundations and corporations and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans in both for profit and nonprofit entities and have in so doing created nearly twenty thousand jobs and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service and both of them because they 're manufacturers create jobs directly and create incomes indirectly because they 're in the malaria sector and africa loses about thirteen billion dollars a year the first one it 's a company built in kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named patrick henfrey and his three colleagues these are old hand farmers who 've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in kenya over the last thirty years now this plant it 's the basic component for it 's indigenous to china and the far east because it 's a high using patient capital money that they could raise early on that actually got below market returns and was willing to go the long haul and be combined and i think some of you may have visited these farmers are helped by kickstart and technoserve who help them become again patient capital from novartis who has a real interest in getting the the powder acumen 's been working with both on and i really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so because the company was literally ten days away from proving that the product they produced and we called all of the social investors we know now some of these same social investors are really interested in africa and and understand the importance of we sometimes have this bifurcation between so acumen made not one but two bridge loans and the good news is they did indeed meet world quality classification and are now in the final stages of closing a 20 million dollar round to move it to the next level and i think that this will be one of the more important companies he was actually living in the kibera slums when his father called him and told him about artemisia samuel 's kids are in and he 's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into artemisia production dignity being more important the next one many of you know i talked about it a little at oxford two years ago and some of you visited a to z manufacturing which is one of the great real companies in east africa it 's another one that lives at the confluence of and this is really a story about a public private solution that has has really worked it started in japan sumitomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a fiber with organic insecticide so you could create a bed net a malaria bed net that would last five years and not need to be but like artemisia it had been produced only in east asia sumitomo said why don 't we experiment with whether we can produce it in africa for africans unicef came forward and said we 'll buy most of the nets and then we 'll give them away as part of the global fund 's and the u n ' s commitment to pregnant women and children for free came in with the patient capital and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in africa and exxon provided the initial resin well in looking around for entrepreneurs there was none better that we could find on earth than anuj shah in a to z manufacturing company it 's a 40 year old company it understands manufacturing it 's gone from socialist tanzania into capitalist tanzania and continued to flourish it had about one thousand and so anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to they 've been so successful in our first year the first net went went off the line in number was one hundred and fifty thousand nets a year this year they are now producing eight million nets a year and they employ five thousand people ninety percent of whom are women mostly unskilled and so from an enterprise perspective for africa and from a public health perspective but it 's only half the story if we 're really looking at solving problems of poverty 's a company with one big customer and if avian flu hits or for any other reason anuj and and acumen have been talking about testing the private sector because the assumption that the six dollars to produce these and it costs the the establishment another six dollars to distribute it so there 's another option let 's use the market as the best listening device we have and understand at what price people would pay for this so they get the dignity of choice we can start building local distribution and actually it can cost the public sector much less and so we came in with a second round of patient capital to a to z and found a number of things one that people will pay different prices but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net net and make a decision to buy it and when you listen to them they 'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don 't like and that so then from a policy perspective when you start with the market we can continue going along at twelve dollars a net or we could at least experiment with some of it to charge one dollar a net costing the public sector another six dollars a net we 've got to start having conversations whenever i go to visit a to z i think of my grandmother stella she didn 't have very much education she moved to the and they and she worked in a sewing machine shop making shirts for about ten cents an hour she like so many of the women i see at a to z worked and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams committed to service"
