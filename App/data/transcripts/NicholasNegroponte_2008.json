  "transcript": "it 's amazing when you meet a head of state and you say what is your most precious natural resource they will not say children at first and then when you say children they will pretty quickly agree with you traveling today with the minister of defense of colombia and we 're dropping off six hundred and fifty laptops today to children who have no television no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past the importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the farc the guerrillas that started off forty years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement and in some countries let me pick afghanistan seventy five percent of the little girls don 't go to school and i don 't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade they don 't go so in the three years since i talked at ted and showed a prototype it 's gone from an idea we have half a million laptops today in the hands of children we have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children so in rough numbers there are a million laptops that 's smaller than i predicted i predicted three to ten million but is still a very large number it 's the minister of defense with whom we 're working not the of education because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off in which the people who had been causing if you will forty years ' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived and suddenly they 've leapfrogged so yes they 're building roads yes they 're putting in telephone yes there will be television so the children grow up with access with a window into the rest of the world before they were closed off in other countries it will be the minister of finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth but it 's an important deeply economic and cultural change that happens through in uruguay will have a laptop a little green laptop now what are some of the results some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved probably the most important thing we see and so when i met with three children from the schools who had traveled all day to come to bogota one of the three children brought her mother and the reason she brought her mother is that this child had been teaching her mother how to read and write her mother had not gone to primary school and this is such an inversion and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of no this is an education project not a laptop project and then just think they can have let 's say one hundred books and so that village suddenly has ten thousand books you and i didn 't have ten thousand books when we went to primary school sometimes school is under a tree or in many cases the so we 're once again doing and by being a zero dollar laptop we can go to countries that can 't afford it at all ethiopia mongolia places that are not markets seeding it with the principles of saturation connectivity low and then we can actually roll out large numbers"
