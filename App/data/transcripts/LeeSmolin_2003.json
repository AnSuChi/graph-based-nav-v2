  "transcript": "three years ago i was in london and somebody called howard burton came to me and said i represent a group of people and we want to start an institute we want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done it took me about twenty five seconds to decide that that was a good idea three years later we have the perimeter institute for theoretical physics in waterloo most exciting job ive ever had and its the first time ive had a job where im afraid to go away because of everything thats going to happen in this week when im here but in any case what im going to do so we think a lot about what really makes science work the first thing that anybody who knows science and has been around science is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong somehow we manage to reason together as a community from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about and this is by the way something that a democratic society also has to do so how does it work my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics and here are some of the ethical principles im not going to read them all to you because im not in teacher mode im amaze mode but one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and but were all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide you know in thirty and fifty years so its this combination of respect for the tradition and community were in and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere that and being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions teaches us about democracy not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy but there has been historically a relationship between how people think about space and time and what the cosmos is and how people think about the society that they live in and i want to talk about three stages in that evolution the first science of cosmology that was anything like science was aristotelian science and and everything in this universe has a place and aristotles law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place which was of course the rule of the society that aristotle lived in and more importantly the medieval society through christianity embraced aristotle and blessed it where lives god who is the and in a certain sense medieval there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of newton and at the same time there was a revolution in social thought their way of thinking about space and time and let me show you in a newtonian universe theres no center thank you there are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed absolute framework of space and time its meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space because thats defined not with respect to say where other things are but with respect to this absolute notion of space which for newton similarly in lockes society there are individuals who have certain rights properties in a formal sense which are independent of what else has happened in the society of who else there is of the history and so forth because he has no role in anything that happens but is in a certain sense everywhere because space is just the way that god knows where everything is according to newton in the 20th century we had a revolution and which is still going on it was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory and merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity and in this universe theres nothing fixed and absolute zilch ok this universe is described by being a network of relationships space is just one aspect so theres no meaning to say absolutely where something is theres only where it is relative to everything else that is and this network your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations and theres no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making so this is so theres an interesting discussion going on there this last view of cosmology is called the relational which means that theres no place so in such a relational universe if you come upon something thats ordered and structured like this device here or that device there or something beautiful like all the living things all of you guys in the room guys in physics by the way is a you want to know youre a person you want to know how is it made and in a relational universe the only possible explanation was somehow it made itself there must be mechanisms of inside the universe that make things because theres no place to put a maker outside as there was in the so in a relational universe we must have processes of darwin taught us that there are processes of if you think about how natural selection works then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe that is natural selection so a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems and if you push that all the way down really it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational not only that but einstein taught us that gravity is the result of the world if it wasnt for gravity there wouldnt be life because gravity in the 20th century we saw the independent development of two big themes in science in the a self organized way that was the triumph of and so forth and slowly that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences the human sciences economics et cetera at the same time we physicists have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate and what weve been working out is the implications really of the idea that the universe is made up of relations the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world on the one hand and also is that in the 21st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology and our thinking about society are darwinism and relationalism if you think about democracy from this perspective a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests many different agendas many different individuals many each one is incomplete any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships and you understand some things better than other things and because of that theres a continual jostling and give and take which is politics and politics is in the ideal sense the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a"
