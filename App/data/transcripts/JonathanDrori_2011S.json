  "transcript": "how many species of flowering plants there are there are a quarter of a million at least those are the ones we know about a quarter of a million species of flowering plants and flowers are a real bugger they 're really difficult for plants to produce and the answer of course like so many things in the world is sex and the reason that sexual reproduction is so important there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce you can take cuttings they can sort of have sex with themselves they can pollinate themselves now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen some of you may have seen some of these pictures before as i say every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these and there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are and that 's actually rather useful for forensics and so on most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that and that 's a very inefficient process which is why it gets up our noses so much hoping that your will somehow reach another flower just all the grasses which means all of the cereal crops and most of the trees because the pollen they don 't need so much of it the insects and and other transfer it directly to it 's required so we 're aware obviously of the relationship between sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation the plant gets something plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way there are markings on many plants that look like other insects cleverly done so that when the the unsuspecting insect lands on it the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with and there 's an orchid that might look to you as if it 's got jaws and in a way it has it forces the insect to crawl out getting covered in in pollen that it takes somewhere else orchids there are twenty thousand at least species of orchids this orchid because it 's one that he he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it you can see that there 's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the from the orchid and basically what the insect has to do we 're in the middle of the flower it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar looking at this flower i guess something has coevolved with this and sure enough there 's the insect and i mean normally it kind of rolls it away but in its erect form that 's what it looks like now you can imagine that if a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators then just as in they might say i 've got a bit of nectar do you want to come and get it now this is a plant this is a plant here and this is the mimic so this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant and here is the long probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic because the the mimic doesn 't give it any nectar it thought it would get some so not only has the fly not got the the nectar from the mimic plant it 's also if you look very closely just at head end you can see that it 's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant if only some botanist hadn 't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card now deceit carries on through the the plant kingdom this flower with its black dots they might look like black dots to us but if i tell you to a male insect of the right species that looks like two females who are really really hot to trot you can see that there are actually and these electron microscope pictures here 's one of an orchid mimicking an insect you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye have very very different textures to what an insect might perceive and this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles and under the scanning the surface there really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at sometimes the whole plant it 's a wonderful amazing thing this one 's clever it 's called obsidian and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away and of course covers itself with pollen the other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects it 's deceiving on two levels fabulous here we see ylang ylang the component of many perfumes i actually smelt someone and they 're sending out a fantastic array of scent this is a flower that really really smells pretty nasty and is designed is also known as i don 't know what a dead horse actually smells like but this one probably smells and blowflies just can 't help themselves they fly into thinking it 's a nice bit of carrion but the plant meanwhile has benefited because the bristles release and the the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower fantastic here 's arum arum maculatum lords and ladies degrees above ambient temperature amazing and if you look down into it there 's this sort of dam past the spadix flies get attracted by the heat which is boiling off volatile chemicals little midges and they get trapped underneath in this they drink this fabulous nectar and then which showers down over them they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out covered in pollen now if you think that 's fabulous this is one of my great favorites this is the most amazing thing that sort of phallic bit there is about and it does something that no other and that is that when it flowers that 's the the spadix in the middle there for a period of about so instead of having starch which is the food of plants it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it 's burning fat metabolizing and that 's twice the energy output weight for weight than a hummingbird absolutely astonishing this thing but it keeps constant temperature now wouldn 't you know it there 's some beetles and they get inside and they get it all on the plant showers them with pollen and off they go and pollinate and what a wonderful thing it is now most pollinators that we are insects but actually in the tropics many birds and butterflies and that 's because but if you look at the spectrum birds and and us we see red green and blue and see that spectrum insects see green blue and ultraviolet they see various shades of ultraviolet so there 's something that goes on off the end there and wouldn 't it be great if we could somehow see what that is i hear you ask well yes we can so what is an insect seeing last week i took these pictures of rock rose helianthemum in dorset these are and this is what it looks like with visible light and then i put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light now we don 't know exactly what a bee sees we can 't know what 's going on in but the contrast will look something like that so standing out a lot from the background here 's another little flower different range of ultraviolet frequencies different filters to match the pollinators and that 's the sort of thing that it would be seeing just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property no no flower was damaged in the process of this shot it was just attached to the tripod not killed then under ultraviolet light look at that and that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light so maybe the chemical in that would be useful finally there 's one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me fantastic i think there 's something poetic here that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of venus actually the clouds of venus venus of course is the god of love and fertility they 've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth which when you think of it is the moment that encapsulates the the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another thank you very much"
