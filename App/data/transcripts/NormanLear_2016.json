  "transcript": "so i 've been tasked with starting with his bio which could easily take up the entire eighteen minutes so instead we 're born in new haven connecticut your father was a con man i got that right he was taken away to prison when you were nine years old you flew fifty two missions as a fighter pilot in world war ii you came back to operator eh but you hustled your way in your breakthrough your debut was a little show called all in the family you followed that up with a string of hits that to this day is unmatched in hollywood sanford and son all commercially not only are they all commercially you have seven shows in the top ten at one time at one point you aggregate an audience of one hundred and twenty million people per week watching your content that 's more than the audience for super bowl fifty which happens once a year nl holy shit eh and we 're not even to the holy shit part you land yourself on richard nixon 's enemies list he had one that 's an applause line too applause you 're inducted into the tv hall of fame on the first day that it exists then came the movies fried green tomatoes the princess bride stand by me this is spinal tap again just to name a fraction then you wipe the slate clean start a third act as a political activist focusing on protecting the first amendment and the separation of church and state you start people for the american way you buy the declaration of independence and give it back to the people you stay active in both entertainment and politics until the ripe old of age of ninety three when you write a book and make a documentary about your life story and after all that they finally think you 're ready for a ted talk my mother what a place to start let me put it this way when i came back from the war she showed me the letters that i had written her from overseas and they were absolute love letters this really sums up my mother they were love letters as if i had written them to they were love letters a year later i asked my mother she had thrown them away the best way i can sum it up in more recent times is this is also more recent times a number of years ago when they started the hall of fame to which you referred it was a sunday morning when i got a call from the fellow who ran the tv academy of arts & sciences he was calling me to tell me were going to start a hall of fame and these were the inductees greatest of the paddy chayefsky i think the best writer that ever came out of television milton berle lucille ball and me eh not bad nl i call my mother immediately in hartford connecticut mom this is what 's happened they 're starting a hall of fame i tell her the list of names and me and of a laugh because everybody has a piece of that mother eh and the sitcom jewish mother is born right there so your father also played a large role in your tell us what happened when you were nine years old nl he was flying to oklahoma with three guys that my mother said i don 't want you to have anything to do with them i don 't trust those men maybe not for the first time stifle yourself jeanette i 'm going and he went it turns out he was picking up some fake bonds but and he was going to bring me back a 10 gallon hat just like ken maynard my favorite cowboy you know this was a few years after lindbergh crossed the atlantic mean it was exotic that my father was going there but when he came back they arrested him as he got off the plane that night manacled to a detective and my mother was selling the furniture because we were leaving she didn didn 't want to stay in that state of shame in chelsea massachusetts and selling the furniture the house was loaded with people and in the middle of all of that some strange horse 's ass put his hand on my shoulder and said well you 're the man of the house now the man of the house now and i think that was the moment i began to understand the foolishness of the human condition so it but eh it 's interesting you benefit in that it gave me that springboard i mean that i could think how foolish it was to say to this crying nine year old boy you 're the man of the house now and then then i was crying and then he said and men of the house don and it 's been that gift that i 've used eh so you have a father who 's absent you have a mother for whom apparently nothing is good enough do you think that starting out as a kid who maybe never felt heard started you down a journey that ended with you being an adult with a weekly audience of one hundred and twenty million people nl i love the way you put that question because i guess i 've spent my life wanting to be heard i think it 's a simple answer yes that was what sparked i was fooling with a crystal radio set and i caught a signal that turned out to be father coughlin yeah somebody laughed but not funny this was who was very vocal about hating the new deal and roosevelt and jews the first time i ran into and that had an enormous effect on my life eh so you had a childhood with except for your grandfather tell us about him nl oh my grandfather well here 's the way i always talked about that lots of parades when i was a kid there were parades on veteran 's day there was abraham lincoln 's birthday george washington 's birthday and he meant a great deal to me and he used to write presidents of the united states every letter and i would run down the stairs every now and then and pick up the mail we were three flights up story i have told about my grandfather eh they wrote him back on the envelopes nl they wrote back but i i have shown them going way back to phil donahue and and others before him literally dozens of interviews in which i told that story this will be the second time the truth is a tear came down his eye the truth is he would write an occasional letter and i did pick up those little envelopes but my dearest darling mr president a story i borrowed from a good friend whose grandfather was that when i started to write my memoir even this how about that even this i get to experience when i started to write the memoir and i started to think about it i so much so the word father i have six kids by the way my favorite role in life but i stole the man 's identity because i needed the father now i 've gone through a whole lot of shit and come out on the other side and i forgive my father the best thing i the worst thing i the word i use about him and think about him is he was a rascal the fact that he lied and stole and cheated i submerge that in the word rascal eh well there 's a saying that amateurs quote is widely attributed to john lennon but it turns out he stole it from t s eliot so you 're in good company i want to talk about your work obviously the impact of your work has been written about and i 'm sure you 've heard about it all your life what it meant to people what it meant to our culture you heard the applause when i just named the names of the shows raised half the people in the room through your work but have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work that surprised you nl oh god there was an evening with norman russell simmons was among seven on the stage the show that was a number five show he was talking about a simple thing that made a big eh an impact on him i was hesitating over the word change it 's hard for me to imagine you know changing somebody 's life but that 's the way he put it he saw george jefferson write a check on the jeffersons and it just impacted his life so it changed his life and when i hear things like that little things because i i know that there isn 't anybody in this audience that wasn 't likely responsible today for some little thing they did for somebody it could have been been the the dresser of the set who put the checkbook on the thing and george had nothing to do while he was speaking so he wrote it i don 't know but eh so in addition to the long list i shared in the beginning i should have also mentioned that you invented and all of us strive to do both of those things not all of us manage to you managed to push culture forward through your art while also achieving world beating commercial success how did you do both nl here 's where my mind goes when i hear that recitation of all i accomplished in a universe of which there are billions billions of universes billions of planets which we 're trying to save and it requires saving but anything i may have accomplished is my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in newington connecticut and i said write your alderman or your mayor or something she said well i 'm not norman lear i 'm claire lear and that was the first time i said what i 'm saying i said claire with everything you think about what i may have done and everything you 've done she never left newington can you get your fingers close enough when you consider the size of the planet and so forth to measure anything i may have done to anything you may have done so i am convinced we 're all responsible for doing as much as i may have accomplished to really buy into the size and scope of the creator 's enterprise here eh but here on this planet you have really really mattered nl i 'm a son of a gun eh so i have one more question for you how old do you feel years old but i hope to one day feel as young as the person i 'm sitting across from ladies and gentlemen the incomparable norman lear"
