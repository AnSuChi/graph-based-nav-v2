  "transcript": "let 's say you despise western democracy endless debates about the proper too unpredictable too constraining for your taste and the way these democracies band together and lecture everyone else about you can call out the hypocrisy and failures of western democracies and explain how your way is better but that 's never really worked for you what if you could get the people whose support is the very foundation of these democracies to start questioning the system make the idea occur in their own minds that democracy and its institutions are failing them their elite are corrupt puppet masters and the country they knew is in free fall to do that infiltrate the information spheres of these democracies you 'll need to turn their most powerful asset an open mind now you 'll be familiar of hacking and leaks that happened in two thousand and aggressively pushed news of these leaks to journalists the media took the bait they were consumed by how much the dnc hated at the time it was that narrative that far outshined the news that a group of russian government sponsored hackers who we called advanced persistent threat for short was carrying out these operations against the us and there was no shortage of evidence this group of russian government hackers hadn 't just appeared out of nowhere in two thousand and sixteen we had started tracking this group back in used to compromise its victims ' networks demonstrated a thoughtful well resourced effort that had taken place for now over a decade in moscow 's time zone from about nine am to six pm apt28 loved to prey on the emails and contacts of journalists all targets with an undeniable interest to the russian government we weren 't the only ones onto this governments research teams across the world were coming to similar conclusions and observing the same types of operations but what russia was doing in two thousand and sixteen went far beyond espionage the dnc hack was just one of many where stolen data was posted online accompanied by a sensational narrative then amplified in social media for lightning speed adoption by the media this didn 't ring the alarm bells that was trying to interfere with the credibility of another 's internal did we not see this coming why did it take months before americans understood that they were under a the obama administration was caught in a perfect catch 22 by raising the specter that the russian government was interfering in the us presidential campaign the administration risked appearing to meddle but the better answer i think is that the us and the west were utterly unequipped to recognize and respond to a modern information operation despite the fact that the us had wielded information so while the us and the which infrastructure to deem critical how to set up armies of cyber warriors and cyber commands before the first iphone even hit the shelf the russian government understood the risks and the opportunity that technology provided and as our realities are increasingly based on the information that we 're consuming at the palm of our hand and from the news feeds that we 're scanning and the hashtags and stories that we see trending the russian government was the first to recognize how this evolution had turned your mind and your mind is particularly exploitable if you 're accustomed to an unfettered flow of information this panorama of information that 's so interesting to you gives a state or anyone for that matter a perfect back door into your mind it 's this new brand of state sponsored information operations that can be that much more successful more insidious and harder for the target audience that includes the media or chum the waters with or drive journalists to dissect terabytes of email for a cent of impropriety all tactics used in russian operations then you 've got a shot at effectively camouflaging your operations in the mind of your target this is what russia 's long called reflexive control it 's the ability to use information on someone else so that they make a decision on their own accord that 's favorable to you this image control and perception management and it 's conducted by any means with any tools network based or otherwise that will achieve it take this for another example in early february two thousand and fourteen a few weeks before russia would invade crimea a phone call is posted on youtube in it there 's two us diplomats they sound like they 're playing kingmaker in ukraine and worse they curse the eu for its lack of speed and leadership in resolving the crisis the media covers the phone call and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash leaves washington it creates a fissured the real operations are the ones all in the service of and this information is all that much more seductive all that much easier to take at face value and pass on when it 's authentic who 's not interested in the truth that 's presented in phone calls and emails that were never intended for public but how meaningful is that truth if you don 't know why it 's being revealed to you which we 've quaintly termed cyberspace isn 't defined by ones and zeroes but by information and the people behind it this is a network composed of minds interacting with computers and devices and for this network there 's no encryption there 's no firewall no two factor authentication no password complex enough to protect you what you have for defense is far stronger it 's more adaptable it 's always running the latest version press for the facts and above all you must have the courage to unflinchingly pursue the truth"
