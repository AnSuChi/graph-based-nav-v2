  "transcript": "muslim female like all of you and i 'm also a social justice comedian something that i insist is an actual job to explain what it 's got breathtaking nature waffle houses and diabetes as far as the eye can see it is really something besides florida the most troubling category here are the haters they are a minority but they overcompensate by being extra as a social justice comedian it 's my goal to convert these haters because they hate a lot of things which leads to negative outcomes like racism violence and ted nugent the point is i put them in a petri dish like a scientist and this is what i found they 're the people who quit their jobs so they can post on youtube videos all day long there 's also the these people will be at a stoplight they 'll wait for the light to turn green and when it does they yell go back to your own country now back in the day they would 've actually gotten out of their cars and hated you to your face but they just don 't make them like they used to which is another sign of the decline in america they 're like ideological sluts because on a scale the average american prefers comedy as you can see from this graph and in that moment of openness a good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information and if they 're really skilled a rectal exam first off it 's not partisan this isn 't political comedy this is about justice and no one is against justice it 's inviting and warm it makes you feel like you 're sitting inside of a burrito three a few years ago i rounded up a bunch of muzzies and we did stand up shows we called the tour the muslims are coming and then after the movie came out a known hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti muslim poster campaign with the mta that 's the new york city subway system now the posters were truly offensive not to mentioned poorly designed i mean if you 're going to be bigoted you might as well use a better font but we decided why not launch our own poster campaign that says nice things about muslims while promoting the movie so myself and fellow comedian dean obeidallah decided to launch the mta for over five months got the posters approved and two days after they were supposed to go up the mta decided to ban the posters citing political content let 's take a look at a couple of those posters here 's one fact grown up muslims so what i 'm saying is a couple of dirt bag comedians took on a major new york city agency and the comedians won thank you victory was a very weird feeling i was like is this what blonde girls feel like all i 'm asked everywhere i go why don 't muslims denounce terrorism we do but ok i 'll take the bait so i decided to launch it 's a website that denounces terrorism every day of the week while taking the weekends off let 's take a look single panel cartoons i denounce terrorism i also denounce people who never fill the paper tray the point of the website is that it the united states something like three hundred billion dollars a year in these offshore tax havens not to brag but at the end of every month i have something like 5 15 dollars in disposable income so we walked into these banks in the cayman islands and asked if we could open up a bank account with eight dollars and twenty seven cents laughter the bank managers would indulge us for 30 45 seconds before calling security security would come and then we would squeal with fear and run away because and this is the last rule of social justice comedy sometimes it makes you want to take a dump in your pants sometimes i get mean tweets and hate mail sometimes i get voice mails saying that if i continue and those death threats are definitely not funny we 've tried a lot of approaches to social justice like war and competitive ice dancing but still thank you"
