  "transcript": "i 'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today about what i consider to be a parachute jump from the very edge of space more about that a bit later on what i 'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they 've ever been before i 've been a professional stunt man for thirteen years i 'm a stunt we can 't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set or any passerby so safety hanging famously from the clock hands rosie venger an amazing woman you can see from the slide very very strong she really paved the way at time when nobody was doing stunts let alone women this is a screen capture from stagecoach where yakima canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts i 've ever seen there is no safety no back support no pads no crash mats no sand pits in the ground some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts we couldn 't do them without technology these are particularly dangerous because there is no mask on my face they were done for a photo shoot one for the sun newspaper one for fhm magazine highly dangerous but also you 'll notice it doesn 't look as though i 'm the fire suits of old the bulky suits the thick woolen suits have been replaced with modern materials like nomex or more recently carbonex fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals to burn for longer look more spectacular and in pure safety here 's a bit more giving me what for one of the things that a stuntman often does and you 'll see it every time in the big movies is be blown through the air it 's a frightening piece of equipment when you step on it either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot it will fire you depending on the gas pressure anything from five feet to thirty feet i could quite literally fire myself into the gallery which i 'm not today car stunts are another area we can do bigger car stunts than ever before now being run over is never easy that shock absorbing things like sorbothane the materials that help us when we 're hit like this not to hurt ourselves too much and testing breakaway signpost pillars a company makes a lattix pillar which is a network a lattice type pillar that collapses when it 's hit and we still do sometimes anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power laughs it 's a great job really it 's such fun you should hear some of the phone conversations that i have with people on my bluetooth in the shop well we can flip the bus over we can have it burst into flames and how about someone you know big explosion and people are looking like this i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are the next thing that i 'd like to show you is something that dunlop asked me to do earlier this year with our channel five 's fifth gear show a loop the loop biggest in the world only one person had ever done it before now the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be let 's hit this as fast as possible sixty miles an hour let 's just go for it foot flat to the floor and spoke to even then i caught seven g and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in that 's a long way to fall if you get it wrong that was just about right so again science helps us and with the engineering too they 're old fashioned stunts what 's interesting about high falls is that although we use airbags and some airbags are quite advanced that 's all it is they 're great for catching you up to certain heights and on the other side of the fence the physical performance of the stuntman has interfaced with the very highest technology and in software not the cardboard box but the green screen this is a shot of terminator the movie two stunt guys doing what i consider to be a rather benign stunt it 's thirty feet it 's water it 's very simple moving and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image decelerator rigs and wires we use them a lot and this is a guinness world record attempt they asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in two thousand and four and again technology meant that i could do the fastest abseil over and that 's centre point in london helicopter stunts are always fun and aerial stunts no aerial stunt would be the joseph kittenger of the united states air force and he did it to test high altitude systems and i 'd just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then and just how brave he was in they first dropped some dummies big gas balloon it 's that shape because the helium has to expand my balloon will expand to five hundred times and look like a big pumpkin when it 's at the top these are the dummies being dropped from one hundred thousand feet and there is the camera that 's strapped to them which is about twenty two miles you 're in a near vacuum in that environment he didn 't know if he would live or die this is an extremely brave man saying if you get this thing off the ground i wish you all the best and he signed it happy landings which i thought was quite lovely he this is him in a pressure suit now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to thirty thousand feet when you get to thirty thousand feet pushing him in those turned up jeans you need a pressure suit you need a above fifty certainly at one hundred thousand feet no aircraft will fly not even and two balloons for the main jump because they notoriously tear he 's written on that thing the highest step in the world and what must that feel like and this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled before his drogue chute opened to i did quite a lot of research and you 'll see in a second there he comes back down to the floor that 's the u s air force museum this is what the view is going to be like at ninety thousand feet for me now you may think this is just well there 's a little bit more to it than that trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that i never really expected when i set about doing this i contacted a company in the states or someone that will make one something revolutionary happened a little while ago that 's the prototype of the parachute i 've now had them custom make one the only one of its kind in the world and that 's the only suit of its kind in the world it was made by a russian that 's designed most of the suits of the past he left the company because he saw as some other people in the space suit industry emerging market for space suits for space tourists you know if you are in an aircraft at thirty thousand feet and the cabin depressurizes you can have oxygen if you 're at one hundred thousand feet you die and then if the cabin depressurizes thank you costa this is the communication headset you 'll see on on lots of of space suits nasa suits have got thirteen layers costa thank you very much and which means that i can practice everything i need to practice in safety before i ever jump out of anything thanks very much costa"
