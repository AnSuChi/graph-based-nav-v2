  "transcript": "this machine which we all have residing in our skulls reminds me of an aphorism of and it 's constructed for isn 't she fabulous but nonetheless when she popped out despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing in its development for several months before on the basis of her experiences in the womb nonetheless she had very limited abilities as does every infant at the time if we were to assay her perceptual abilities they would be crude there is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability there is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on and they can only in a very primitive way and in a very limited way control their movements it would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it usually to the mouth and it will be some months beforeward and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles standing walking before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world and yet when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance by this age the brain can actually store it has stored recorded can fastly retrieve tens of thousands of objects actions and their relationships in the world and those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of potentially millions of ways by this age and by this age there is absolutely no question and in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self development and by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously and where this boy comes from sao paulo brazil about forty percent of boys of his age have this ability you could go out into the community in monterey and you 'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability and if you did he 'd probably be from sao paulo that 's all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments the thing our brain is challenged with because what we 've done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to and in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind in the way that in fact no two of us are quite alike every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine in an adult brain of course we 've built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory and that define us as acting moving thinking laboratory university based scientists that we are or monkeys or of this particularly curious creature one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth to engage in fact we do this in individuals infancy up to adulthood and old age so we might engage a rat for example to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub skills or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance from these studies we defined two great epochs the first great epoch is commonly called the critical period and that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery this is actually a period of dramatic change all it takes for example in the sound domain is exposure to and the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared so for example i can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound a repertoire of sound that i make up that i make just by exposure artificially important to the animal and what i see is that the animal 's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that 's idealized within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way the sound doesn 't have to be valuable to the animal i could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child and i see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized or i can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound i can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan in the presence of continuous noise and when i do that i actually specialize the brain and i frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies and so they also account for development of defective processing now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context the input doesn 't really have to be meaningful i don 't have to be in a behavioral context this is required so the brain sets up it 's processing so that it can act selectively so that the creature that that wears it that carries it can begin to operate on it in a selective way in the next great epoch of life which applies for most of life the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities and in this epoch which extends from late in the first year of life and it 's focusing on skill after skill or ability after ability under specific attentional control it 's a function this is actually very powerful this lifelong capacity for plasticity for brain change is powerfully expressed it is the basis of our real differentiation one individual from another and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels so here is a very simple experiment it was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the university of provence in marseilles it 's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that 's equivalent in its difficulty to to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon so in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all it had a success rate of about one in eight tries tries and seven hundred or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly never fails he 's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time at this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped very beautifully regulated and highly repeated trial to trial and we see that it 's distorted we can track these changes and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time and here we see now this is a map down in the surface of the brain in which in a very elaborate experiment we 've reconstructed the responses location in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons we see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain we 've actually distorted the map by the exercise and that is indicated in the pink we have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger these are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool if we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body monkey has like you have and that is an unknown unsuspected maybe by you now actually we 've looked in different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task and each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability so for example we can look to the cortical area we look in cortical areas that control specific movements and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior and so forth they are all remodeled they all become specialized for the task at hand there are fifteen or twenty cortical that are changed specifically possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain this is constructed by physical change the changes are massive what it 's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the it 's what the brain regards itself as positive and important to you and that underlies your specialization that is why you in your many skills and abilities are a unique specialist a specialist that 's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual one hundred years ago enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual one thousand years ago now one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring and that 's because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time the brain is recording all information and driving all change now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that 's occurred in your brain is you billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver and that result in the embodiment of you you are constructed your self is constructed and it 's created in the brain via physical this is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form now we 've used this research to try to understand but also try to understand and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child or an adult i 'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and then by using it in a targeted approach we 're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age so the first example i 'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments we now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments and that are going to struggle to learn to read is that their language processor is created in a defective form and the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby 's brain 's life it 's that simple signal to noise problem and there are a lot of things that contribute to that there are numerous inherited faults that could make the machine process noisier now i might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided if any those of you who are older in the audience know that when i was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read that no that inherited weakness that inherited condition we don 't hear about that anymore where did it go well it was understood by a dutch surgeon about thirty five years ago that if you simply fix the problem early enough when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately in this initial set up time in the critical period what are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it you 're basically opening up the tubes that drain which have had them reliably full and then the child is stuck with it and the native language for a child with such a brain it 's noisy english and that results in defective representations of sounds of words not normal a different strategy by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants and you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants they are about an order of magnitude longer about eleven times longer in duration on average than in a normal child space constants are about three times greater such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain of course they will because as a receiver of language they are receiving it and representing it and in information it 's representing because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orthographic or visual and you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology then these children increasingly the point is is that you can train the brain out of this a way to think about this is you can actually re refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it and we 've accomplished that in about four hundred and thirty thousand kids today probably about fifteen thousand children are being trained as we speak what we 're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution this is from about three thousand children you can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right we have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side in addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production and an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training that is to say reading and to a large extent it fixes the brain you can look down in the brain of a child and ucsf and ucla and a number of other you see for the most extent for most children their neuronal responses complexly abnormal before you start are normalized by the training now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging where again the machinery is deteriorating and learning modulation and control is deteriorating and you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which for example the brain is representing language again it 's going back into chaos in the end this results in declines in memory and in postural ability and agility turns out you can train the brain of such an individual this is a small population of such individuals train equally intensively for about thirty hours these are and what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory of their ability to remember things after a delay the overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population that means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution and i 'm looking at your the average person has moved my issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers because i think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale and in older age conditions like parkinsonism and"
