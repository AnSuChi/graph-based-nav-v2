  "transcript": "my office i keep a small clay pot that i made in college it 's raku which is a kind of pottery that began in japan centuries ago as a way of making bowls for the japanese tea ceremony each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay and it was the imperfections that people cherished everyday pots like this cup take eight to ten hours i just took this out of the kiln last week and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down but raku is really fast you do it outside and you take and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside you can see that faint sheen you turn the kiln off and you reach in with these long metal tongs you grab the pot and in japan this red hot pot would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea and you can imagine what that steam would smell like and you put it on i would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke i love raku because it allows me to play with the elements i can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze but then i have to let it go to the fire and the smoke and what 's wonderful is the surprises that happen like this crackle pattern because it 's really stressful on these pots they go from hundred degrees raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity i find in so many things that tension between what i can control whether i 'm creating a new radio show or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons when i sat down to write a book about creativity i realized that the steps were reversed i had to let go at the very beginning and i had to immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers i realized that including letting go it was supposed to break but that 's okay that 's part of the letting go is sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn 't because creativity also grows from the broken places best way to learn about anything and so i want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace the first embrace is something that we think this is very easy but it 's actually getting harder and that 's paying attention to the world around us so many artists speak about needing to be open to embrace experience and that 's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus the filmmaker mira nair speaks about growing up in a small town in india the major thing that inspired me that led me on this path that made me a filmmaker eventually was traveling folk that would come through the town and i would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of you after seeing that jatra the folk theater you can see the sort of break in the everyday there they are in the school fields but it 's good and evil and passion and hashish and it led her as she said down this path to become an award winning filmmaker so being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embrace artists also speak about how the novelist richard ford speaks about a childhood challenge that he 's severely dyslexic richard ford i was slow to learn to read went all the way through school not really reading more than the minimum and still to this day can 't read silently much faster than i can read aloud but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me because when i finally did reconcile myself to how slow i was going to have to do it then i think i came very slowly the syncopations the sounds of words what words look like and as i did lingering on those sentences as i had to linger i fell heir to language 's other qualities which i think has helped me write sentences jb it 's so powerful richard ford who 's won the pulitzer prize says that dyslexia helped him write sentences he had to embrace this challenge and i use that word intentionally he didn 't have to overcome dyslexia he had to learn to hear the music in language artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do sometimes pushing into what they can 't do helps them focus on finding their own voice the sculptor richard serra and he lived in florence after graduate school while he was there he traveled to madrid where he went to the prado to see this picture by the spanish painter diego velzquez it 's from one thousand six hundred and fifty six and it 's and it 's the picture of a little princess and her and reflected in it are her parents the king and queen of spain who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture he 's i was to the point where i was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of randomness and i wasn 't getting anywhere so i went back and dumped all my paintings in the arno and i thought i 'm going to just start playing around richard serra says that so nonchalantly you might have missed it he went and saw this painting by a guy who 'd been dead for three hundred years and realized i can 't do that and so richard serra went back to his studio in florence picked up all of his work up to that point and threw it in a river he moved to new york city and he put together a list of verbs and as he said he just started playing around he did these things to all kinds of material he would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it richard serra had to let go of painting in order to embark on this playful exploration huge curves of steel that require our time and motion to experience so experience and challenge and it 's the hardest it 's the embrace of loss the oldest and most constant of human experiences in order to create we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for looking squarely at rejection at heartbreak at war at death that 's a tough space to stand in the educator parker palmer calls it the tragic gap tragic not because it 's sad but because it 's inevitable and my friend dick nodel likes to say you can hold that tension like a violin string and make something beautiful that tension resonates in the work of the photographer joel meyerowitz who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography for capturing a moment on the street and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes of tuscany of cape cod of light joel is a new yorker and his studio for many years was in chelsea you know where this story goes and raced down to the site of the destruction i stood outside the chain link fence on chambers and greenwich and all i could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble and i raised my camera to take a peek just to see if there was something to see and some cop and said hey no pictures and it was such a blow that it woke me up in the way that and when i asked her why no pictures she said it 's a crime scene no photographs allowed and i asked her what would happen if i was a member of the press and she told me and back a block was the press corps tied up and i said well when do they go in and she said probably never probably from the blow because it was an insult in a way i thought find a way to get in because i don 't want to see this history disappear jb looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night my office was just a few blocks away and we wondered was it difficult for joel meyerowitz to make such beauty powerful and tragic and horrific and everything but it was also and i found myself recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature as time is erasing this wound and it 's i 'm really a realist the reality is there 's the woolworth building in a veil of smoke but it 's now like a scrim across a and it 's turning pink you know and down below there are hoses spraying and the lights have come on for the evening and the water is turning acid green because the and i 'm thinking is i 'm there it looks like that you have to take a picture jb you have to take a picture that sense of urgency of the need to get to work is so powerful in joel 's story when i saw joel meyerowitz recently i told him how much i admired his passionate obstinacy his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work but i think what 's more important is my passionate optimism and i 'm not an artist limits and loss whether we 're scientists or teachers"
