  "transcript": "'s actually almost twenty years ago when i wanted to reframe the way we use information the way we work together i invented the world wide web now twenty so going back to one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine i wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system nobody really did anything with it pretty much but eighteen months later this is this is how innovation happens eighteen months later my boss said i could do it on the side as a sort of a play kick the tires of a new computer we 'd got and so he gave me the time so i basically roughed out what html should look like well it was basically frustration i was working as a software engineer in this huge very exciting lab lots of people coming from all over the world they brought all sorts of different computers with them they had all sorts of different data formats all sorts all kinds of documentation systems so that in all that diversity if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this everything i looked into i had to connect to some new machine i had to learn to run some new program i would find the information i wanted in some new data format and these were all incompatible in fact on all these discs there were documents virtual documentation system in the sky say on the internet then life would be so much easier he had written vague but exciting in pencil in the corner when ted started web so things like click didn 't have the same meaning i can show somebody a piece of hypertext a page which has got links and we click on the link and bing there 'll be another hypertext page not impressive you know we 've seen that we 've got things on hypertext on cd roms what was difficult was to get them to imagine imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine alright that is the leap so yeah it was difficult to explain but there was a grassroots movement sending the emails that 's what it was like then funny but right now it 's kind of like that again i asked everybody more or less to put their documents i said could you put your documents on this web thing and it 's been a blast hasn 't it i mean it has been quite interesting because we 've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away they 're much more than we 'd originally imagined when we turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential there is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven 't got data on the web who was here or has otherwise seen hans rosling 's talk one of the great yes a lot of people have seen it one of the great ted talks hans put up this presentation in which he showed for various different countries in various different colors he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality and he shot this thing animated through time so he 'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world he put up a slide a little bit like this it had underground all the data ok data is brown and boxy and boring and that 's how we think of it isn 't it because data you can 't naturally use by itself but in fact data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it in this case hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of united nations websites and things combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he 'd put it into this this wonderful presentation and hans made a point of saying look it 's really important to have a lot of data and i was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying very forcibly it 's really important to have a lot of data so i want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected or six like the technology is linked data and it 's extremely simple if you want to put something on the web there are three rules first thing is that those http names those things that start with we 're using them not just for documents now we 're using them for things that the documents we 're using them for events all kinds of conceptual things they have names now that start with http second rule i will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to third rule is that when i get back that information this person was born in berlin berlin is in germany and when it has relationships expresses a relationship then the other thing that it 's related to is given so i can go ahead and look that thing up so i look up a person i can look up then the city where they were born then i can look up the region it 's in and the town it 's in and the population of it and so on so i can browse this stuff so that 's it really that is linked data wrote an article entitled linked data a couple of years ago and soon after that things started to happen it 's not just a whole lot of other plants it 's not just a root supplying a plant but for each of those plants whatever it is a presentation an analysis somebody 's looking for patterns in the data they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together the more powerful it is the meme went out there and pretty soon chris bizer at the freie universitat in berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up he noticed that wikipedia you know wikipedia the online encyclopedia with in those documents and put it into a blob of linked data on the web which he called dbpedia dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up berlin and let 's think about data for a we could talk about government data enterprise data is really there 's weather data there 's data about events there 's data about talks and there 's news and there 's so that you also see how much barack obama said in a speech that he but that data this is the data from all the government departments think about how much of that data i could use it as a kid to do my homework so we 're talking about making the place making the world run better by making this data available in fact if you 're responsible if you know about some data in a government department often you find that these very tempted to keep it hans calls it database hugging you hug your database you don 't want to let it go until you 've made a beautiful website for it well i 'd like to suggest that rather yes make we and it 's not just governments of course it 's enterprises as well understanding how the world they try to communicate those over the web but a lot of the state of knowledge of the human because they had their genomics data in one database in one building and they had their protein data in another now they are sticking it onto linked data and now they can ask the sort of question that you probably wouldn 't ask i wouldn 't ask they would you take that mouthful and you put it into google of course there 's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before you get two hundred and twenty three thousand hits no results you can use you ask the linked data which they 've now put together thirty two hits each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at the power of being able to ask those questions as a scientist questions which actually bridge across different disciplines is really a complete sea change it 's very very important totally stymied at the moment the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems now if i go on like this you 'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions data is about our lives you just you log on to your social networking site your favorite one you say this is my friend bing relationship data you say this photograph it 's about it depicts this person bing that 's data the social networking site is taking data and using it re purposing it and using it to make other people 's lives and you say to send this photo to all the people in that group you can 't get over the walls the economist wrote an article about it and lots of people have blogged about it tremendous frustration the way to break down the silos one last type of data i 'll talk about maybe it 's the most exciting before i came down here i looked it up on openstreetmap the openstreetmap 's a map but it 's also a wiki zoom in and that square thing is a theater which we 're in right now and i could save it back and now if you go back to the i just did that i put that up on there hey you know and that is what linked data is all about it 's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit and it all connecting that 's how linked data works you do your bit everybody you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it and we 've practiced that so linked data it 's huge i 've only told you a very small number of things and it 's not just about the number of places where data you get power in a way that doesn 't happen just with the web with documents you get this really huge power out of it so we 're at the stage now where we have to do this the people who think it 's a great idea and all the people and i think there 's a lot of people at ted who do things because even though there 's not an immediate return because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it they 'll do it because they 're the sort of person who just does things i want you to make it i want you to demand it and i think it 's an idea worth spreading"
