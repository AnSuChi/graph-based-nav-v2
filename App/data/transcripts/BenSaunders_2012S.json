  "transcript": "take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually but i 'm going to read this question from does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving achieving after all if it is being done somewhere by someone and we can participate virtually then why bother leaving the house i 'm usually introduced as a polar explorer i 'm not sure that 's the most progressive or 21st century of job titles but i 've spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the arctic circle so i get out of the house a fair and in my nature i guess i am a doer of things more than i am a spectator or a contemplator of things and it 's that the gulf between ideas and action that i 'm going to try and explore briefly the pithiest answer to the question why that 's been dogging me for the last twelve years was credited certainly to this chap the second from the left george lee mallory many of you will know his name in one thousand nine hundred and twenty four he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of mt everest he may or may not have been the first person to climb everest more than thirty years before edmund hillary no one knows if he got to the top i 'm not actually sure that he did say that there 's very little evidence to suggest it but what he did say is actually far nicer and again i 've printed this i 'm going to read it out the first question which you will ask there is not the slightest prospect of any and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation but otherwise nothing will come of it we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver and not a gem nor any coal or iron we shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food so it is no use if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward then you won 't see why we go after all is the end of life we don 't live to eat and make money we eat and make money to be able to enjoy life and that is what life is for mallory 's argument that the furthest i 've ever got away from my front door was in the spring of two thousand and four i still don 't know exactly what came over me but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the arctic ocean i planned essentially i was twenty six at the time a lot of experts were saying it was impossible and my mum certainly wasn 't very keen on the idea the journey from a small weather station on the north coast of siberia up to my final starting point the edge of the pack ice the coast of the arctic ocean took about five hours and if anyone watched fearless felix baumgartner the sense of apprehension as i sat in a helicopter thundering north there was a bit of fun a bit of joy i was remember sitting there looking down at my sledge i had my skis ready to go i had a satellite phone part of me felt quite proud of myself but mostly i was just utterly terrified we took this photo next to the helicopter beyond that i didn 't see anyone for ten weeks nasa described conditions that year as the worst since records began i the average temperature for the ten weeks was minus thirty five minus fifty was the coldest so again there wasn 't an awful lot of of joy or fun to be had one of the magical things about this journey however is that because i 'm walking over the sea over this floating drifting shifting crust of ice that 's floating on top of the arctic ocean is it 's an environment that 's in a constant state of flux the ice is always moving breaking up drifting around refreezing so the scenery that i saw for nearly three months was unique to me no one else will ever could ever possibly see i was the only human being in five point therefore that the doing you know to try rather than to watch and to wonder that 's where the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days and i would add a cautionary note here however in my experience there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what 's humanly possible now i don 't just mean in the field of daft macho edwardian style derring do but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer there is something addictive about this and in my case i think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit i can 't explain quite how good it is until you 've tried it but it has the capacity to to burn up all the money i can get my hands on to ruin every relationship i 've ever had so be careful what you wish for mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain and i wonder if that 's the case whether there 's something in the in the challenge itself in the endeavor and particularly in the and in my experience that 's certainly the case there is one unfinished challenge that 's been calling out to me for most of my adult life many of you will know the story this is a photo of captain scott and his team scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the south pole no one knew what was it was utterly unmapped at the time we knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of antarctica scott as many of you will know was beaten to it by roald amundsen and his norwegian team who used dogs and dogsleds scott 's team were on foot all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges and they arrived at the pole to find the norwegian flag already there there is a sort of misconception nowadays that it 's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure when i talk about antarctica people often say no one has ever walked from the very coast of antarctica to the south pole and back again it is arguably the most audacious endeavor of that edwardian golden age of exploration and it seemed to me high time given everything we have figured out in the century since from from scurvy to solar panels that it was high time someone someone had a go at finishing the job so that 's precisely what i 'm setting out to do this time next year in october i 'm leading a team of three will take us about four months to make this return journey that 's the scale the red line is is obviously halfway to the pole we have to turn around and come back again i 'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting you 'll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever finally come up with a a pithy answer to the question"
