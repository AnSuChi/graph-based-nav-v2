  "transcript": "i think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been what 's changed is and see what inequality does i 'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links but first see what a miserable lot we are i want to start though with a this shows you life expectancy against gross national income how rich countries are on average but if we look within the richest on the left and nothing between them the explanation of that paradox is that within our societies we 're looking at relative income or social position social status where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us and as soon as you 've got that idea you should immediately what happens if we widen the differences or compress them make the income differences bigger or smaller and that 's what i 'm going to show you i because it 's easy to understand and you can download it is how much richer the top twenty percent than the bottom twenty percent in each country and you see in the more equal countries on the left japan finland norway sweden the top twenty percent are about three and a half four times as rich as the bottom twenty percent usa singapore the differences are twice as big on that measure we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies we collected data on problems with social gradients the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder internationally comparable data on life expectancy on kids ' maths and literacy scores on infant mortality rates homicide rates proportion of the population in prison teenage birthrates levels of trust mental illness which in standard diagnostic we put them all in one index they 're all weighted equally where a country is is a sort of average score on these things and there you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i 've just shown you which i shall use over and over again in the data but if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to gnp per capita gross national income there 's nothing there no correlation anymore so we also did a paper in the british medical journal on the unicef index of child well being it has forty different components put together by other people it contains whether everything goes there 's no relationship no suggestion of a relationship what all the data i 've shown you so far says is the same thing the average well being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth that 's very important in poorer countries but not in the rich developed world but the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much i 'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index here for instance is trust it 's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted it comes from the world values survey but in the more equal societies it rises to sixty and if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital very similar relationships closely related to inequality we did all this work twice we did it first on these rich developed countries and then as a separate test bed we repeated it all on the fifty american states asking just the same question the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures so here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust same thing is going on basically we found that almost anything that 's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the fifty states in that separate test bed we 're not just talking about a fluke and it goes from about eight percent up to three times that whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of this is violence these red dots are american states and the blue but look at the scale of the differences it goes from fifteen homicides per million up to one hundred and fifty this is the proportion of the population in prison log scale up the side but it goes from about forty to four hundred people in prison that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime harsher sentencing and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty here we have extraordinarily damaging if you 're talking about using the talents of the population it 's actually a measure of mobility based on 's asking do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons or is there no relationship between the two fathers ' income is much more important like to say and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here if americans want to live the american dream they should go to denmark i 've shown you just a few things in italics here i could have shown in more unequal countries not just a little bit worse but anything from twice as common to ten times as common the human cost of that i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points one is that in graph after graph we find the countries that do worse whatever the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones so what we 're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality it 's not just one or two things that go wrong it 's most things the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that if you look at the are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world and it narrows the gap through taxation generous benefits and so on and in our analysis of the american states we find rather the same contrast there are some states that do well through redistribution some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax so we conclude that it doesn 't much matter how you get your greater equality as long as you get there somehow i another really surprising part of this picture there seems to be some truth in john donne 's no man is an island in a number of this is just one example some swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the british register of general socioeconomic and so but then where it says low social class that 's unskilled manual occupations it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle then the junior non manual going up high to the professional occupations we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally and that seems to be the general picture i think i 'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality and of course those feelings whether we 're regarded as attractive clever all that kind of thing the some people reviewed two hundred and eight different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones their responses to doing stressful tasks in the review what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress now we have been criticized of course there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising we never pick and choose data we have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we 're looking at it goes into the analysis our data source decides whether it 's reliable data we don 't otherwise that would introduce bias there are two hundred studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer reviewed journals this isn 't confined to these countries here hiding a very simple demonstration the same countries the same measure of inequality one problem after another why don 't we control for other factors well we 've shown you that gnp per capita doesn 't make any difference and of course others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on what about causality and indeed people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes the big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system the cardiovascular system or for instance the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on i should say that i think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can i think the take home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life"
