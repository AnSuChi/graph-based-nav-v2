  "transcript": "now i think that we can all agree that mathematicians are famously excellent at finding love but it 's not just because conversational skills and excellent pencil cases in my favorite paper on the subject which is entitled why i don 't have a girlfriend peter 's not a very greedy man of all of the available women in the uk all peter 's looking for somebody in the right age range somebody with somebody who 's likely to find him attractive and comes up with an estimate of twenty six women in the whole of the uk put that into perspective that 's about four hundred times fewer than the best estimates of how many intelligent extraterrestrial life forms there are and it also gives peter a one in two hundred and eighty five thousand chance of bumping into any one of these special ladies on a given night out i 'd like to think that 's why mathematicians don 't really bother because love as with most of life ultimately all about the study of patterns patterns from predicting the weather to the fluctuations in the stock market mysterious as love and so to try to persuade you of how totally amazing excellent and relevant mathematics is i want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love because they 're mathematicians they have been collecting data on everybody who uses their site and they 've come up with some seriously interesting findings how attractive you are and actually having people think that you 're ugly can work to your advantage let me show you how this works in a thankfully voluntary are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are on a scale between one and five now if we compare this score the average score to how many messages this is the graph the okcupid guys have come up with and the important thing to notice is that it 's not totally true that the more attractive you are the more messages you get but the question arises then of what is it about people up here so if you take someone like portia de rossi for example everybody agrees that portia de rossi is a very beautiful woman nobody thinks that she 's ugly but she 's not a supermodel either if you compare portia de rossi to someone like sarah jessica parker now a lot of people myself included i should say think that sarah jessica parker is seriously fabulous and possibly one of the most beautiful creatures to have ever have walked on the seem to think that she looks a bit like a horse now and you ask them to give them a score between one and five i reckon that they 'd average out to have roughly the same score but the way that people would vote would be very different so portia 's scores would all be clustered around the four because everybody agrees that she 's very beautiful whereas sarah jessica parker completely divides opinion that 's much better than everybody just thinking that you 're the cute girl next door now i think this begins to make a bit more sense when you think in terms of the people who are sending these messages so let 's say that you think somebody 's attractive but you suspect that other people won 't necessarily be that interested that means there 's less competition for you and it 's an whereas compare that to if you think somebody is attractive but you suspect that everybody is going to think they 're attractive well why would you bother humiliating yourself let 's be the classic people who are perhaps a little bit overweight deliberately choosing a very cropped photo deliberately choosing pictures where they 're wearing hats and the unimportant losers who don 't well so let 's imagine then that you 're a roaring success but the question arises of how do you then convert that success and in particular how do you decide when is the right time to settle you don 't really want to leave it too long jane austen puts it an unmarried woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again thankfully there 's a rather delicious bit of mathematics that we can use to help us out here called optimal stopping theory so let 's imagine then that you start dating when you 're fifteen and ideally you 'd like to be married a number of people that you could potentially date across your lifetime and they 'll be at varying levels of goodness now the rules are that once you cash in and get married you can 't look ahead to see what you could have had and equally you can 't go back and change your mind in my experience at least i find that typically people don 't much like being recalled years after being passed up for somebody else or so the math says then that what you should do in the first you should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential laughter and then you should pick the next person that comes along that is better than everybody that you 've seen before so here 's now if you do this it can be mathematically proven in fact that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chances of finding the perfect partner now unfortunately i have to tell you that this method does come with some risks imagine if your perfect partner appeared during your first thirty seven percent now unfortunately you 'd have to reject them laughter now if you 're following the maths i 'm afraid no one else comes along that 's better than anyone you 've seen before have to go on rejecting everyone and die alone another risk thirty seven percent are just incredibly so that 's fine you can reject them but then imagine the next person to come along is just marginally less boring dull and terrible now if you are following the maths i 'm afraid you have to marry them but i do think that there 's an opportunity here for hallmark to cash in on and really cater for this market a valentine 's day card like this my darling husband you are marginally less terrible than the first thirty seven percent of people i dated it 's actually more romantic than i normally manage ok so and actually in the wild and then they pick the next fish that comes along after that window that 's i don 't i also think that we do sort of do this anyway we give ourselves a little bit of time to and then we only start looking seriously at potential marriage candidates once i think this is conclusive proof if ever it were needed that everybody 's brains are prewired to be just a little bit mathematical ok so that was top tip # two now top tip # three how to avoid divorce ok so let 's imagine then that you picked your perfect partner and you 're settling into a lifelong apart from i don 't know piers morgan 's wife maybe laughter but it 's a sad fact of modern life that one in two marriages in the states ends in divorce with the rest of the world not being far behind now you can be forgiven perhaps for thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup are not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation for one thing it 's very hard to know what you should be measuring or what you should be quantifying but this didn 't stop john gottman observed hundreds of couples well everything you can think of so he recorded what was said in the conversation he recorded their skin conductivity he recorded their facial expressions their which incidentally she totally is his team found was that one of the most important predictors for whether or not a couple is going to get divorced was how positive or negative each partner was being in the conversation now couples that were very low risk scored a lot more positive points on gottman 's scale than negative whereas bad relationships by which i mean probably going to get divorced gottman and his group and the results that they found i think incredibly impressively simple and interesting so these equations predict how the wife or husband is going to respond in their next turn of the conversation how positive or negative they 're going to be and these equations depend on but most importantly they depend now i think it 's important to point out at this stage that these exact equations have also been shown to be perfectly able at describing what happens between two countries in an arms race so that an arguing couple spiraling into negativity and teetering on the brink of divorce is actually mathematically equivalent to the beginning of a nuclear war laughter but the really important term in this equation is the influence that people have on one another and in particular something called the negativity threshold now the negativity threshold you can think of as how annoying the husband can be before the wife starts to get really pissed off i always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding and allowing the person to have the space to be themselves so i would have thought that perhaps the most successful relationships ones with a really low negativity threshold these are the couples that don 't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other some room to complain these are the couples that are continually trying to repair their own relationship that have a much more positive outlook on their marriage couples that don 't let things go and couples that don 't let trivial things end up being a really big now of course it takes a bit more than just a low negativity threshold and not compromising to have a successful relationship but i think that it 's quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger but i hope that aside from their use as tips they also give you a little bit of insight into the power of mathematics because for me equations and symbols aren 't just a thing they 're a voice that speaks out about the incredible richness of nature and the startling simplicity in the patterns that twist and turn and warp and evolve all around us from how the world works to how we behave perhaps for just a couple of you a little bit of insight into the mathematics of love can persuade you to have a little bit more love for mathematics thank you"
