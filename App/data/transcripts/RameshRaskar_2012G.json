  "transcript": "and curiosity with this photo of a bullet fifty years later we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million i present to you a new type of photography a new imaging technique so fast or see inside our body without an x ray and really challenge what we mean by a camera now if i take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second which is several femtoseconds i 'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide and again a million times faster than an ordinary if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire how does light look in slow motion now remember the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond that 's how much time it takes for light to travel but i 'm slowing down so you can see the light in motion but coca cola did not sponsor this research now there 's a lot going on in this movie so let me break this down and show you what 's going on so the pulse enters the bottle our bullet with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside some of the light leaks as you can see there 's a bubble of air and it 's bouncing around inside meanwhile now if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of ten billion do you know how long you 'll have to sit here to watch that movie it 'll be a very boring movie and what about some photography washing over the table the tomato and the wall in the back it 's like throwing a stone in a pond of water i thought this is how nature it continues to glow it doesn 't become dark why is that when this femto camera is in your camera phone you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it so how did my team at mit create this camera but we 're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure so you we computationally weave together to create femto videos i showed you and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways so superman can fly some other heroes can become invisible the idea is that we could shine some light on the door it 's going to and it 's not science fiction we have actually built it on the left you see our femto camera they will scatter in all the some of them will reach our hidden mannequin which in turn will again scatter that light but most interestingly they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot and because we have a camera that can run so fast our and this way we know the distances but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance which if you look on the screen 't really make any sense and from that can we see the hidden object can we see it in full 3d so this is our reconstruction or we can build endoscopes femto photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of the time between each of it turns out because we 're recording we have strange effects effects and einstein would have loved to see this picture the order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order so whether it 's for photography around corners we have open sourced all the data and details on our website and our hope is that the diy the creative and the research communities will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels thank you"
