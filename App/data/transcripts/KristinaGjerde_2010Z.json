  "transcript": "so unexplored it 's a place of myth and legend it 's a place marked on ancient maps as here be monsters it is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed instead they just make me green with envy that my colleague from iucn was able to go on this journey to the south of madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep a legal term but in fact it covers fifty percent of the planet with an average depth of the oceans of four thousand meters in fact the high seas covers and provides nearly ninety percent of the habitat for life on this earth but in reality it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it so today i 'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas and then finally going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that 's rooted in so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above that area in the darker blue this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen the global ocean that provides us all with carbon storage with heat storage with oxygen if you can only protect thirty six percent this is indeed the true heart of the planet some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws for example provide more protection to the areas closest to shore garbage discharge something you would think just simply goes away but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore as a result we have garbage patches the size to pollution was so what we have learned from social scientists and economists like elinor ostrom who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open for the good of one and all and these include a sense of shared responsibility common norms that bind people together as a community and of course if you want people to play by the rules you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement for as we 've discovered you can trust but you also need to verify for a group of very dedicated individuals scientists conservationists photographers and states were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this so within three instead of go anywhere do anything you want we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you 're going and a duty to prevent significant harm in two thousand and nine when the u n reviewed progress square kilometers of seabed had been protected but what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed to create a new regime so i 'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true blue perspective for this beautiful planet sylvia 's wish provides us with that leverage but are now hopefully going to become interested today we 're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain the sargasso sea for example is not a sea bounded by coastlines but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there 's also known as the spawning ground but the sargasso sea the same way it aggregates sargassum weed actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region doesn 't exactly show the plastics that i would like it to show because i haven 't been out there myself but there has just been a study that was released in february that showed there are two hundred thousand pieces of plastic per now floating in the surface of the sargasso sea and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the sargasso sea for its protection its food the sargasso sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat but what i 'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection thus the government of bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the sargasso sea within its national jurisdiction but the vast majority is beyond to help spearhead a movement to achieve it 's considered high seas because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims but what makes the ross sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what till recently has been near shore ecosystem but unfortunately regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of the captain of a new zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the ross sea killer whales who are directly dependent on the antarctic toothfish as their main source of food so singly and together to push governments to push regional fisheries management organizations to declare our right to declare certain areas off limits to high seas fishing so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime but what 's unusual about the costa rica dome is in fact it 's not a permanent place it 's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis but it moves with the season as such it does create a challenge but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it we can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are in order to close which may in some cases be year round many species are headed through this region which is why there 's been so much attention put into conservation of the eastern tropical pacific seascape this is the initiative that 's been coordinated by conservation international with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area the world heritage convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction at present so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these world heritage sites or we need to change the name and call it but what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the eastern tropical pacific seascape these happen to go down to a vast south we need to work locally but we also need to work we have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader initiative we 've heard about the tagging of pacific predators project one of the seventeen census of marine life projects it 's provided us data like this of tiny little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean so stay tuned for further information what i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators it 's also looked in the really unexplored mid water column where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found and fortunately we 've been able as iucn to team up with the census of marine life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers we have the support of governments now behind us we 've been revealing this information through technical workshops and the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to we need more we need to move forward if you get these marine protected areas or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place how are you going to enforce it which leads me to my second passion so i 've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor earth from outer space and that we life cycles in the open ocean we can also tag and track fishing vessels but not all the vessels have those to date it does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws so it brings me to my main take home message which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons we can stop the collision course of fifty percent of the planet we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect which is the joy and marvel of sylvia 's hope spot wish is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas and to bring people to the table if you will to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management and third is that we need to look at management our species are many of the deep sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean basin wide we need to better understand but we also need to start to manage and protect and in order to do that you also need so they 're like the southern ocean where they do have the two pronged fisheries and conservation organization so with that i would just like to sincerely thank and honor sylvia earle for her wish for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national it 's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to one that it is our home too and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all"
