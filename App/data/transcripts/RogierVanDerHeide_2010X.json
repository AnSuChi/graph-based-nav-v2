  "transcript": "statement on the screen that says light creates ambiance light makes the feel of a space and light is also the expression of structure the famous architect and here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings the chapel and i think that is the quintessence of this so this is how we normally would light our offices we have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux this is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps and that is quite different from what i just showed you from le corbusier because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same the same is more or less what santiago calatrava said when he said light i make it in my buildings for comfort and he didn 't mean the comfort of a five course dinner but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people he meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience and he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky and where you can experience the sun that give us a better life in the built environment just because of the relevance of light and and this image of the sun may suggest that the sun is something evil and aggressive but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes and light is only a manifestation of that energy the sun is for dynamics for color changes the sun is for beauty in our environment like in this building which has been created by renzo piano from italy together with arup lighting a brilliant team of lighting designers so in an indirect way you can see and what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum they created this shade that you can see here which but opens up to the good light from the sky and here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models with quantitative as well as qualitative methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture and they and enjoying the sun can be or maybe like this which is rather peculiar but this is the viewing of a sun eclipse so these people have found a very intriguing solution this is i think a very illustrative image of what i try to say that the beautiful dynamics of sun bringing these into the building creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness of course because otherwise you don 't see these dynamics as opposed to the first office that i showed you in the beginning of the talk this is a well known office which is the weidt group they are in green energy consulting or something like that and they really practice what they preach because this office doesn 't have any electric lighting at all it has only on one side big big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range but actually the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull and therefore i really owe a short introduction of this man to you this is richard kelly who was born one hundred years ago which is the reason i bring him up now because it 's kind of an anniversary year in the richard kelly was the first person to really describe a different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this this is so impressive just because of this focal point this huge light source in the middle it could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land highlighting it or it can be in today 's retail in the shopping environment ambient luminescence is something very different richard kelly saw it as something infinite something without any focus something where all details i see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax it could also be something like this the national museum of science in london where and then finally kelly 's play of brilliants added to that the icing on the cake something playful something that is just an addition to the architectural environment i would say and i guess that is something that richard kelly here on and behind them you see that seagram building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design those times there were some early attempts also for light therapy already you can see here a photo from the united states library of medicine where people are put in the sun in today 's and there is the idea that when we look at things it is the yellow light that helps us the most that we are the most sensitive for but our circadian rhythms which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert relaxed and so forth and so on they are much more triggered by blue light and that is how maybe in the near future light can help hospitals to recover them quicker maybe in the airplane we can overcome jet lag like that perhaps but i would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life so light is of course social interaction also to create relationships with all the features around us it never reaches the so and i mean that is quite amazing what you see here how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground because if we look at the earth the way it something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything the world is changing though and urbanization is a big driver of everything i took this photo two weeks ago in guangzhou and i realized that ten years ago there was nothing like this of these buildings and we have to understand these main questions how do people move through these new urban spaces how do they share their culture how do we tackle things like mobility and how can light help there because the new technologies they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and provide us with better environments it 's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps and of course we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that now we have led but here you see the latest one and you see how incredibly small it is and this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity because this tiny tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it and we can actually leave it out where it 's not needed at all and a new way of lighting so i asked so here it is so just this is not very pleasant and comfortable and for that reason we cover the led with a phosphor cap and the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant and then when you add the lens to that you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it so you can preserve the darkness and make the light i just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works thank you so we have to rethink the way we light our cities we have to think again about light as a default solution why are all these motorways can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness like here this is a very low light level actually or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around and can we preserve the darkness because to find a place like this today on earth is really very very challenging and to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult even in the oceans we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well being and we discovered that when we make those lights green the birds they actually go the right way they are not disturbed turns out once again that spectral sensitivity i think we should start making the light out of darkness and use the darkness as a canvas i think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting edward hopper was a real master and we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments and you can still also go outside and so i give you this wonderful informative image where you may see one or two stars and all the way to the rural environments where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars in architecture it works just the same by appreciating the darkness this is the most well known example tadao ando 's church of the light but i also think of peter zumthor 's spa in vals or richard maccormac 's southwark tube station in london and i think it 's fantastic that we are today experiencing tedx in a theater for the first time because i think we really owe to the theater a and i think the theater is a place thank you very much"
