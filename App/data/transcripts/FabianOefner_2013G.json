  "transcript": "so i 'm going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that i recently captured by now my talk is already six thousand words long and i feel like i should stop here at the same time i probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw whether it 's a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint strange liquids that or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces what i find very intriguing about those two and if you look at science on one hand whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings what i am trying to do is i 'm trying to bring those two views into one let me demonstrate this based on three projects so if you have a speaker a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal transform it into and transformed into an audio signal again now i was thinking how can i make those sound waves visible and then i added tiny little crystals and now if i would play a now this happens very fast in the blink of an eye let me show you what this looks like but i have to tell you a funny story and what happened is that if you 're shooting at three thousand frames per second you need to have a silly amount of light lots of lights and i would set up the speaker put the tiny little crystals and it was until midday that i realized that i had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker what of my face was completely red and i looked like the phantom of the opera for the rest of the let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances should i skip that part so if i now put this liquid into a magnetic field it would change its appearance now i 've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you now i 'm going to add some of that ferrofluid to that magnet let slightly move it to the right and maybe focus it a little bit more so what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes this is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles now this looks already quite interesting but let me now add some watercolors to it those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with you wouldn 't paint with syringes but it works just the same so what happened now is when the watercolor was flowing into the structure the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid that 's because the ferrofluid itself and at the same time it tries to maintain its position above the let me now turn to the last project which involves the national beverage of scotland and also this one were made using whiskey how did he do that did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then draw the hallucination he got from being drunk onto paper i can assure you i was fully conscious while i was taking those pictures and alcohol has got some very interesting properties but i am talking about the physical properties not so when i open the bottle and it was with those two properties that i was able to create the images that you 're seeing right now let me demonstrate this over here and now i 'm and now let 's set that on fire goes really fast and it 's not that but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey and that i should rather drink it but let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what i just showed you in this live so what happened is that the they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle so that 's how those images were made thank you so what is it good for what 's the idea behind it is it just a waste of whiskey is it just some strange materials or over here the physical properties of a substance and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a thank you very much"
