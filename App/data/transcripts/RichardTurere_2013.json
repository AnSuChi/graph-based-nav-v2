  "transcript": "and behind the cows that 's the nairobi national park nairobi national park is not fenced in the south widely which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely so predators like lions and this is what they do they kill our livestock this and i felt so bad because it was the only bull we had my community the maasai we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land the morans are the warriors who protect our community so so a boy from six to nine and the first idea i got because i thought lions but i came to realize that that didn 't really help because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed and a second idea i got but lions are very clever they will come the first day and they see the and that day the lions didn 't come and i discovered that lions so i had an idea i used to work in my room for the whole day and that day she almost killed me but i learned a lot about electronics so i got an old car battery and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left it blinks and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box i call it a transformer indicator box and that 's how it looks to lions when they come at night the lights but i was sleeping in my bed and my neighboring homes heard about this idea one of them was this grandmother she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions and she asked me if i could put the lights for since now i 've set up seven homes around my community and they 're really working and my idea is also being used now all over kenya leopards and it 's also being used to scare elephants away from people 's farms i was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools and i 'm really excited about this my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness i even took my friends back to my community and we 're installing the lights i was just a boy in the savanna grassland and i told myself that one day i 'll be there a chance to come by plane for my first time for ted so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when i grow up but now because my invention is saving my father 's cows and the lions we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours so you got invention is i want to make an electric fence ca electric fence rt but i know electric fences are already invented but i want to make mine ca you already tried it once right and you rt i tried it before but i stopped because it gave me a shock"
