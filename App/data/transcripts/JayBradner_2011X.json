  "transcript": "ten years ago from chicago with an interest in cancer and in chemistry you might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules or to my taste new drugs for and you might also know that for science and medicine boston is a bit of a candy store you can 't roll a stop sign in cambridge without hitting a graduate student the bar is called the miracle of science the billboards say lab space available and it 's fair to say that in these ten years we 've witnessed we know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever this information is also pretty staggering you might know that so far in just the dawn of this revolution we know that there are perhaps forty thousand unique mutations affecting more than ten thousand genes and that there are five hundred of these genes that and this inadequacy of cancer medicine really hit home it 's been known for decades what this is old information we 've known since about the 80s yet there 's no medicine i can prescribe to a patient with this or any of the of the numerous solid tumors caused by these three why is that and the very unsatisfying yet scientific answer is too hard that for whatever reason these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that 's called the undruggable genome but what it means is that we 've failed to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins into which we like molecular locksmiths can fashion an active small or drug substance cascading through the regulatory network at the fda were these substances arsenic thalidomide and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard and so i guess you 'd say dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines i went back to school in chemistry the collaborative network that we have access to within that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies please consider this a work in progress but i 'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma about the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer called brd4 and about a molecule developed at my lab at dana farber cancer institute why does it not turn into an eye into a liver as it has all the genes necessary to do this it remembers that it 's cancer like every cell in the body places little molecular i should keep growing and those post it notes involve this and other proteins of its class so called bromodomains so we developed an idea a rationale that perhaps if we made a molecule that prevented the post it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein then maybe we could convince cancer cells certainly jq1 now not being a drug company we could do certain things we had certain flexibilities that i have a small lab we thought we 'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves we sent it to oxford england where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture which helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent for this protein target it 's what we call a perfect fit of shape complementarity or hand in glove now we observed something really striking the cancer cells small round and rapidly dividing grew these arms and extensions they were changing shape the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell this got us very excited and so at the time we were doing this research i was caring for a 29 year old firefighter from connecticut who was very much at the end of life with this incurable cancer and he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris and every nursing shift we would throw this and so we approached this patient and asked if he would collaborate with us could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial at a stage that with a prototype drug well that would be of course impossible and rightly illegal to do in and he obliged us and you can see this pet scan of a mouse what we call a pet pet the cancer is growing as this red huge mass in the hind limb of this animal and as we treat it with our compound this addiction to sugar this rapid growth faded and on the animal on the right you see that the cancer was responding and the ones that don 't rapidly perish so we started to wonder what would a drug company do at this point well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn the prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance so we did just the opposite published a paper typically a secret in our discipline we told people exactly how to make it we gave them our email address suggesting that if they write us we 'll send them a free molecule laughter we basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible and this was unfortunately successful we 've shared this molecule just since december of last year with forty laboratories in the united states and thirty more in europe thankfully right now but the science that 's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule leukemia cells treated with this compound turn into normal white blood cells respond dramatically to the treatment with this drug you might know that in fact this molecule prevents this adipocyte this fat stem cell from remembering like the folks in my hometown of chicago which is a major medical problem and harvard medical school more generally is that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery that our center which has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other never made one of its own for all the reasons you see listed here we think there 's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest conceptually tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery so what next we have this molecule but it 's not a pill yet it 's not orally it 's we don 't have a pipeline that we can deposit these molecules into we don 't have a team of salespeople and marketeers to tell us how to position this drug against the other what we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent hopefully well funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide this molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small start up company called tensha therapeutics and really this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of graduate from our little pipeline of drug discovery two of which a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin and an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma will actually come to the trial in july of this year for us a major and exciting milestone i want to leave you with just two ideas it 's less the science than the strategy this for us was a social experiment an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be this string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses that can be texted i suppose or twittered worldwide is the chemical identity of our pro compound it 's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies the information on how these early prototype drugs might work yet this information is largely a secret and so we seek really to download from the amazing successes of the computer science industry two principles that of open source and that of crowdsourcing to quickly responsibly now the business model it 's funded by foundations one thing i 've learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer and i love that you bike across the state you walk up and down the river and so i want to thank you for your participation your collaboration and most of all for your confidence in our ideas"
