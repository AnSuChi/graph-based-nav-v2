  "transcript": "it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life back then fifteen years ago we didn 't have the ability to look inside the living human brain and track development across the lifespan neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages and to track changes in brain structure and brain function so we use structural mri if you 'd like to take a snapshot a photograph at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain and we can ask and we also use functional mri called fmri to take a video a movie of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something so many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development by revealing that it 's not all over in early childhood and instead the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the ' 20s and ' 30s so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological hormonal physical changes of puberty ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable independent role in society it can go on a long time so this is this is a model of the human brain and this is prefrontal cortex right at the front prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain inhibiting inappropriate behavior so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid it 's also involved in social interaction understanding other people and self awareness so mri studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period so if you look at gray matter volume for example gray matter volume across age from age four to twenty two years increases during childhood which is what you can see on this peaks in early adolescence the arrows indicate peak gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex you can see that that peak happens a couple of years later in boys relative to girls and that 's probably because boys go through puberty a couple of years later than girls on average and then during and this decline in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning the elimination of unwanted synapses this is a really it 's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in synapses that are being used are strengthened and synapses that aren 't being used in that particular environment are pruned away you can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining important branches can grow stronger and this process which effectively brain tissue according to the environment is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions during the period of human adolescence so so i 'll just give you an example we 're interested in the social brain that is the network of brain regions that we use to understand other people and to interact with other so i like to show so this is a soccer game michael owen has just missed a goal and he 's lying on the ground and the first aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic and instinctive social emotional responses are so within a split second of michael owen missing this goal everyone is doing the same thing with their arms and the same thing with their face even michael owen as he slides along the grass is doing the same with his arms and presumably has a similar facial expression and the only people who don 't are the guys in yellow at the back and i think they 're on the wrong end of the stadium and they 're doing another social emotional response that we all instantly recognize and that 's the second aspect of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates how good we are at reading other people 's behavior their actions their gestures their facial expressions so you don 't have to ask any of these guys you have a pretty good idea of what they 're feeling and thinking at this precise moment in time so that 's what we 're interested in looking at in my lab so in my lab we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people their minds their mental states their emotions and one of the findings that we 've found several times now as have other labs around the world is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex which is shown in blue on the slide and it 's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head this region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults and this is actually a meta analysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world and they all show the same thing that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases during the period of adolescence and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task you see this computerized task now there are objects on these shelves on some of them and and there are some objects that he can 't see they 're occluded from his point of view kind of gray piece of wood whereas there are many more objects that you can see now your task is to move objects around the director standing behind the set of shelves is going to direct you to move objects around but remember he 's not going to ask you to move objects that he can 't see this introduces a really interesting condition whereby there 's a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director 's perspective so imagine he tells you to move the top truck left there are three trucks there you 're going to instinctively go for the white truck because that 's the top truck from your perspective but then you have to remember oh he can 't see that truck so he must mean me to move the blue truck which is the top so we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults and we also have a control condition where there 's no director and instead we give people a rule we tell them okay we 're going to do exactly the same thing but this time there 's no director instead you 've got to ignore objects with the dark gray background you 'll see that this is exactly the same condition only in the no director condition they just have to remember to apply whereas in the director condition they have to remember to take into account the to adulthood and what you 're going to see is the percentage errors in the adult group in both conditions so the gray is the director condition and you see that our intelligent adults are making errors about fifty percent improvement in other words a reduction of errors in both of these trials in both of these conditions but it 's when you compare the last two groups the mid adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting because there everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid adolescence whereas in contrast if you look at the last two gray there 's still a significant improvement in the director condition between and adulthood and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else 's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior which is something by the way that we do in everyday life all the time so if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you sometimes think they have problems taking so we we sometimes laugh about teenagers they 're parodied sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior they take risks they 're sometimes moody i have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine who said that the thing he noticed most about his teenage daughters before and after puberty was their level of embarrassment in front of him so he said before puberty if my two daughters were messing around in a shop i 'd say ' hey stop messing around and i 'll sing your favorite song ' and instantly they 'd stop messing around and he 'd sing their favorite song after puberty that became the threat is it something we 've invented recently in the west and actually the answer is probably not there are lots of descriptions of adolescence in in history that sound very similar to the descriptions we use today so there 's a famous quote by shakespeare from the winter 's tale where he describes adolescence as follows or that youth would sleep out the rest for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancientry stealing fighting he then goes on to say having said that would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two and twenty hunt in this weather laughter so almost four hundred years ago shakespeare was portraying adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today so for example take risk taking we know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks they do they take more risks than children or adults and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they 're with their friends there 's an important drive to become independent from one 's parents and to impress one 's friends in adolescence but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system so i 'm going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me and also on this brain so the limbic system is right deep inside the brain and it 's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing and this region the regions within the limbic system have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk taking in adolescents compared with adults which stops us taking excessive risks is still very much in development in so brain research has shown that the adolescent brain undergoes really quite profound development and this has implications for education for rehabilitation including teaching can and does shape the developing adolescent brain and yet it 's only relatively recently that we have been routinely educating teenagers in the west all four of my for example left school and that 's still the case for many many teenagers around the world today forty percent of teenagers don 't have access to secondary school and yet this is a period of life where the brain is particularly changes in the adolescent brain"
